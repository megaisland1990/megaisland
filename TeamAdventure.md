
Legend of Mermaid
-------------------------
The rainbow wind blows at a far off coast
Before dawn, there was a melody I heard
It's a very nostalgic song

The birds that fly towards the eastern sky
now escape to the treasure island using this shortcut.

Where the paradise of the seven seas lies
After the stormy night, to tell you my love I will be born again
Even if there comes a day where everyone...
Is to journey away from here, as long as we sing the melody of the seven countries
I'll never forget.

Clouds slowly float away, vanishing away as they aim for the rainbow's end
And then the stars, like pearls
can start releasing a powerful, wondrous light.

From the southern sky, a whistling sound could be heard
Yes, this is the time that's finally come, the time for me to become an adult.

While embracing the kind mother's wishes in her heart
She wished that everyone would journey on a miracle-filled adventure
With overflowing tears and prayers, I just don't know anymore
But their still remains a fantasy of a night where stars fall for the shining future!

To the paradise of the seven seas!
After the stormy night, to tell you my love I will be born again
Even if there comes a day where everyone...
Is to journey away from here, as long as we sing the melody of the seven countries
I'll never forget!

While embracing the kind mother's wishes in her heart
She wished that everyone would journey on a miracle-filled adventure
With over flowing tears and prayers, I just don't know anymore
But their still remains a fantasy of a night where stars fall
For the shining future!


Kizuna
-----------------------------
The tears that hurt so much overflow in the nightly depths of the sea.
But as I stretch my hand across the glass surface of the water, light reaches them.

The only things I can see can only hear my voice.
Realize the fact that it's not everything.
The things I can believe have all increased by one, and now I can become stronger

After being hurt, I'm shining again and feel our invincible bonds.
It isn't someone, it has to be you.
Through all the pain, I still pursue to increase them.
If miracles overlap over one another, it would seem like they could change fate.
Throwing away all doubts and darkness, I believe in our strong bonds.
