Ash:

-------------------------------------
He is a Pokémon Trainer from Pallet Town whose goal is to become a Pokémon Master. His first Pokémon was a Pikachu that he received from Professor Oak after arriving late at his laboratory. On his journeys around the Pokémon world, he's been accompanied by a multitude of close friends.
In Galar, he becomes the new Monarch and World Champion of the Pokémon World Coronation Series.
Ash grew up in Pallet Town in the Kanto region with his mother, Delia, as his father spent most of his time traveling. Eventually, Ash would meet Professor Oak and his grandson Gary Oak.

In Seeing the Forest for the Trees!, Ash remembered getting lost in a forest while looking for Pokémon. He brought some wild Pokémon out of the rain and found them some shelter in a tree trunk. Ash's happiness about that moment made him think about how much he wanted to become a Pokémon Trainer.


Young Ash and Gary watching a movie
At the age of six, Ash learned that Professor Oak would be holding a Pokémon Summer Camp, and eagerly asked his mother Delia if he could attend. Seeing her son's enthusiasm, she signed him up but also told him that she had things to do outside of the home during the day the camp would take place, so he would have to get himself there in time on his own. Unfortunately for Ash, he ended up breaking his alarm clock in his sleep and overslept, missing the camp.

Later, Ash managed to attend another one of Professor Oak's Pokémon Summer Camps. One day, another camper named Serena got lost in the forest and wounded her leg after getting startled by a Poliwag. Ash, who was looking for the Poliwag, came to her rescue and wrapped a handkerchief around the wounded knee to brace it. He then helped her up and guided her out of the forest.

As seen in Lights, Camerupt, Action!, Ash and Gary used to be friends at one point in time and even went to watch movies together. In The Ties That Bind, Ash recalled a day when he was about to start his Pokémon journey. He and Gary Oak both fished out an old, rusty Poké Ball, which snagged on both their lines. After arguing about who would keep it, they broke it in two, each keeping one half as a reminder of that day.


Original series

Ash trying to keep Pikachu safe
In Pokémon - I Choose You!, Ash began his journey at the age of 10 as a warm-hearted and well-intentioned but stubborn, rash, and amateur Pokémon Trainer. He was forced to accept a stubborn Pikachu from Professor Oak as his first Pokémon because he woke up late on the day he was set to get his first Pokémon. He was determined to achieve his goal and when Pikachu saw that he was willing to compromise his safety to keep it safe, the two of them formed an extremely strong bond that has been noticed and remarked upon by many characters in the anime. This unbreakable friendship would set his course for the future.

In Pokémon Emergency!, Misty told off Ash after she found her bike Ash had "borrowed" to save Pikachu with was wrecked. At the end of the episode, Team Rocket made it their primary objective to steal Pikachu after witnessing Pikachu's power. Misty continued following Ash as he headed for Pewter City, telling him in Showdown in Pewter City that she would continue following him until she was paid back for the bike.

Ash caught his first Pokémon, a Caterpie, in Ash Catches a Pokémon, followed by a Pidgeotto the next day.

In Showdown in Pewter City, Ash decided to compete in the Pokémon League regional championships by earning Badges from Gym Leaders across the Kanto region. Ash fought Brock, the Pewter Gym Leader, in a Pokémon battle and lost easily. During his rematch, Ash nearly defeated Brock but refused to give the final blow due to the intervention of Brock's younger siblings. Touched by Ash's kindness to Pokémon and with the return of his estranged father, Flint, Brock decided to go with Ash and pursue his dream of being the world's best Pokémon Breeder and gave Ash the Boulder Badge.

In The Water Flowers of Cerulean City, Ash reached the Cerulean Gym and was shocked to learn that Misty was one of its Gym Leaders. Though the match was interrupted when Team Rocket tried to steal the Pokémon from the Gym, Misty's sisters awarded Ash a Cascade Badge when Pikachu saved the Gym with a Thunderbolt. He continued his journey with Misty, who had dreams of becoming the world's greatest Water Pokémon Master.


Ash and his Kanto first partner Pokémon
Ash would go on to obtain the remaining Kanto first partner Pokémon. In Bulbasaur and the Hidden Village, Ash and friends found a Hidden Village protected by a Bulbasaur. Although hostile at first, Bulbasaur warmed up to Ash after he saved an Oddish from Team Rocket. Bulbasaur agreed to join Ash if he could defeat it in battle, which he did with Pikachu, adding Bulbasaur to his team. In Charmander – The Stray Pokémon, Ash and friends discovered a Charmander that had been left in the rain by his former Trainer, Damian. Brock carried Charmander to the Pokémon Center, while Ash held his coat over the Charmander's tail flame to keep it lit. After Charmander saved Pikachu from being taken by Team Rocket, Ash caught him. In Here Comes the Squirtle Squad, Ash and friends met the Squirtle Squad, a rogue group of Squirtle who were deserted by their Trainers. They were tricked by Team Rocket into capturing Pikachu, after which they betrayed and bombed them. Ash went back to rescue the Squirtle leader, which touched it enough to join his team. The remaining members left with Officer Jenny to become firefighters.

Every time he thought he was doing well, Ash would somehow cross paths with his childhood rival, Gary. Gary and Professor Oak reminded Ash that he was always a step behind Gary. In Mystery at the Lighthouse, Professor Oak told Ash that Gary had caught 45 Pokémon at a point when Ash only had seven.

In Island of the Giant Pokémon, Ash and his friends were swept away onto Pokémon Land, located on the Island of the Giant Pokémon, after a group of Gyarados triggered a cyclone using Dragon Rage. Four of Ash's Pokémon, including Pikachu, had gone missing during the chaos, but they found their way back to him the following day. Ash and the others took a ferry back to the mainland from Tentacool & Tentacruel to The Ghost of Maiden's Peak.


Ash with Misty and Tracey
Many of Ash's first Gym Badges were given to him merely out of gratitude for his assistance, rather than claiming an actual victory in battle over the Gym Leaders. Of the first five Gym Badges that had been given to Ash in Kanto, only Lt. Surge's Thunder Badge in Electric Shock Showdown was earned from a victory in battle.

Ash's troubles were not made any easier when his Charmander, after evolving into a Charmeleon, and then a Charizard, grew too powerful and refused to listen to him until Ash could prove himself.

Over time, Ash's dedication to his goal paid off. After earning his first eight Badges, Ash went on to compete in the Indigo Plateau Conference, advancing to the fifth round - one further than Gary - and ending up in the Top 16, his defeat coming in the form of his Charizard refusing to battle for him.


Ash in the Orange League Hall of Fame
Following Ash's defeat in the Indigo League, Professor Oak asked him to travel to Valencia Island in the Orange Islands to retrieve the GS Ball from a Pokémon Professor named Ivy. While in the Orange Islands, Ash learned of the Orange Crew, an elite group of Trainers not unlike Gym Leaders, that provided challenges for Trainers to overcome in the Orange League. After Brock decided to stay with Professor Ivy and help her with her work, Ash and Misty were joined by an enthusiastic Pokémon Watcher named Tracey Sketchit. Ash, Misty, and Tracey traversed the Orange Islands on the back of a lost Lapras. Ash caught the Lapras during this time. He eventually defeated the four members of the Orange Crew and finally won the Orange League by triumphing over the Orange Crew Supreme Gym Leader, Drake, becoming an Honored Trainer and earning himself a spot in the Orange League Hall of Fame. Before leaving the Orange Islands, Ash managed to find his Lapras's pod and released it back into the wild.

Upon returning to Pallet Town, Ash discovered that Brock had returned due to some unknown incident that left the aspiring Pokémon Breeder in dread of even hearing Professor Ivy's name. Meanwhile, Tracey stayed at Professor Oak's Laboratory as Professor Oak's assistant, and Brock rejoined Ash and Misty. After his victory in the Orange League, Ash encountered Gary again, and after being defeated in a one-on-one battle, he learned that his rival had been training hard to participate in the Silver Conference in Johto.

Excited at the prospect of meeting new Pokémon and facing Gary again, Ash and friends left for the Johto region to collect eight Badges from the Gym Leaders in the Johto region and compete in the Johto League. Much like his travels through Kanto, Ash, Misty, and Brock impacted the many people and Pokémon they met along the way (one of them being Kurt, to whom Ash delivered the GS Ball).

In The Grass Route, Ash competed in the Grass Tournament with Bulbasaur. He lost in the final round to Ephraim's Skiploom.

Ash, along with Misty, competed in the Whirl Cup in the Whirl Islands, with Ash placing in the Top 16. He was defeated by Misty in a 2-on-2; Misty ended up losing in the next round. Ash, along with Ritchie, then helped save Silver, a child Lugia, and its parent, from the evil machinations of Team Rocket.

Ash encountered Gary occasionally in Johto, and, while they were still rivals, Gary seemed to view Ash with slightly more respect than before. Ash's growth of character was evident throughout this story arc as he continued to think more and more about his Pokémon and less and less about himself. After earning eight Johto Gym Badges, Ash entered the Silver Conference with Gary. Finally, the two rivals battled in the tournament in a Full Battle. Although it was a close battle, Ash emerged victorious against his rival for the first time in his career as a Pokémon Trainer, marking one of the biggest turning points in said career. After the battle, Gary and Ash departed on good terms with each other, finally overcoming their boyhood animosity and recognizing each other as equals. Ash's journey through Kanto and Johto came to an end when he was forced to split up with Brock and Misty when the two of them received messages to return home.


Pokémon the Series: Ruby and Sapphire

Ash with Brock, May, and Max
After hearing about a distant region called Hoenn from Harrison, the opponent he lost to in the Silver Conference, Ash decided to journey there and take only Pikachu with him this time. In Hoenn, Ash met a girl named May and her brother, Max, who he later learned were Petalburg Gym Leader Norman's children, and both of whom decided to join Ash on his travels. Shortly after the three companions left Petalburg City, Brock rejoined the group when he saved them from a flock of angry Taillow and their leader. From that point onward, Ash journeyed through Hoenn with one old friend and two new friends, collecting Gym Badges in much the same fashion as before. Once May set her sights on becoming a Top Coordinator, Ash supported her whenever he could while maintaining his focus on winning Badges. During these journeys, Ash and his friends ended up being entwined in the plots of the region's two rivaling villainous teams, Team Aqua and Team Magma, with Pikachu getting possessed by Groudon in the summit of their conflict. Thanks to Team Rocket's unintentional help, they helped save the entire Hoenn region.

While Ash had no major recurring rival in Hoenn, he did encounter certain Trainers multiple times and formed friendly rivalries with them. One such friend was Morrison, who was very similar to and just as competitive as Ash and was first introduced close to the end of the group's travels in Hoenn. Just like the Indigo Plateau and Silver Conferences, Ash did not win the Ever Grande Conference, but he came very close before losing to Tyson, who went on to win the tournament. After parting ways with May, Max, and Brock, Ash returned to Pallet Town. As he passed through Viridian City on his way back home, he met Scott and Agatha and learned about the Battle Frontier in Kanto. He decided to take on the Battle Frontier and was surprised but happy to learn that Brock, May, and Max would join him on this adventure as well. Eventually, Ash conquered the seven Frontier Brains and was offered the opportunity to become a Frontier Brain himself, but declined in favor of continuing his Pokémon journey.

Pokémon the Series: Diamond and Pearl

Ash arriving in Sinnoh
Following Ash's victory over the Battle Frontier, May set her sights on Pokémon Contests in the Johto region and traveled there while Max returned home to Petalburg City in Hoenn. After encountering and battling his old rival, Gary (who has now become a Pokémon researcher), and learning of a new region with new Pokémon, Ash decided to leave for the Sinnoh region to earn the Gym Badges available there. Like before, he took only Pikachu with him at first but brought his Aipom along when she snuck onto the ship Ash was leaving on. While Brock did not directly accompany Ash to Sinnoh, he did meet with him while there and traveled with him through Sinnoh as he had for Kanto, Johto, and Hoenn. This time, they were accompanied by another aspiring Pokémon Coordinator named Dawn. Ash enthusiastically supported Dawn in her endeavors to become a Top Coordinator. Unlike May, he watched all of Dawn's Contests without being distracted by the need to train. Just as he supported Dawn in her Contests, she supported him in his Gym battles. She would even go as far as dressing up as a cheerleader with her Pokémon sometimes and cheer for him.

While traveling through Sinnoh, Ash formed a heated rivalry with a Trainer named Paul. Throughout Ash's journey, Paul would constantly put him down and the two often argued over their nearly opposite training styles. While Paul was harsh, distant, and sometimes plain cruel to his Pokémon, Ash insisted that the best way to raise Pokémon was through patience, caring, and friendship. Their rivalry came to a head after they competed in a Tag Battle Tournament together when Paul released his Chimchar after it failed to meet his expectations. Ash then decided to take in the Chimp Pokémon and promised to make it strong using his philosophy. Although Ash always considered himself on par with him, Paul would often come out the better in their battles as his Pokémon were very powerful, due to him only keeping Pokémon that were naturally really strong. Ash's Pokémon, though they grew under his command and became strong in their own right, could not yet equal those of Paul's. Later events would soon lead to a particularly crushing defeat at Lake Acuity for Ash, losing a Full Battle while only knocking out two of Paul's Pokémon in return, this being Ash's heaviest loss in any battle up to that point. Following the defeat, Ash acknowledged that he had to take Paul more seriously and cautiously in the future.


Ash in the Wallace Cup

Ash in the Hearthome Collection
While in Sinnoh, Ash competed in two official Pokémon Contests, once in Jubilife City and a second time in the Wallace Cup upon Wallace's recommendation. He also competed against several Pokémon Stylists in the Hearthome Collection fashion show in Arriving in Style!, where he ended up in third place, winning the Unique Award for his original performance.

As Ash and his friends journeyed through Sinnoh, they ended up becoming heavily involved with the legends of Sinnoh, with Ash being personally chosen by Azelf of the lake guardians. Along with Cynthia, Looker and Team Rocket, they faced off against Pokémon Hunter J as well as the evil Team Galactic. Thanks to their efforts, the Sinnoh region was spared from Cyrus's insane scheme.

Ash eventually obtained all of the Sinnoh Gym Badges he needed to enter Sinnoh's Pokémon League Conference. During his battles in the Lily of the Valley Conference, he managed to advance to the Top 4. For the second time since meeting Paul (the first being in a PokéRinger tournament during which Ash's Staravia evolved into a Staraptor and defeated Paul's Honchkrow), Ash managed to defeat his bitter rival, notably using Paul's discarded Chimchar, now an Infernape, to deal the finishing blow. This confirmed Ash's beliefs in how to raise Pokémon, showing that though he took his time and raised his Pokémon with care and friendship they achieved the same results as Paul's methods. This caused Paul to finally acknowledge Ash as a Trainer of some merit, thus ending their arguments. Ash later fought against Tobias, becoming the only known Trainer to defeat his Darkrai. Although Ash ultimately lost the battle at the same magnitude as his loss to Paul at Lake Acuity, he was not overly upset as he was closer to his Pokémon than ever before. After Pokémon the Series: Diamond and Pearl, Ash, Dawn, and Brock split up and went their separate ways, with Brock confirming that he would not be joining Ash on his later travels as he decided to pursue his new dream of being a Pokémon doctor.


Pokémon the Series: Black & White

Ash with Iris and Cilan
Shortly after returning home from his Sinnoh journey, Ash traveled with Delia and Professor Oak on a trip to the Unova region. After losing in a battle to Trip and seeing the power of the Legendary Pokémon Zekrom, Ash became interested in traveling to Unova to meet new Pokémon, as well as new friends. In Unova, he brought along only his Pikachu as he did in Hoenn.

Soon after he started his journey, Ash met Iris, a wild girl who is (as he later learns) a possible successor of the Opelucid Gym and wishes to be a Dragon Master, and Cilan, one of the Striaton Gym Leaders, who aspires to be the world's greatest Pokémon Connoisseur. After Ash earns their interest by telling Iris of his encounter with Zekrom and battling Cilan for the Trio Badge, the three decide to travel together. During his time in Unova, along with his quest for the Badges, the three friends also competed in the local competitions Club Battle, Clubsplosion, and Pokémon World Tournament Junior Cup. Despite battling quite well, Ash failed to win any of the tournaments and managed to be the runner-up of two of the three. Despite these mishaps, he was not upset to see his friends win the competitions instead of him.

As they journeyed, Ash and his friends ended up again being caught up in Team Rocket's new plot, which was personally being supervised by Giovanni. This time, Team Rocket planned to take over the world using a Meloetta that Ash befriended to unleash the power of the Forces of Nature. Thanks to Cynthia and Ridley, Ash and his friends managed to thwart Team Rocket's evil plot.

After managing to obtain eight Unova Gym Badges, Ash was allowed to participate in the Vertress Conference along with his current and some new rivals. In the preliminary round, Ash battled Trip one-on-one, defeating him for the first time and ending their rivalry. Ash also defeated his friend and rival, Stephan, in the tournament. He then battled one of his newer rivals, Cameron, where he lost in A Unova League Evolution!, ending in the Top 8 of the Vertress Conference.

After the Conference, the three friends decided to check out some ruins that Professor Juniper's father, Cedric Juniper discovered, and on the way, they met with a strange young man named N. They soon became entwined in the plots of Ghetsis, Colress, and Team Plasma as they sought to take over the world using Reshiram's power. Ash and his friends, along with Looker, the Team Rocket trio, Professor Cedric, as well as N, Anthea and Concordia, managed to foil Plasma's evil scheme.

As their adventures started coming to a close, Ash and his friends decided to take the long way back to Kanto by sailing on a series of luxury liners through a chain of islands called the Decolore Islands. On the way, Ash met Alexa, a Pokémon Journalist, from whom he learned of the Kalos region. Soon after they reach Kanto, Ash split up with Iris and Cilan, who wished to go in separate directions to follow their dreams.

Pokémon the Series: XY

Ash as a Baron at the Battle Chateau
After his brief visit to Pallet Town and having left his Pokémon in Professor Oak's care beside Pikachu, Ash arrived at the Kalos region with Alexa, first visiting Lumiose City, where he parted ways with the journalist and tried to challenge the Lumiose Gym at Prism Tower. He was forcibly ejected from the tower when the computerized security system, later revealed to be the Clembot, found out that he didn't have any Kalos Badges. He was rescued by Clemont and Bonnie.

Ash brought an injured Froakie to Professor Sycamore, who told Ash about an additional stage of Pokémon evolution he was researching called Mega Evolution. Assisted by Pikachu and Froakie, Ash calmed down an angry Garchomp belonging to Sycamore that was attacking Lumiose City. Ash saw a Mega Evolved Pokémon for the first time when a Mega Blaziken saved him and Pikachu from falling off of Prism Tower. Froakie then allowed itself to be captured by Ash, and Clemont and Bonnie started to travel with Ash.

Ash won his first Kalos Badge, the Bug Badge, after defeating the Santalune Gym Leader, Viola. The group was joined by Serena, who still remembered Ash rescuing her in her childhood and decided to start her journey to reunite with him, although he initially did not remember the two of them meeting. Ash and Serena learn that Clemont was the Lumiose Gym Leader, who was exiled from his Gym by his invention. They help Clemont face Clembot, and after the issue was resolved, the two boys promised to battle after Ash fulfilled the original conditions set by Clembot (even if it was no longer necessary), to earn four Badges. With that, the group set off on their journey again. During their travels, they occasionally met the ninja boy Sanpei, whose presence always led to progress in Froakie's (and later Frogadier's and Greninja's) strength.

Ash briefly traveled with the Shalour Gym Leader Korrina to discover more about Mega Evolution and Mega Stones.


Ash with Serena, Clemont, and Bonnie
Ash and his friends later attended Professor Sycamore's Pokémon Summer Camp, where they met the trio of Shauna, Tierno, and Trevor, with whom the group started a friendly rivalry with. In Ash's case, his rivalry would mainly be with Trevor and Tierno as Serena and Shauna pursued Pokémon Showcases.

During their journey, Ash caught a lost and traumatized Goomy, which he raised into a Sliggoo, and later, a powerful Goodra. After earning his fourth Gym Badge, Ash eventually faced Clemont in their promised Gym Battle, and won with Goodra's help, gaining his fifth Badge. Later, Ash and friends came across Goodra's old home, where they discovered it was taken over by a Florges and her companions. After saving Goodra's swamp from Team Rocket while simultaneously solving the issue concerning Florges, Ash left Goodra in the wetlands so it could act as the protector of its swamp and the Pokémon living in it. Some time afterward, when Ash reached Laverre City to challenge the Gym, he made a new rival in Sawyer, a novice trainer hailing from Hoenn. Along the way, Ash also supported Serena in her quest to become Kalos Queen and gave her some helpful advice when she eventually lost, telling her that losing is simply another step towards victory.

Later in their journeys, Ash and friends reached Anistar City and, together with Professor Sycamore, they met the Gym Leader, Olympia. She revealed his Frogadier's past as a Froakie from before meeting Ash and a glimpse of Frogadier's, his friend's, Sycamore's, Team Rocket's, and his fate, indicating that they would all play a vital role in Kalos's future. Ash challenged her to a Double Battle, which he won using Frogadier and Talonflame.

Shortly after, the group came across a mysterious Pokémon, dubbed Squishy by Bonnie, who was being pursued relentlessly by the villainous team Team Flare, prompting the group to put it under their protective custody. Some time afterward, Ash and his friends got involved in a conflict in Sanpei's hometown, which led to Frogadier evolving into Greninja, as well as achieving Bond Phenomenon for the first time. During another confrontation with Team Flare in Terminus Cave, Ash learned Bond Phenomenon came at a cost, as he was able to share Greninja's senses, but also share its pain.


Ash and Greninja activating the Bond Phenomenon
Later on, Ash met up with Alain, who became intrigued by Greninja's Bond Phenomenon and requested to battle Ash. Ash put up a decent fight but eventually lost. After his loss against Alain, Ash and Greninja began training to perfect Greninja's new form. Ash and Greninja later had a rematch with Alain and a battle against Diantha, during the latter Greninja even managed to reach its final Ash-Greninja form. Despite their training, the two were unsuccessful in mastering the transformation as Ash passed out during both battles from exhaustion from using the form.

After losing a rematch with Sawyer, in which Greninja even failed to transform, Ash began feeling doubtful of his ability to master the transformation. His confidence was shaken further after brutally losing to the Snowbelle Gym Leader Wulfric in a battle where all three of his Pokémon were unable to bring down Wulfric's second Pokémon, Avalugg. After seeing how badly Greninja got hurt during their battle and blaming himself for the loss, a depressed Ash left into the Winding Woods by himself. After an argument with Serena, Ash was able to get back to his old self. He later met up with Greninja, and while trying to save a wild Spewpa, the two were able to perfect Bond Phenomenon. With Greninja's Ash-Greninja form perfected, Ash was able to defeat Wulfric in a rematch, earning him his final Kalos Gym Badge and qualifying him for participation in the Lumiose Conference.

After returning to Lumiose City, Ash entered the Lumiose Conference. Following several notable victories, Ash had Goodra rejoin his team for his semi-final battle against Sawyer. After a narrow victory, Ash managed to defeat Sawyer and reach the finals of the Conference, marking his first appearance in the finals of a Pokémon League; where he would face Alain. On the night before the final battle, he and his friends learned more about the Ash-Greninja transformation. In the finals of the Lumiose Conference, Ash and Alain started a back-and-forth battle that eventually came down to Alain's Mega Charizard X against Ash's Greninja in its Ash-Greninja form. After a fierce battle, Greninja was defeated, causing Ash to end up as the Runner-Up of the Lumiose Conference. Ash showed great sincerity and principle following the battle, shaking Alain's hand regardless of the result.


Ash and his Pokémon captured by Team Flare
During the closing ceremony of the conference, Team Flare began their final operation, using the power of the blue Zygarde Core Z2 to cause massive roots to destroy parts of Lumiose City. Ash and his Pokémon were ultimately abducted by Team Flare and were taken captive at the top of Prism Tower, as Lysandre intended to use Ash and Greninja's Bond Phenomenon for his plans by using Team Flare's Mega Evolution energy ray to control them. However, upon hearing Pikachu's voice, Ash resisted the machine's influence, even getting Greninja to do the same thing. After talking some sense into Alain, Ash and Greninja broke free from their bindings by using the Bond Phenomenon. Ash and Alain soon engaged in a battle against Lysandre and ultimately managed to defeat him. When Ash later heard about the Giant Rock, he met up with the rest to combat it. Thanks to everyone's combined effort, Chespie was saved from the Giant Rock. Squishy and Z2 ultimately destroyed the creature, before the two Zygarde left.

Following the crisis, Ash helped Alain and Serena resolve their issues and bid farewell to his rivals. Later, after dropping Goodra off at the wetlands again, the group came across Xerosic, one of Team Flare's Scientists. Ash, his Greninja, his friends and the gang were ultimately able to foil Xerosic's plans and hand him over to Officer Jenny. The group soon reunited with Squishy and Z2, who requested Greninja's help to obliterate the remaining negative energy left by Team Flare's crisis. Knowing this was for the sake of Kalos, Ash bade farewell to Greninja before Greninja left with the two Zygarde. After releasing Greninja, Ash and the gang headed back to Lumiose City to say their final goodbyes. After bidding farewell to Serena, who headed for Hoenn, Ash separated from Clemont and Bonnie as well and returned to Pallet Town.

Pokémon the Series: Sun & Moon

Ash and his classmates
Ash traveled with Delia to the Alola region after Mimey won the trip via lottery. It was shown that Ash gave his Kalos Pokémon to Professor Oak, who gave him and his mother a Pokémon Egg to deliver to his cousin Samson. While on Melemele Island, Ash stumbled upon the Pokémon School, where he met Lana, Lillie, Mallow, Kiawe, Sophocles, Samson, and Professor Kukui and learned about Z-Rings and Z-Moves. Later on, he met Tapu Koko, the guardian of Melemele Island, who gave Ash a Z-Ring and an Electrium Z. With these discoveries, Ash decided to remain in Alola to study at the school and learn more about Z-Moves, living with Professor Kukui.

Later, Tapu Koko challenged Ash and Pikachu to a battle. Ash's Electrium Z broke after Ash and Pikachu used the Z-Move Gigavolt Havoc on Tapu Koko. Ash then decided to take on the island challenge to obtain new Z-Crystals and prove his worth.


Ash and his Z-Ring
Ash caught several Pokémon on Melemele Island, such as his Rowlet, Rockruff, and Litten. Ash also got a Normalium Z after his fight with Totem Gumshoos on Melemele Island. Tapu Koko gave him a new Electrium Z after Ash won his grand trial battle with Melemele Island kahuna Hala. Also, Ash struck up a friendly rivalry with Lillie's brother Gladion. He then gained a Grassium Z and Rockium Z during his trial and grand trial on Akala Island. He also briefly reunited with Brock, Misty, and some of his Pokémon during a field trip to Kanto for an extracurricular activity.

One day, Ash was entrusted to take care of a Cosmog by Solgaleo and Lunala, which he saw in a dream. The Cosmog, nicknamed Nebby by Lillie, took a liking to Ash and frequently caused trouble with its ability to teleport people around. In Faba's Revenge!, Faba kidnapped Nebby while Ash's attention was elsewhere. When Ash and Lillie learned about this, they enlisted Gladion and Lusamine in helping them rescue it. When the four found Faba, they also found that he successfully forced Nebby to summon a Nihilego from an Ultra Wormhole. After Nihilego kidnapped Lusamine and retreated into the Ultra Wormhole, Ash discovered that the incident caused Nebby to evolve into a Cosmoem.

Ash, his classmates, and Gladion then watched as the guardian deities helped Nebby evolve into the Legendary Pokémon Solgaleo and upgrade Ash's Z-Ring into a Z-Power Ring. With a Solganium Z he received from Nebby, Ash activated Solgaleo's Z-Move, Searing Sunraze Smash, and had Nebby open up an Ultra Wormhole, allowing everyone to traverse through Ultra Space on Nebby's back. There, after Ash's Electrium Z temporarily transformed into a Pikashunium Z, Ash and Pikachu used it to launch a 10,000,000 Volt Thunderbolt. The attack defeated Nihilego, weakening it long enough for Lillie and Gladion to pull their mother free from its hold. The Pikashunium Z then reverted to an Electrium Z. With their mission finished, Lusamine was taken back through the Ultra Wormhole to the Altar of the Sunne.

During Kukui and Burnet's wedding reception in the aftermath of the incident, Ash and his friends were invited to join an Ultra Beast response task force, known as the Ultra Guardians, which they all agreed to. On their first mission, Ash and his classmates were assigned to capture a Buzzwole that had appeared through an Ultra Wormhole. The Ultra Guardians encountered it at Mahalo Trail, where Ash eventually realized it preferred flexing to battling. As a result, Ash and Kiawe distracted it long enough for the former to throw a Beast Ball at it, successfully capturing it. Later, Buzzwole was brought to Melemele Meadow, where Professor Burnet temporarily opened a new wormhole, allowing Buzzwole to return home.


Ash in his Ultra Guardian uniform
Later, Ash encountered a Poipole who seemed strangely attached to Pikachu. After a while, Poipole was confirmed to be an Ultra Beast. Ash was permitted to capture it, though he failed several times as Poipole thought the catching process was a game. After Ash helped it understand what was happening, Poipole allowed itself to be captured and was allowed to stay with the group until they could find its Ultra Wormhole and send it back.

Ash attempted to participate in the Ula'ula Island challenge, but he was rejected by Nanu and lost in an impromptu "pre-trial". Afterward, Ash decided to stay on the island and train under Tapu Bulu. This allowed him to formally participate in his island challenge, which turned out to be a battle against Jessie's Mimikyu, who recently gained a Mimikium Z. Ash barely won thanks to Pikachu learning Electroweb, as well as being able to once again use 10,000,000 Volt Thunderbolt. Finally, Ash participated in the grand trial, where he faced off against Nanu in a 3-on-1 battle in Nanu's favor and won, earning himself a Lycanium Z.

Ash led the Ultra Guardians' investigation into mysterious dark clouds that appeared over the Alola region, causing all of the adults in Alola to lose their energy and motivation. The cause was revealed to be a Necrozma pursuing a Lunala, which resulted in a massive battle against Necrozma. During this time, Nebby joined the fight; Necrozma possessed Lunala and then Nebby to become Dawn Wings and Dusk Mane Necrozma, respectively; and the Ultra Guardians pursued Necrozma into Poipole's world. There, they learned about how Necrozma needed to regain its true form to release Nebby. After Ash and Gladion acquired Z-Crystals for Nebby and Lunala, the Ultra Guardians, with the help of their Pokémon, Lunala, Poipole's friends, and everyone else in Alola, shared their Z-Power with Necrozma, causing it to release Nebby. Afterward, Ash and Nebby used Searing Sunraze Smash, while Gladion and Lunala used Menacing Moonraze Maelstrom on Necrozma. The combined Z-Moves fully restored Necrozma's light, giving it the strength to become its true form, Ultra Necrozma. Afterward, the Ultra Guardians, Nebby, and Lunala traveled back to Alola through the Ultra Wormhole, while Ash said farewell to Poipole, who chose to stay behind in its world.

Later, Ash and his classmates arrived on Poni Island for their research projects for school. Ash's project was to have a grand trial battle. In A Grand Debut!, Ash battled the newly appointed island kahuna Hapu in a one-on-one battle and won. Letting Pikachu choose their reward for the completion, Ash received a Steelium Z.


Ash after winning the Manalo Conference
Following this victory, Ash entered the first-ever Manalo Conference, along with his classmates. He eventually made it to the semifinals, where he faced off against the Team Skull Boss Guzma. After a tough match, Ash was able to defeat him and advance to the finals, where he was set to face Gladion. On the night before the final battle, Ash's Meltan fused with its fellow Meltan, evolving into Melmetal, which Ash ended up using as his first Pokémon in the finals. The match eventually resulted in a battle between the two Trainers' Lycanroc, with Ash's Lycanroc eventually emerging victorious, thus earning Ash the title of Alola League Champion.

After winning the Alola League championship, Ash was given the right to have an exhibition match against the Masked Royal. However, during a Guzzlord invasion of the Manalo Stadium, the Masked Royal's true identity as Professor Kukui was exposed. With his cover blown, Kukui decided to battle Ash as himself and make the exhibition match a Full Battle, which Ash agreed to. During the battle, Ash's Torracat was finally able to defeat its longtime rival, Professor Kukui's Incineroar, and evolve into an Incineroar itself. Before Kukui could send out his last Pokémon, Tapu Koko appeared and took its place in the battle. When Ash was down to his last Pokémon, Pikachu, Tapu Koko gave Kukui a Tapunium Z, while Ash's Electrium Z once again transformed into a Pikashunium Z, allowing both Pokémon to unleash their signature Z-Moves. In the end, Ash's Pikachu's Z-Move proved superior and defeated Tapu Koko, ending the exhibition match with Ash's victory.

After the Manalo Conference had ended, Ash was left unsure of what to do next. However, after hearing Olivia mention how important knowing the "outside world" is, he decided to return home and start traveling around the world. After saying farewell to his classmates, Kukui, and Burnet, he boarded a plane back to Kanto, leaving all of his current party Pokémon (excluding Pikachu) under the two Professors' care.

Pokémon Journeys: The Series

Ash's goal of battling Monarch Leon
Sometime after his return to Kanto, Ash joined Professor Oak in attending the opening of the new Cerise Laboratory in Vermilion City. During the opening ceremony, the head of the lab, Professor Cerise, informed the attendees that a rare Pokémon would be appearing at the local port shortly. Ash eagerly rushed over there and found out the rare Pokémon was a Lugia. During this encounter, he also met a boy named Goh, and the two shared a ride with Lugia throughout Kanto. When they later returned to the Cerise Laboratory, Professor Cerise was amazed by the information they had gathered about Lugia, and he asked them to become his research assistants. They accepted the offer and were provided with their room to stay in. Delia also left Mimey at the lab to take care of Ash while he stayed there.

Later, Ash and Goh traveled to the Galar region to watch the finals of the World Coronation Series. The match ended in the victory of Galar's undefeated Champion Leon, thus making him the Monarch, the official strongest Trainer in the world. Inspired by this, Ash decided he wanted to battle Leon himself. However, before he could challenge him, a Gigantamax Drednaw went on a rampage and started causing havoc. While Ash and Goh battled it, Pikachu ended up Gigantamaxing as well, therefore giving him enough power to defeat Drednaw. Leon, impressed by Ash's performance, accepted his challenge to a battle. Ash also received a Dynamax Band from Leon. After Ash lost, he decided to take part in the World Coronation Series as well and climb through its ranks to one day challenge Leon again.

Upon entering the World Coronation Series, Ash immediately started building up a winning streak, soon even reaching the Great Class after defeating Korrina. Ash's winning streak came to an end, however, when he encountered Bea, a Fighting-type Gym Leader from Galar, who was also aiming to defeat Leon. In their two-on-two match at the Fighting Dojo, Ash failed to defeat a single one of Bea's Pokémon, with her powerful Grapploct with its many limbs and Octolock proving especially troublesome. This crushing defeat caused Ash to start losing his self-confidence and led to him entering a losing streak, even resulting in him falling back into the Normal Class. This caused him to get depressed, until he was snapped back into his senses by a motivational speech from Goh. Thanks to this, he quickly fought his way back into the Great Class and challenged Bea to a rematch at the Cianwood Gym, managing to tie with her this time.

One night, Ash's Dynamax Band began to glow. After learning about cases of Pokémon Dynamaxing in Galar outside of Power Spots, Ash and Goh headed there to investigate. Soon after arriving in the region, Ash and Goh ended up getting separated while in the Slumbering Weald, where Ash encountered Zacian, whereas Goh encountered Zamazenta. Later, Ash encountered Leon and joined him in taking care of the Dynamax Pokémon rampaging around Galar. During this quest, they ended up encountering Chairman Rose and Oleana, and Ash accompanied them to dine and spend a night at Rose Tower. When he departed the next day to rendezvous with Goh, Eternatus emerged from the Hammerlocke Energy Plant, starting the Darkest Day and prompting Ash to head there. At the Hammerlocke Stadium, Ash re-encountered Rose and engaged him in a battle, eventually winning thanks to his newly evolved Lucario. Reuniting with Goh, the two then engaged in a battle against Eternatus, after Leon had failed to stop it. With Zacian and Zamazenta's help, they successfully defeated Eternatus and sealed it away, ending the Darkest Day.


Ash with Dawn, Goh, and Chloe
Following his second battle with Bea, Ash entered another winning streak, steadily increasing his ranking. One day, he received a letter from Iris, challenging him to a World Coronation Series battle. He happily accepted her invitation, but was later surprised to find out that Iris had succeeded Alder as the new Champion of Unova. After an intense battle, Ash defeated his former traveling companion and rose to the Ultra Class as a result. In his first Ultra Class battle, Ash was pitted against Volkner and succeeded in defeating him. Following the match, Volkner informed Ash that Cynthia was taking part in the World Coronation Series as well, and had managed to climb her way into the Master Class.

Knowing that he was going to be facing very strong opponents in the Ultra and Master Classes, Ash sought Korrina's help to Mega Evolve his Lucario. After receiving a Mega Glove from Korrina, Ash traveled to Mega Island and managed to obtain himself a Lucarionite, just in time to receive a message informing him that Bea was to be his next Ultra Class opponent. As such, Ash then traveled to Stow-on-Side to settle his score with Bea once and for all on her home turf. Using his newly acquired Mega Lucario, Ash was able to defeat Bea's Gigantamax Machamp, finally earning him a victory against his rival.

After defeating Bea, Ash sought Allister's help in Gigantamaxing his Gengar. Thanks to the Max Soup made by him, Gengar was able to unlock its Gigantamax potential, which proved useful in Ash's World Coronation Series battle against Marnie.

His victories kept bringing Ash more and more fame as the rising star of Kanto, causing the news of his next Ultra Class battle, this one against Drasna of the Kalos Elite Four, to gain widespread media attention. Following a reunion and a training session with Clemont and Bonnie, Ash took on Drasna and defeated her, putting him at the very top of the Ultra Class. As such, his next match was to be an entrance battle against Raihan, the lowest-ranked Trainer in the Master Class. After briefly reuniting with Greninja in Kalos and having his Lucario train its Aura with it, Ash felt ready for the match. Raihan, Leon's long-time rival, gave Ash a very tough challenge, even forcing him to use Gengar's Gigantamax instead of Lucario's Mega Evolution to bypass his weather strategy. Eventually, however, Ash managed to win, officially putting him in the Master Class along with the other reigning regional Champions and Alain.


Ash wearing his Z-Power Ring, Dynamax Band, and Mega Glove
During a visit to the Crown Tundra, Ash reunited with Lillie and her family just as they succeeded in finding Lillie's missing father, Mohn. He then proceeded to accompany them back to Alola, where he reunited with his Alolan family and friends. Ash also participated in a special Battle Royal that was organized to celebrate the homecoming of the Alola Champion. During the Battle Royal, the entire Alola region showed their support for Ash and encouraged him to win the Masters Eight Tournament as Alola's representative.

After some hard training with his Pokémon kept at Professor Oak's lab and Paul, Ash traveled to Galar once more to participate in the Masters Eight Tournament, along with the rest of the Masters Eight, reuniting with Iris, Alain, and the other regional Champions. His first opponent was chosen to be Steven. After watching the other quarterfinal battles, Ash and Steven began their battle. Although he had a tough time against the Hoenn Champion, Ash was eventually able to defeat him with the help of 10,000,000 Volt Thunderbolt, advancing him to the semifinals to face Cynthia. After witnessing Leon rather easily defeat Diantha, Ash took on Cynthia. Although Cynthia gained an early lead, Ash gradually evened the odds, until his Mega Lucario finally took home the victory, meaning that Ash and Leon's long-awaited battle was to finally happen.


Ash after becoming the new Monarch
At the start of the finals, Leon surprised everyone by allowing Ash to use all three of Mega Evolution, Dynamax, and Z-Moves during the battle, which Ash accepted. During the climax of the battle, Eternatus appeared above Wyndon Stadium and granted both Trainers an additional use of Dynamax. The climactic showdown ended with a clash between Ash's Pikachu and Leon's Charizard. Ultimately, Ash's partner emerged victorious against the undefeated Charizard, fulfilling Ash's dream of defeating Leon and making him the new Monarch.

Following the Masters Eight Tournament, Ash announced his intentions to set off on a new journey alone to continue learning more about Pokémon and achieve his goal of becoming a Pokémon Master. After departing from the Cerise Laboratory, Ash parted ways with Goh, who wished to go his way to achieve his dream.


Ash resuming his journey with Pikachu
Shortly after parting ways with Goh, Ash met an injured wild Latias. He helped to treat her injuries and protected her from being stolen by Team Rocket. As a result, she started to secretly follow him. Soon after, Ash reunited with Misty and Brock, who joined him in his travels once more as they continued to help out Pokémon in need and reunite with Ash's other old friends like Cilan, the Squirtle Squad, and his Lapras. Latias eventually reappeared before Ash and requested his help in saving a Latios from a Pokémon hunter. Once the hunter had been stopped, Latias left with Latios, who stubbornly didn't trust humans yet. He decided to return to Pallet Town following this, with Brock and Misty also deciding to return to their respective hometowns, although not before expressing a desire to travel again in the future. After returning home, Ash reunited with Tracey and his Pidgeot, the latter of whom returned to his party. During an encounter with Gary, he was asked how close he was to becoming a Pokémon Master now that he had become the Monarch. After spending a while pondering the answer, Ash deduced that to him, a Pokémon Master is a person who can befriend any Pokémon. Since he had failed to befriend Latios despite helping him, he figured he still had to work more to achieve his dream. As such, he resolved to resume traveling and left Pallet Town with Pikachu once more.


Character

Ash and his mother
Ash is an only child who lived with his mother Delia until he left for his Pokémon journey at the age of ten. His main goal in life, as described in the first episode, is to be the world's greatest Pokémon Master. One particular characteristic about Ash that has not changed throughout the anime, aside from his determination and his passion for raising and training Pokémon, is that he is incredibly selfless. He will often go to extraordinary lengths to earn a Pokémon's trust and respect and to better understand a Pokémon that he sees as troubled. He is also very fair-minded and trusting, a true testament to his good-natured character.

Ash has a strong sense of justice, especially when it comes to Pokémon. If a Pokémon is in trouble, he will make every effort to help them, even if he has no prior connection to them. If they are the cause of trouble, he will stop them, and then try to understand them, with almost all such occasions being a case of the Pokémon, or their Trainers or friends, having a problem which can't be resolved normally. In those cases, he will selflessly volunteer to help them. As shown on several occasions, such as in Lumiose City Pursuit! and The Road Most Traveled!, he is even willing to put his own life in danger to help Pokémon. Should the problem be caused by humans, such as Team Rocket, Pokémon thieves, hunters, or poachers, Ash will resolve to do anything in his power to stop them.

Despite this and previous dealings with villainous teams, Ash has retained a remarkably optimistic and naive outlook, a trait his companions seem to share. He is quick to praise and has an unshakable trust in both his Pokémon and his friends. Also, Ash is determined to see the best in everybody unless he has a very good reason not to. An example would be Team Rocket's frequent "sudden appearances" that coincide with their needs at that time, and Ash never questioning it until it is too late. Another example would be how he always praises Clemont for his inventions, no matter their high failure rate, and the near-inevitable explosion, or Cilan for his various hobbies. Furthermore, even though almost all of his friends have large dreams, Ash fully supports them and has never doubted their ability to accomplish them, possibly due to his own highly ambitious goal. He also encourages Pokémon to do the best they can, even if they aren't his own, and has even helped train wild Pokémon.

In the original series, though Ash actively took part in battles, he was rarely seen independently training his Pokémon. However, since Pokémon the Series: Ruby and Sapphire, Ash is shown training more noticeably, having practice battles with his friends and focusing on moves, techniques, and strategies with his Pokémon. A noticeable trait of Ash's is his willingness to learn from both his victories and defeats. For example, after winning in a Gym battle against Winona in Sky High Gym Battle! and witnessing her Pokémon's powerful Aerial Ace, Ash was motivated to have his Swellow learn it. Even his losses can inspire him, such as when he lost to Clayton in Short and To the Punch! and decided to teach his Buizel one of the moves Clayton's Mr. Mime had used during their battle. He believes nothing he and his Pokémon do on their journey is a waste of time.

In the beginning of the anime, Ash had a bit of an inferiority complex, as well as some form of personal pride, most likely stemming from his rivalry with Gary. As a result, he had some bad habits, such as shamelessly boasting of his skill if he were ever on a winning streak, and becoming angered easily if he were personally insulted, as seen in The Path to the Pokémon League. Ash used to complain about perfectly legal things, like Giselle's Cubone using a bone in The School of Hard Knocks, or Blaine's use of the lava in Volcanic Panic. He even locked himself up in his room and sulked after losing to Ritchie, although this anger was not entirely unfounded as the loss came as a result of both his Charizard's disobedience and Team Rocket wearing out his other Pokémon before the match began. He overcame his disappointment after seeing and listening to how Ritchie took his loss as a way to better himself as a Trainer in Friends to the End. Fortunately, during his journey, Ash has gotten over this particular character trait and is now more accepting of criticism of his skill, though he still gets upset if his Pokémon are insulted or degraded.


Ash and Paul
Perhaps one of Ash's greatest rivalries was against Paul during his time in the Sinnoh region. On the contrary of Ash, who strongly believed in the bond between Trainer and Pokémon, Paul's only concern was with a Pokémon's strength, believing that bonding only caused them to become spoiled and unmotivated. Due to this, aside from winning the Sinnoh League, Ash's biggest goal during his Sinnoh travels was to ultimately change Paul's mindset and have the latter finally acknowledge him as a Trainer worthy of his attention. After a long and exhausting journey, he finally managed to accomplish this after defeating Paul at the Lily of the Valley Conference, after which Paul finally recognized Ash as his rival and equal.

In most episodes of the anime, especially those during the Johto League arc, Ash befriends someone who will influence him and cause him to strive to become a better Trainer. Although he is not a dependent individual, he is still young and has learned to make his way relying on his friends, particularly the maternal skills of Brock. The honor of "best friend" is usually reserved for Pikachu, but Ash has come to see his closest human friends in the same light over time; using the term for Misty and Brock in Gotta Catch Ya Later! as well as May and Max in Battling the Enemy Within.

Ash has changed a great deal throughout the anime, particularly regarding his skill at Pokémon training, but his earnestness, rashness, and determination have remained. Never straying from his goal, he has remained loyal to his friends, family, and supporters, but most of all his Pokémon. Ash became a great Trainer by learning to find and use the inner strength of each of his Pokémon by bonding with them. For example, when he received a banner filled with prints from his Pokémon in The Unbeatable Lightness of Seeing!, he knew which Pokémon placed specific prints, showing his close bond with them. He also learns where their hidden abilities lie, as well as resorting to unorthodox strategies when fighting particularly challenging opponents. For example, he uses his Pikachu's speed to outmaneuver larger foes and attack. In another instance, his Charizard defeated Gary's Blastoise by causing the field to overheat before mounting a close-quarters attack while Blastoise was blinded by the steam. He also prefers to train a Pokémon to be the best it can be without forcing it to evolve, as evidenced by his treatment of Gligar in Fighting Fear With Fear!. He is happy when his Pokémon evolve but lets them choose whether or not they want to evolve instead of forcing them.


Ash after catching a Pokémon
Physically, Ash is in very good shape, especially for someone 10 years of age. He has a lot of stamina, walking miles upon miles through all kinds of environments while journeying between towns on his journey. He also has huge endurance, as seen when he took powerful attacks from various Pokémon head-on and then recovering quite quickly. Furthermore, Ash has demonstrated himself to be a bit acrobatic, occasionally being able to keep up with Iris, who virtually grew up swinging and jumping through treetops. Ash has occasionally displayed great reflexes, being able to dodge attacks or catch falling objects out of the blue, and even being able to save himself, or others, in the last second during perilous situations. What's more, Ash has exhibited tremendous willpower, as seen when he took attacks for long periods and keeps advancing, which also drives his "never give up" attitude when it comes to Pokémon battles. He is also strong, being capable of picking up heavy Pokémon such as Larvitar and Hippopotas.

Ash is also quite dense when it comes to matters of the field of romance. Throughout the anime, Ash has only displayed open interest in a female only once, and nothing came out of it. Though some girls in the anime have shown obvious (and subtle) affection towards him, Ash meets it with nearly unfailing obtuseness, which some characters have also noticed. Even when it involves other people's romance, Ash is usually oblivious until someone points it out to him. Also, on a few occasions when it came to a matter of Pokémon love, with a male who's experiencing difficulty in gaining the attention of a female, while his friends will often mainly advise on improving the male's looks or charm, Ash's advice is simply to be stronger. Despite this, however, it is shown on several occasions that Ash does seem to understand the concept of marriage, most notably in The Professors' New Adventure, when he got excited by the news of Professor Kukui and Professor Burnet's engagement, and subsequently worked with his classmates to organize a big wedding ceremony for them.

Early on, Ash originally trained not to further himself but instead to catch more Pokémon than Gary, a feat that he never accomplished. Ash later slowed his pace, which allowed him to focus on the individual traits of each Pokémon. At the Silver Conference, with great humility and maturity, Ash finally won a battle against his old rival, signifying a great milestone in his history as a Trainer. His maturity has also increased in his dealings with Pokémon. This was shown when a Mankey stole his hat in Primeape Goes Bananas, he screamed and yelled at it, even climbing trees just to get his hat back, but when an Aipom did the same in Slaking Kong, he stated merely that he would feel strange without a hat. When Aipom stole his hat again on several future occasions, however, while she was under his ownership, he chased after her in the same manner as before, most likely out of exasperation that she still hadn't learned her lesson.

Ash has traversed much of the Pokémon world and has thus far participated in various Pokémon League Conferences, but he is still learning new things about Pokémon all the time. He has also gained a close connection with many Legendary and Mythical Pokémon, such as the ones who played major roles in the movies. In the English dub second movie, he was revealed to be "The Chosen One" - the one who would bring balance back to the world when it was disrupted.


Ash using Aura inside the Tree of Beginning
Ash possesses some special abilities as he has the rare ability to use Aura. He is said to have the same Aura as Sir Aaron, a legendary hero, and is theoretically able to manipulate it in much the same way. Therefore, he made a connection with Sir Aaron's Lucario. However, he has not received any training in this field, opting to continue his Pokémon journey instead. He has also been likened to an ancient Aura guardian in The Keystone Pops!, who also had a partner Pikachu. Later, in Pokémon Ranger and the Kidnapped Riolu! Part 1 and Part 2, Ash uses Aura again to locate a lost Riolu and read its mind as well. This time, however, he merely senses the Aura, rather than manipulating it. In Caring for a Mystery!, an unhatched Riolu reacted to Ash's Aura, and he was able to sense the Egg's response, leading him to it. Ash also has the unique ability to use Bond Phenomenon. After he obtained a Key Stone, Ash's Aura powers were enhanced significantly, allowing him and his Lucario to sense each other from a great distance away. After training with Greninja, Ash, and Lucario were able to synchronize their Auras even better, allowing Lucario to make its Aura Sphere grow into massive proportions by drawing power from the Auras of its allies.

Though his passion remains in battling, Ash is always eager to try new things, especially if he can do them together with his Pokémon, having participated in other events like Pokémon Contests, PokéRinger tournaments, and even a fashion show and a cosplay convention as well as various other Pokémon competitions. He has Contest Passes for Sinnoh and Hoenn. Ash carries with him half of a broken Poké Ball, while Gary Oak has the other half, as a symbol of their ongoing, but now friendly, rivalry; Misty's special lure, which she sent to him as a gift; and half of the Terracotta Medal he received after his Contest Battle with May in the unofficial Terracotta Contest ended in a tie.


Ash and his Alolan family
His father has not been introduced. The anime suggests that his father was once a Pokémon Trainer who began his journey in Pallet Town and that he is still living. In the original, he is also confirmed to have a grandfather, whose son followed his footsteps. An interview with the anime's storyboard artist Masamitsu Hidaka confirmed Ash's father is a Trainer on his own journey. According to Hidaka, Ash's father may or may not be introduced in the anime, depending on its necessity to further Ash's maturity and development as a Trainer. On the other hand, according to Takeshi Shudō's novelization, Ash's father left home to go on a journey right after Ash was born and never returned since. As he never registered his name in the Pokémon Trainer's list, his whereabouts are unknown. However, during his time in Alola, Ash's family expanded with Professor Kukui and Professor Burnet, as shown in The Shape of Love to Come!, when Mina was making a family portrait of them and agreed with Lana when she called the Professors his Alolan family. Ash also gets an Alolan brother in Professor Kukui and Professor Burnet's son, Lei, as seen in That New Old Gang of Mine!.

Once he gained the title of Champion in the Alola region, Ash became a local celebrity there, as seen in All Out, All of the Time! and Helping the Hometown Hero!. After becoming the World Coronation Series Monarch, Ash became a more recognized figure in other regions, as seen in A Squad's Worth of Passion!.

Pokémon

Some of the Pokémon Ash formerly traveled with (plus the Pink Butterfree)
As a Trainer, Ash has caught and befriended a sizable number of Pokémon throughout the anime. His philosophy on training is that Pokémon are individuals and that a combination of trust, friendship, and hard work are needed to overcome adversity. Several of Ash's Pokémon were caught because they allowed him to after he befriended them. He seems to battle best with Pokémon that are similar to Pikachu: ones that are speedy and maneuverable, yet able to perform high-powered attacks; however, he is willing to work with any Pokémon that comes into his care.

Ash's battle style is generally spontaneous and fairly unorthodox, and his Pokémon often reflect these traits. He often ignores type advantages and has been shown to use unusual strategies. For instance, during Pokémon the Series: Diamond and Pearl, he incorporated a twisting-spinning type maneuver in his Pokémon's offensive and defensive techniques, which eventually led to him creating the original technique, Counter Shield. Also, sometimes he will use someone else's battle strategies as shown with Paul and Tierno, though when using the latter's, Ash stated that his unique strategy is the one he can truly count on, instead of simply mimicking others.

Ash is very attached to his Pokémon and prefers to battle and train with them. Furthermore, he cares about their opinion, even giving them the option of whether they should evolve or not. As such, the majority of his Pokémon also share Ash's stubborn and reckless nature, persistently attempting to rise and continue the battle, even after receiving a great amount of damage and being at the end of their rope. However, if it is by their wish, or if he believes it is best for them, Ash will (if sometimes reluctantly) trade or release them, and in some cases, leave them with more experienced individuals so that they could train and get stronger. If Ash ever accidentally upsets his Pokémon, he will work hard to make amends and repair the bond with them.

Though Ash normally catches five or more Pokémon per region (not including when he traveled through the Orange Islands and challenged the Battle Frontier in his second tour of Kanto), he rarely ever switches the Pokémon in his current party with those in storage at Professor Oak's Laboratory. He usually only does so when battling against powerful opponents (such as Trainers in the Pokémon League Conferences, and Frontier Brains), or when attending certain events that require a specific Pokémon (like Tauros at the Pokémon Swap Meet or Snorlax at the Sumo Conference). However, during Pokémon the Series: Black & White, Ash actively cycled through the nine Pokémon he managed to catch in Unova, although these Pokémon when not in his party, were instead kept in storage at Professor Juniper's lab in Nuvema Town. Near the end of his journey in Unova, Professor Juniper transferred all of Ash's Pokémon to Professor Oak's lab. Ash did not use this system of training in the following series, though he did leave his Alolan party with Professors Kukui and Burnet at the end of Pokémon the Series: Sun & Moon.

Ash currently has ownership of 78 Pokémon, including all 30 of his Tauros. Including pre-evolved forms, traded, released, and given away Pokémon (and not including the additional Tauros), in total, Ash has currently officially owned a total of 98 different Pokémon species.

May:
-----------------------------------------
May is a Pokémon Coordinator from Petalburg City and a former traveling companion of Ash. She is the daughter of Norman and Caroline, and her first partner Pokémon was a Torchic given to her by Professor Birch.

Initially on a journey to meet new places, May found her true calling in Pokémon Contests and made it her goal to become a Top Coordinator. She traveled through Hoenn and Kanto with Ash, Brock, and her little brother, Max.
May grew up in Petalburg City in the Hoenn region with her parents, Caroline and Petalburg Gym Leader Norman, and brother, Max. As revealed in A Cacturne for the Worse, May, when she was younger, was playing in the water with some Tentacool, but found herself surrounded by a horde of them. However, when her parents saw this, Caroline tried to catch her because she had mistaken her for a Tentacool. Ever since that experience, May developed a dislike and fear of Pokémon.

Pokémon the Series: Ruby and Sapphire
Years later in Get the Show on the Road!, May was old enough to become a Pokémon Trainer, but she used it as an excuse just so she could travel, even though everyone expected her to follow in her father Norman's footsteps. However, after seeing a Pokémon Contest in All Things Bright and Beautifly!, she decided to become a Pokémon Coordinator instead. Since May initially knew almost nothing about Pokémon or attacks, Ash assumed the role of her mentor. She gradually gained experience through her journey and practice with Ash.

As a Coordinator, May was able to learn more about Pokémon and form stronger bonds with them. In Come What May!, after winning the Fallarbor Contest, May told her Beautifly that she loved it. This is an example of her growth — from someone who initially disliked Pokémon to someone who cared deeply for them.

With her Pokémon, May was able to come up with different attack combinations to use during her Contest Battles. For instance, she would use her Combusken's Fire Spin and her Squirtle's Bubble to create a combination of fire and water, dubbed "Fire and Water Whirlwind" by Lilian, after witnessing Tucker use it against Ash with a combination of Water Pulse and Fire Blast. This even made a rival of hers angry, thinking she thought he was not worthy of the move as May did not use it against him.

She also developed a love for making her own Pokéblocks with recipes that she thought up, including ones called "May's Purple Surprise" and "May's Pink Surprise" (Japanese: Haruka's Delicious and Haruka's Delicious 2). Unfortunately, the only ones who liked her "Purple Surprise" were her Munchlax and Jessie. Her "Pink Surprise" came from the recipe Professor Oak uses to make Ash's Snorlax's food. Thus, after May first fed it to her Munchlax, it was automatically made full. This Pokéblock was regularly used to feed Munchlax in order to prevent it from eating the food of others.


May and Drew
During her journey, she found a rival in Drew, a skilled and sometimes arrogant Coordinator. Drew became one of her main inspirations to try harder to sharpen her skills as a Coordinator. At first, Drew had claimed that May had "no style" as a Coordinator, but by the end of May's second Contest campaign, when she defeated him in the Kanto Grand Festival, he recognized her growth and skill. Another rival of hers, Harley, is a flamboyant man who goes to extremes to beat May and has no qualms about cheating or using unfair tactics. An example of Harley's depravity was seen in A Cacturne for the Worse, when he recorded Max telling him a story from May's childhood. May had been wearing a blue swimming cap in the ocean, and her mother had mistaken her for a Tentacool from afar and attempted to catch May with one of her Poké Balls. Harley played the recording of this story during the Izabe Island Pokémon Contest to embarrass May into losing. May was able to beat Harley in the end, but she claimed that she had never been more humiliated. Another example is when Harley joined forces with Team Rocket in an attempt to sabotage May's performance with Combusken, which ended up contributing to a more dazzling appeal.

At the Kanto Grand Festival, May also competed against Solidad, an experienced Coordinator to whom she lost in the semifinals. At the end of Pokémon the Series: Ruby and Sapphire, she left to compete with Drew, Harley, and Solidad in the Johto region, aiming to find her own battling style. The decision to stop traveling with Ash was an important one for May's character. Because Ash played the role of a mentor to her through most of the series, she was largely influenced by his offensive battle style. By the end of their journey through Kanto, May had realized that an offensive style was not necessarily the best for her and for Contests. Her constant use of dazzling attacks ultimately proved to be her downfall at the Kanto Grand Festival, when Solidad was able to recognize and counter these moves by leading May to attack and then successfully dodging. Her goal to find her own style was therefore also a goal to improve her Contest Battle skills and ultimately become a Top Coordinator.

May has Contest Passes to compete in Hoenn, Kanto and Johto. She also has a personal theme song, I Won't Lose! ~Haruka's Theme~, performed by KAORI.. It was first used as background music in Curbing the Crimson Tide and was used multiple times after that during May's Contest performances and battles. The song became the ending theme of the show between Pokémon Ranger - Deoxys' Crisis! (Part 2) and Home is Where the Start Is!.


May in Pokémon the Series: Diamond and Pearl
Pokémon the Series: Diamond and Pearl
May reappeared from Our Cup Runneth Over! to Strategy With a Smile! to participate in the Wallace Cup. During this period, she wore her game counterpart's outfit from Pokémon Emerald. She shared that many of her Pokémon had evolved and that she had already won three Johto Ribbons. Dawn recognized May upon meeting her and said that some people in the Sinnoh region called her the "Princess of Hoenn", causing May to blush.

In A Full Course Tag Battle!, May spoke with Ash and Brock about her journey in Johto, and revealed that her Eevee had evolved into Glaceon shortly before meeting them. Before starting training for the Wallace Cup, May suggested everyone go to the Seven Stars Restaurant on the Valor Lakefront. where they participated in a series of Tag Battles to earn a right to an exclusive meal. Before May and Dawn started their battles, Team Rocket had stolen the food supply, this motivated May to help find the food and when they found it, May and Dawn battled Jessie and James, defeating them easily.


May and Ash holding their halves of the Terracotta Ribbon
Once everything was resolved, May and Dawn had their battles against Roman and Kylie, winning using a combination of Water and Fire-type moves. At the end of the night, May remembered with Ash the moment they both competed for the Ribbon of Terracotta Town, and together with Dawn, May discovered that Ash was also interested in the competition.

During the Wallace Cup, May showed the new battle style that she had come up with after leaving Ash, battling against Dawn's rival Zoey and winning using her Beautifly. She made it all the way to the finals but narrowly lost to Dawn in the end. Afterwards, May returned to Johto to resume competing in Contests there.

May reappeared in a picture on Brock's memory wall in the special episode DPS02.


Pokémon the Series: Black & White

May in Pokémon Journeys: The Series
May reappeared in a fantasy in The Dream Continues!.

Pokémon Journeys: The Series
May reappeared in a flashback of the Wallace Cup in Reuniting for the First Time!, alongside Dawn. In the same episode, Chloe wore a Contest Costume that Serena mentioned was worn by the "Princess of Hoenn", referencing May's nickname.

In Partners in Time!, May was revealed to have returned to Hoenn when she appeared alongside Max, Serena, and Lisia, watching Ash's Masters Eight Tournament match against Leon. Soon after, when Pikachu was at the limit of his strength, May, Max, and Serena were shown to be anxious about the state of the battle, each holding on to another for comfort.

I Choose You!
May made a cameo appearance in the ending credits of I Choose You! alongside with Max.

Character

May and Max
May is generally a very sweet and optimistic girl. She enjoys feminine and cute things as well as shopping. In fact, she and Brock occasionally went on shopping trips together throughout Pokémon the Series: Ruby and Sapphire. May cares about her appearance, sometimes spending so much time in front of the mirror that it caused her traveling companions to become frustrated with her, such as in The Bicker the Better. May also is interested in helping other people with their romantic problems.

Though she is generally kind, she occasionally argues with her little brother, Max. The two had arguments since Max's debut episode, but one of their most notable was in Take This House and Shuppet. May's harsh words to Max made him declare that he hated May and he ran away for a portion of the episode. Even though she had been angry, May quickly felt guilty for hurting Max's feelings and became very worried that he would be hurt on his own. In Date Expectations, when Max again went missing, May revealed that she had promised her mother to always take care of Max on their journey, and was prepared to miss her last chance of qualifying for the Hoenn Grand Festival in order to find him. Though the siblings had many quarrels over their joint travels, May deeply cares for her brother and would go to great lengths to protect him.


May's rage at her loss of food
In You Never Can Taillow, May heard Brock used to act as a cook during Ash's journeys. As she, Max and Ash were hungry, she was the one who asked Brock if he could prepare some food for them. If a person or a Pokémon were to steal her food she would become extremely angry, which was demonstrated numerous times. Food was one of the few things May would become angry about, so it was an important tool to show a different side to her usually cheerful character. When May returned for Pokémon the Series: Diamond and Pearl, she expressed excitement over the chance to eat at the Seven Stars Restaurant, but having her meal stolen made her enraged. She was later shown enjoying a large cookie, once again affirming her love of food and sweets.


May after shopping
When May first left her home, she was only interested in the traveling aspect of a Pokémon journey. This sparked one of May's most memorable quirks in Hoenn, "May's Expeditions". Starting from A Mudkip Mission, May would occasionally make a camera lens with her fingers, pretending she was the host of a traveling show. Uniquely for one of Ash's friends, May originally didn't like Pokémon and was afraid of them, due to the trauma of being swarmed by a group of Tentacool when she was little. However, after seeing Ash risking his life to save his Pikachu on the day they met and later upon forming close bonds with her first two Pokémon, Torchic and Wurmple, May grew to care about Pokémon, which helped her overcome her dislike and fear of them.

As mentioned, May also enjoys making Pokéblock. She first learned about making Pokéblock in the episode Pokéblock, Stock and Berry when she met Kelly. She learned that Kelly's mother owned a Pokéblock shop, and May was curious about it. Kelly then taught her how to use a Berry Blender. May's first attempt of making a Pokéblock was not successful, but that didn't stop her from trying. In the episode Berry, Berry Interesting, May continued to make Pokéblock, calling the result "May's Purple Surprise". However, only her Munchlax had taken a liking to it. Later on, Professor Oak had created a Pokéblock recipe for May, which May calls "May's Pink Surprise", that is specially made for Munchlax, similarly to the recipe used to feed Ash's Snorlax. May uses it to stop her Munchlax from causing too much trouble on many occasions.


May and Dawn
May was unsure on what path and goal to pursue, even though she was expected to become a Pokémon Trainer like her father. However, after witnessing Pokémon Contests in All Things Bright and Beautifly!, May decided to become a Pokémon Coordinator, and has been training both herself and her Pokémon since then. In Hi Ho Silver Wind!, May revealed that she stayed in contact with many of the friends she made through competing in Pokémon Contests, using emails, phone calls and letters. This included Kelly, Savannah, Sandra, Timmy, Dr. Abby, and Janet. May also said that being friends with the people she met throughout her journey, and knowing they were cheering for her, gave her the confidence to overcome any nervousness she could face.


May after catching a Pokémon
Throughout her journey with Ash, Brock, and Max, May has changed remarkably as a person and Trainer, but maintains her habit of finding popular food spots and her sweet nature. May has also learned to not take her Pokémon for granted, as seen in Cruisin' for a Losin', when she realized how hard she pushed her Bulbasaur in the Rubello Pokémon Contest and that the first two ribbons that she won were because her Pokémon came through for her. In addition, May has exceptionally improved her battling skills, as shown in her battle against Drew in the Kanto Grand Festival. As time passed, May became a well-known coordinator and received the nickname "Princess of Hoenn", which was stated by Dawn in A Full Course Tag Battle! and Serena in Reuniting for the First Time!.

May's Contest cry is "Take the stage!" (Japanese: ステージ・オン！ Stage On!). In the English dub, she also uses variations, such as "On stage!". In the Japanese version, May usually ends her sentences with (Japanese: ～かも ~kamo), a word often used to express uncertainty.

Pokémon

May and her Pokémon in Pokémon the Series: Ruby and Sapphire.
The Pokémon she acquired on the course of her journey appear to resemble the Pokémon that Ash had obtained at some point at the beginning of his own journey. At first, she preferred cute Pokémon and dazzling techniques, but over the course of her journey, she was able to obtain Pokémon outside that preference. She has a tendency to rely on luck, often using her Skitty's Assist or her Munchlax's Metronome to win. Most of May's Pokémon were not caught through battle. Unlike many of Ash's friends, May has never had a consistently disobedient Pokémon.

Throughout her journey, May has used combinations with her Pokémon, as she used her Blaziken, while it was a Combusken, and Wartortle's, while it was a Squirtle, Fire and Water-type attacks to form the fusion of Fire and Water. Some of May's Pokémon have shown to be naturally inclined to Pokémon Contests, such as her Beautifly, Skitty, and Wartortle. Her Blaziken is usually used in battle as her strongest Pokémon, but it has also been used in the appeal rounds in Pokémon Contests.

Jaden:
---------------------------------
Personality
Jaden is friendly, optimistic, laid-back, enthusiastic, kind, confident, funny, and very passionate about Dueling. Jaden loves Dueling and believes that all problems can ultimately be solved through it. He keeps going no matter how hard things get or how hopeless it seems, with a few exceptions (though it doesn't take much encouragement for him to start fighting again), although he does sometimes doubt himself. He always shows respect towards his opponents, with a few exceptions, even complimenting them during a Duel.

Jaden shows little interest in areas outside of Dueling, which extends to his classes. When he chooses to attend them, he generally falls asleep. Despite his low grades, he is still regarded as one of Duel Academy's best Duelists. However, this attitude eventually shows itself as one of his greatest flaws, and causes him to be targeted by Mr. Stein. He shows a lack of knowledge in areas outside of Dueling, even showing in one instance that he is unaware of what the term "fiancee" means, and forgetting that the holographic water will not drown him in another.

Jaden also seems to be ignorant of the dislike that other individuals have for him, as despite the obvious tension between the two, he considers himself to be good friends with Chazz Princeton. His carefree attitude and lack of thought get him into trouble occasionally, such as when he handed the Satellite Keys to Sartorius and still expected the latter to Duel him before using them. He occasionally shows signs of intellect, such as determining that Titan's Shadow Game was a fake, and figuring out that both Brier and Beauregard were the Duel Giant on another occasion.

One of Jaden's common traits is that he tends to make jokes or puns, even in some situations where it is not appropriate. Most of the jokes he makes are Duel-related but on a few occasions he does make jokes at someone's expense. For example, he called Crowler "Cyclops" when the latter got struck in the eye with a tennis ball. Another example is when Jaden Duels The Society of Light controlled Alexis and she tells him to "Throw in the game" to which the former replies "The only thing I throw in is the towel on laundry day."

Jaden has a close bond with his cards, to the point where he has no problem with an opponent insulting him, but is angered when they insult his cards. An example of this is when Crowler calls his "Winged Kuriboh" lame and Jaden immediately gets angry; this happens also when Gravekeeper's Chief repeatedly refers to Winged Kuriboh as a "rodent". Jaden is also fiercely loyal to his friends, which often results in his risking his life to save them. This is ultimately exploited by Yubel and Brron, who drive him to the brink of despair via the elimination of his loved ones as he demonstrates his unnatural rage, which weakens him enough to be possessed by the spirit of his ancestor. After being freed from the influence of The Supreme King, Jaden shows many signs of depression, and constantly asks himself where he went wrong, and is horrified by what he's done while ruling the alternate dimension. Even after the sacrifice of Aster Phoenix, Jaden is still unable to regain his resolve. When confronted by Guardian Baou, Jaden even resigns himself to be killed at the same spot his friends were sacrificed. His resolve is stirred by the arrival of Bastion Misawa, who reveals that Yubel is responsible for everything that's transpired and want Jaden to become the next Supreme King. Wanting revenge, Jaden defeats Baou and moves on, witnessing what he believed to be the death of Zane Truesdale, which stirs him to continue.

After his ordeal in season three, Jaden develops a much more cynical outlook on life and is far more brooding and serious. He finds himself unable to enjoy Dueling and attempts to end his Duels as quickly as possible. He even ceases to use his catchphrases. Despite still caring deeply for his friends, he is much more distant towards them, not wanting them to be hurt by the danger his presence tends to attract. He begins to recover his love of Dueling during the Pair Duel tournament and fully recovers it during his Duel against Yugi. This is proven in Yu-Gi-Oh! 3D Bonds Beyond Time. Even when Jaden was still fused with Yubel and the Supreme King, he showed the same personality as the one he had in the first three seasons, showing that he in fact loves having a good time and Dueling again.

Abilities
Jaden has an incredible luck of the draw, as demonstrated when he went on a 10-day streak of drawing the Golden Eggwich correctly. He has also demonstrated this when he correctly picked a Joker from a pair of playing cards and picked a salmon-flavored sushi from among apricot, dried-fish, and salmon-flavored sushi (which were virtually indistinguishable from an outside perspective).[10] When Dueling Jaden often draws the exact card he needs to win through sheer luck rather than supernatural powers.

Jaden demonstrated incredible athletic abilities, seen when he jumped into the air at a great height to hit a tennis ball served by Mindy. After he fused Yubel's soul with his own, his athletic ability has shown to have increased. He was seen jumping on platforms while trying to escape from an exploding KaibaCorp building, as well as jumping from building to building when he was attacked by Paradox.

Jaden has had an ability called the The Gentle Darkness inside his soul, which gives him the power to see and hear Duel Monster spirits and control them. This is the main power that is used by the Supreme King that Jaden inherited from his past life. While under the Supreme Kings persona, Jaden quickly established his own monarch of Duel Monster Spirits. Supposedly, this power also created the "Dark Fusion" Spell and the Evil Hero counterparts of his Elemental Heroes. In the fourth season, Jaden can use it to materialize Duel Monsters and their powers. After the events in the Dimension World arc, Jaden now has the power of Yubel and the Supreme King inside him. When he materializes his Duel Monsters, he can make them even stronger. Yubel's power allows him to sense people's thoughts and emotions, see visions of the future, and protects him from other supernatural powers, like hypnosis and Nightshroud's influence. Yubel's powers also let him quickly figure out that Honest was masquerading as Fujiwara. Jaden's eyes take the same color as Yubel's or the Supreme King when manifesting either of their abilities. He is also able to project his voice out for people in yonder reach to hear, as shown in the final Duel with Nightshroud.

Due to being fused with Yubel, Nightshroud described Jaden as not a human being, but a strange blend between a human and a Duel Monster spirit and refered to him as a "foreign object".

Etymology
The word "Judai" means "teenager." "Yuki", if not following the kanji, has multiple meanings, the most common being "courage;" thus it can be inferred into the phrase "courageous teenager." It should also be noted that the kanji for "Yuki" is the combination of Yugi and Joey's Japanese given names. His English given name means "gift from God." Jaden is the only protagonist to have his first name changed in the dub. He is also the only protagonist whose given name does not contain "Yu"; instead, his surname contains it.

Biography
History
Young Jaden and Yubel
Jaden during his childhood with Yubel watching over him.

As a child, Jaden loved Duel Monsters and from an early age was able to sense Duel Monster Spirits. Both of his parents, however, were rarely at home, as they were busy working. As a result, Jaden spent many of his days playing Duel Monsters with neighborhood children. His favorite card was "Yubel", which was a gift from his father. Due to this and his ability to sense and speak to Duel Spirits, Jaden formed a strong connection and bond with the card’s spirit. However, whenever Jaden played "Yubel", something horrible would happen to his opponent. The first of them was Osamu, a neighborhood friend of Jaden’s.

YoungJaden
Jaden as a child, drawing his card designs for KaibaCorp's contest.

After Osamu defeated Jaden in a duel, he fell into a coma which was caused by Yubel. This was because the spirit of the "Yubel" card was overly protective of Jaden and sought to punish any and all perceived threats to him and their friendship. This included his dueling opponents, as well as anyone who dared to anger it by causing Jaden sadness. After that incident, no one wished to duel Jaden anymore so long as he kept Yubel in his deck, as they feared for their safety.[12] Despite realizing that Yubel was the cause of these incidents, Jaden refused to throw her card away, due to the strong bond he held with her. As a result, Jaden was alienated by others and lost all his friends, causing him to suffer from extreme loneliness.

Around this time, Jaden entered a card design contest held by KaibaCorp, and won with his monster designs, which included the "Neo-Spacians" and "Dandylion."[15] As part of the project, the cards he designed were launched into space, with the hopes that the cards would be imbued with space waves. Jaden also requested that his "Yubel" card be sent up in a separate capsule, hoping that the space waves would pacify the malicious spirit of the card.[12] Soon after, Jaden began having nightmares where he would see Yubel burning in flames. These nightmares were actually Yubel psychically communicating with Jaden, in the hopes of being rescued from her painful exposure to the Light of Destruction. Due to his nightmares, Jaden couldn’t get any sleep which led his parents to arranged for him to have a medical procedure performed on him, which not only stopped the nightmares but also inadvertently suppressed all memories of Yubel.[16] Also, Jaden's medical procedure erased the memories of him participating in the card design contest.
He attended Duel Academy and was put in the Slifer Red Dorm, the dorm with the least privileges, due to his poor grades in the entrance exam. As time goes on, he becomes the academy's best Duelist and saves the world and the academy from many threats such as Kagemaru and the Shadow Riders, the Light of Destruction possessed Sartorius, Yubel, and finally the malicious entity Nightshroud. After three years, he graduates from Duel Academy and pursues his own journey to improve himself.
Jaden overslept on the morning that he was scheduled to take his entrance exam in order to enroll in the Academy. As he rushed through the streets to make it to the test center in time, he bumped into Yugi Muto, dropping his cards in the process. Yugi asked Jaden if he was a Duelist and gave him a "Winged Kuriboh" card, telling Jaden that he felt that "the card belongs with him." When he arrived, the head teacher at Duel Academy, Dr. Crowler, was hesitant to allow Jaden to take his exam, but a phone call from his superior, Chancellor Sheppard changed his mind. Crowler dueled Jaden himself, and disregarded the rule that he is to use an exam Deck, instead using his personal Deck. Jaden is impressed by Crowler's "Ancient Gear Golem," but is able to hold off its attack with "Winged Kuriboh," whose spirit he is capable of seeing and communicating with, something that most people would not be able to do. He proceeds to win the Duel using "Elemental Hero Flame Wingman" and "Skyscraper," with him citing the former as his favorite card.[1]

Jaden is accepted into Duel Academy and is placed in the Slifer Red dorm, which is the lowest-ranked of the three dorms. Jaden's roommates were Syrus Truesdale and Chumley Huffington. Jaden would then get himself in a confrontation with Chazz Princeton, an Obelisk Blue student who had witnessed Crowler's defeat to Jaden. Believing his victory to be a fluke, Chazz challenged Jaden to a Duel, which is interrupted midway through. Though Chazz believed he would have won, Jaden had just drawn a card that would win him the Duel.[2] Dr. Crowler, eager to exact his revenge on Jaden, began plans to get him expelled. He placed a fake love note in Jaden's gym locker, on which he had forged the signature of Alexis Rhodes, one of the top female students. Syrus found the note instead of Jaden, and rowed across the lake to the girls dorm. Jaden followed and saved Syrus from expulsion by defeating Alexis in a Duel.[17] The owner of Duel Academy's card shop, Ms. Dorothy, gifted Jaden with some rare cards after he helped her push her van up the hill when it stalled. In Duel Academy's promotion exams, Jaden had his rematch with Chazz, who had been supplied powerful cards by Dr. Crowler. Jaden's use of "Transcendent Wings" to evolve "Winged Kuriboh" to level ten won him the Duel, and he is therefore allowed to move up to the Ra Yellow dorm but he declined the opportunity.[18]

Crowler's crusade against Jaden continued, with him sending Titan, a self-proclaimed "Shadow Duelist" to defeat Jaden. Titan used illusions to make it appear he had the ability to start Shadow Duels. Jaden was skeptical throughout the whole Duel, and is proven correct - it was a sham. They Duel in the Abandoned Dorm, and the spirits of the dorm are angered by Titan. A real Shadow Duel actually did begin - with Jaden still refusing to believe in it until the Duel's end, when he is saved by Winged Kuriboh.[19][20] Due to their trespass at the Abandoned Dorm, both Jaden and Syrus were nearly expelled. They got a chance to stay by participating in a Tag Duel. Should they win, their records would be cleared. Jaden Dueled Syrus as practice for the latter, and Jaden defeated him. Finding that Syrus had confidence problems, he is then told by Alexis that they stem from Syrus' relationship with his older brother, Zane Truesdale, who is known as the best Duelist at the academy.[21] Determined to help Syrus and to see how he ranks against the best, Jaden challenged Zane to a Duel. Though the latter compliments Jaden's abilities, Jaden suffers his first loss since arriving at the academy, losing to Zane's "Cyber End Dragon." Despite this, Jaden does not get upset over his loss and thanks Zane for dueling with him. The duel between him and Zane helped spur Syrus' confidence.[22] The two were unable to function as a team in their Duel against the Paradox Brothers at first,[23] but pulled things together in the end, allowing them to stay at the academy.[24]

Jaden developed a friendship and rivalry with Bastion Misawa. Both had expressed desire to Duel one another since witnessing their respective entrance exams. After Bastion's victory with a Duel against Chazz, he was offered a promotion to Obelisk Blue but declines, stating he will not enter it until he becomes the best student in the freshman class. To do so, he believes he needs to defeat Jaden. However, he does not wish to Duel him right away, as he wished to develop a Deck specifically to counter Jaden's.[3] When Chazz leaves Duel Academy Jaden and Syrus try to find him with Jasmine Mindy and Alexis. On the way they encounter Wheeler a cybernetic monkey who kidnaps Jasmine. Jaden and the others try to save her. Wheeler's doctor arrives and says that the monkey only knows dueling. Jaden beats him in a duel and lets Wheeler live with his family. [25] Jaden stayed at Duel Academy during winter break, finding himself in a life-threatening Duel with the spirit of the "Jinzo" card. Jaden felt real pain as his Life Points decreased, and his body parts fade as he is attacked. Though he wins, he gets his first taste of a Shadow Duel,[26] though he does not realize this until a later date.[27] Jaden then found himself in a Duel over the affections of Alexis against the captain of Duel Academy's tennis team, Harrington Rosewood. Harrington gets an early lead during the Duel with his "Ace" cards. After Jaden deals major damage to him via direct attacks, he then activates "Deuce" and almost wins with its effect, but Jaden was able to save himself win the Duel, becoming Alexis' fiancee as per the terms that Harrington set. However, he has no clue what fiancee means. Alexis calls him an idiot in response (in the English version, she tells that it means they're just friends, "for now").[28]

Jaden got an opportunity to Duel against the Deck of Yugi Muto when the said Deck went on tour at Duel Academy. A copycat Duelist named Dimitri stole the Deck and Jaden Dueled him to get it back. He found himself in awe of Yugi's monsters, and was excited when he defeated "Dark Magician" with "Elemental Hero Bladedge". However, Dimitri Summoned "Dark Magician of Chaos," which devastates Jaden.[29] He hung on, and successfully defeated Dimitri with "Flame Wingman," recovering the Deck.[30] Jaden later welcomes a new student named Blair Flannigan to Duel Academy. However it's revealed she is a girl and after Jaden beats her in a Duel she says that she came to meet Zane. However, she leaves because she is too young.[31] Jaden is nominated by Zane to be the academy's representative against North Academy, with Chancellor Sheppard accepting it. Crowler nominated Bastion in response, and he proposed the two of them Duel in order to decide who the representative would be. Bastion claims that he's nearly finished his Deck that will counter Jaden's strategy. Jaden gained an early advantage in the Duel, but is set back when Bastion negated "Polymerization" with "Cursed Seal of the Forbidden Spell", preventing Jaden from Fusion Summoning in the usual way.[4] Jaden is forced to play defensively as Bastion's "Water Dragon" and "Hyozanryu" destroyed his monsters. Jaden unveiled a new "Elemental Hero" - "Wildheart." Using it and and "Cyclone Boomerang," Jaden won the Duel via effect damage. Bastion then promised to create another Deck to challenge Jaden again someday.[32] Jaden found his rivalry with Chazz renewed when the latter returned to Duel Academy as the representative of North Academy. Jaden overheard an outburst of Chazz's, in which he expressed dislike for the burden Slade Princeton and Jagger Princeton put on him to win. Chazz unveils new "Armed Dragon" cards which prove to be more effective against Jaden than his previous Decks had been.[33] Jaden is surprised to discover that Chazz has gained a Spirit Partner in Ojama Yellow and that Chazz can see Duel Spirits as well. Jaden won using a strategy involving "Hero Kid." Chazz's brothers berate him after the Duel, and Jaden steps in to defend him. Chazz decided to remain at Duel Academy afterward.[34]

Against the Shadow Riders
The Slifer Red dorm head and alchemy professor, Lyman Banner, held a hike and picnic to the ruins that exist on the island. Jaden, Syrus, Chumley and Alexis attended. While there, they appear to be transported to the past, to a time when the ruins were still in use. Jaden's friends were captured, but Jaden himself is saved by Yasmin. He eventually ends up in a Duel against Gravekeeper's Chief, in which he and his friends will be buried alive if he loses. He found that the pain he experiences from losing Life Points to be real.[35] Jaden narrowly defeated the Chief by using the effect of his "Elemental Hero Necroshade" to Summon "Elemental Hero Bladedge". The Chief gifted Jaden with one half of a Shadow Charm pendent after the Duel, stating that it should help protect him in any further Shadow Duels he may participate in. The group is returned to their own time.[36]

Chancellor Sheppard selected Jaden as one of the seven Duelists to hold the Spirit Keys. These keys unseal the Spirit Gates, behind which the Sacred Beast cards are sealed. The legend goes that if the cards are released, a catastrophe will occur. A group of individuals known as the Shadow Riders will arrive and attempt to steal the keys. Jaden believed he will be targeted first, believing himself to be the strongest target. Alexis also believed Jaden will be first, as his Slifer Red uniform marks him as a weaker Duelist. In attempting to warn Jaden of this, she is transported to the volcano with Jaden, where the first Shadow Rider, Nightshroud, awaits. As it turns out, he targeted Jaden for neither of the previously given reasons - he did so because he owns the other half of the Shadow Charm pendent, which pointed him in Jaden's direction. Syrus and Chumley are taken hostage, so Jaden accepted the Shadow Duel, in which the loser's soul will be sealed in a card. Nightshroud gained an early advantage by combining "Red-Eyes Black Dragon" and "Inferno Fire Blast".[27] Jaden made a comeback, but Nightshroud unveils "Red-Eyes Darkness Dragon". Jaden narrowly avoided defeat by Summoning "Elemental Hero Wildedge". Nightshroud's soul was sealed in the card, but he remains barely conscious, as Nightshroud was controlling someone else - the brother of Alexis, Atticus Rhodes.[37]

Left weak from his Duel with Nightshroud, Jaden watched from the sidelines as Dr. Crowler is defeated by the second Shadow Rider, the vampire known as Camula, having his soul sealed in a doll in the process.[38] He then also witnessed Zane who meets the same fate when Camula threatens Syrus' soul.[39] Enraged by the fall of his friends, Jaden challenged Camula after Atticus informed him that his complete Shadow Charm may be able to negate the power of Camula's and prevent souls from being stolen during the Duel. This turned out to be true, as Camula is forced to use her own soul as a cost in the activation of "Illusion Gate," rather than a spectator's as she had against Zane. Jaden was able to defeat her with "Elemental Hero Shining Flare Wingman," who gains ATK for each fallen "Elemental Hero" in the Graveyard. With this, Camula's soul was taken by "Illusion Gate" and the souls of Crowler and Zane were restored.[40]

Jaden began having nightmares regarding losing Shadow Duels, knowing that great harm could come to his friends. While trying to relax at the hot springs, he, Syrus, Chumley and Chazz are pulled through a portal to an underground cave. They are confronted by Kaibaman, causing Jaden to question if the latter is a Shadow Rider. He refused to answer, instead wishing to Duel, stating that Jaden seemed to have lost his fighting spirit. Kaibaman used the same Deck as Seto Kaiba, and Jaden is ultimately defeated. However, he realized that he still had fun during the Duel and Kaibaman taught him that if he is scared of defeat, he will cease to grow as a Duelist.[41]. When Slade challenges Chazz to a duel for the fate of Duel Academy, Jaden accompanies Chazz to the Reject Well to find monsters with less than 500 attack points. They find Ojama Black and Ojama Green who end up in Chazz's deck. Chazz uses his new monsters to defeat Slade and save Duel Academy[42].Jaden is present when Bastion is defeated by the third Shadow Rider, Tania, who takes him as her "husband" afterwards.[5] Jaden overcame her "Amazoness" monsters using "Wildheart" and the effect of her own Field Spell Card, "Amazoness Arena".[43] Jaden ends up mistaking a submarine captain named Admiral for the next Shadow Rider and though Jaden defeats him, Admiral kidnapped him, hoping to make him the top student at his planned underwater Duel Academy. Jaden stole an escape boat in order to get away, but did not make it back to Duel Academy until three days later.[44]

Jaden's next opponent was Abidos the Third, an ancient pharaoh revived by the Shadow Riders who was once known as the "God of Duels." Jaden defeated him with fewer problems than expected, and Abidos realized that his servants had always let him win. Abidos is impressed by Jaden's Dueling and returns to the afterlife, with Jaden promising to meet him there when he dies so that they can Duel again.[45] Alexis and Chazz successfully defeated Shadow Riders Titan and Don Zaloog, respectively.[46][47] After that, only one Shadow Rider remaining. During this time, Professor Banner disappeared, and both Chazz and Alexis are defeated by the final Shadow Rider. Jaden confronts him in the basement of the Abandoned Dorm. He eventually revealed himself as Professor Banner. He stated that Jaden must prove himself as the "ultimate alchemist", comparing Jaden's process of using "Polymerization" to fuse monsters to be similar to alchemic processes.[48] Banner explained that he came down with an illness after traveling the world in the name of alchemy, and was forced to entrust his soul to a homunculus in order to survive. Wishing to pay back the one who funded his research, he aimed to obtain the Sacred Beasts. Banner is eventually defeated when Jaden countered the latter's removed from play strategy with "Elemental Hero Electrum." Banner left his Emerald Tablet Shadow Charm to Jaden, warning him of the impending disaster that the Sacred Beasts will bring about.[49]

After Chazz loses to Alexis in a duel, Jaden witnessed the Spirit Gates open, without the aid of the Spirit Keys, which Chazz currently had. The keys led them to the gates, at which point the keys disappeared into the seven pillars surrounding the area. The ground quaked, and a black box rose from the center of the gates, inside of which was a smaller, box that contains the Sacred Beasts. The true mastermind of the ploy revealed himself - Kagemaru, the elderly Chairman of Duel Academy. He intends to use the powers of the Beasts to restore his own youth. He specifically challenged Jaden to a Duel in favor of rest of the gathered students and teachers. Jaden found "Sabatiel - The Philosopher's Stone" inside the Emerald Tablet, and places it in his Deck. From within a life support tube supported by a spider-walker, Kagemaru Duels Jaden. Kagemaru Summoned "Uria, Lord of Searing Flames" and "Hamon, Lord of Striking Thunder," which drove Jaden into a corner. With two Beasts present, they began to absorb energy from card spirits around the world, which was then used to restore Kagemaru's youth. He appears a young man once more, and continued the Duel.[50] Using a series of Spell and Trap Cards, Jaden destroyed both of the Beasts with "Elemental Hero Neo Bubbleman." Kagemaru was able to revive them, however, and further Summoned the third Beast - "Raviel, Lord of Phantasms." Jaden used the "Sabatiel the philosopher's stone" card to his advantage, and was able to pentuple the ATK of "Electrum" to win the Duel. The power absorbed is returned to the Duel Spirits, and Kagemaru became elderly once more. He begged for forgiveness, and Jaden easily gave it to him, while motivating him to try to stand on his own. Jaden proceeded to accidentally injure the old man with a hug.[51]

Jaden was present at Chumley's Duel with Dr. Crowler, and supported his friend before he departed to become a card designer for Industrial Illusions.[52] Jaden is then chosen by Zane to be the latter's final opponent before his graduation, in a match that the whole school will attend. Jaden accepted the Duel. Knowing that Zane was a powerful opponent who defeated him before, Jaden attempted to think his way through the Duel, which backfired as he misplayed his cards and failed to enjoy himself as he usually would.. Zane gains an advantage by constantly fusing and splitting his "Cyber End Dragon".[53] Zane snapped Jaden out of his rut, and the latter began to Duel with his heart once more, rather than his head. In this way, Jaden became the opponent that Zane had wanted him to be. Both Duelists were able to counter the strategies of the other, and Duel ultimately ended in a DRAW as the crowd applauded the spectacle.[54]

Society of Light
Ep 53
Jaden Dueling Aster for the first time.

Jaden has begun his second year at Duel Academy. Unaware of new student Aster Phoenix's status as a pro, Jaden Duels him, eager to teach a new student about Dueling. During the Duel, Ms. Dorothy reveals that Aster constructed the Deck out of eight packs of cards he purchased that morning. Jaden attempts to give him advice, which Aster pretends to take. Aster is not impressed by Jaden, and leaves after being defeated. Later, after the Duel, Syrus Truesdale realizes who Aster really was, and Jaden is eager to have a rematch with Aster when the latter is using his true Deck. The next day he, Syrus and Alexis watch Chazz duel Reginald Van Howell III where he learns that Crowler made Chazz the star to increase publicity much to his confusion. Chazz gives a speech about no matter the rank he will still win causing Jaden to feel impressed by his change in character. After Chazz wins Jaden rushes up to his rival and thanks him for defending the Slivers even though Chazz argued that it was not his intention to do so. Jaden then learns from Syrus that Bonaparte and Crowler plan to remove the Slifer dorm.

A few days later, Syrus and Jaden are walking through the woods. The duo got caught sleeping in class, so Crowler is making them deliver 14 new Duel Disks to students who had lost theirs. Jaden wonders why so many people were losing their Disks, and Syrus explains it's because of a bully that is challenging them to Duels and then taking them. Syrus had lost to this bully as well, so Jaden decides it's time to confront this guy and get the disks back. They run to river, and standing on the bridge is the bully,Tyranno Hassleberry, the same Ra Yellow student that was picking on Crowler and Bonaparte when he arrived at the school. He tries to intimidate Jaden with his strength, but Jaden just shrugs it off and challenges him to a Duel. Hassleberry also has a bunch of other Ra Yellows who support him like an army troop. They and Syrus watch the Duel, and Jaden states that if he wins, Hassleberry has to give all the Duel Disks he stole back. Although Hassleberry fights admirably, he still loses to Jaden's combo of fusing "Elemental Hero Avian" and "Elemental Hero Wildheart" with "Polymerization" to Fusion Summon "Elemental Hero Wild Wingman" and in the end, using "De-Fusion" to separate them back. After the Duel, Hassleberry agrees to give back the Duel Disks. Later that night, Hassleberry moves to the Slifer dorm, having decided to live in the dorm because he feels that he could learn a lot about Dueling from Jaden. Jaden later encourages Syrus to have more faith in himself as a duelist when the latter is chosen by Jean-Louis Bonaparte to duel Missy. The Vice Chancellor says if Syrus wins than he will be moved up Ra Yellow. Syrus eventually wins and gives Jaden Power Bond.

Sometime later, Jaden has just recently finished a Duel with Bastion Misawa in the Duel Arena, using "Elemental Hero Shining Flare Wingman" to destroy "Water Dragon" to get the win. That night, the group gathers inside the Slifer Red dorm to watch Zane Truesdale's next Pro League match. Finding out that Zane's opponent will be Aster Phoenix, Jaden is eager to see what Aster's actual Deck consists of. To everyone's surprise including Zane's, Aster reveals that his Deck has an "Elemental Hero" theme, similar to Jaden's. However, when Aster fuses Elemental Heroes "Avian" and "Burstinatrix", he does not Fusion Summon "Elemental Hero Flame Wingman", but "Elemental Hero Phoenix Enforcer". To his friends' amazement, Jaden was unaware that this Fusion Monster even existed. Aster counters nearly every move Zane makes and even causes him to take damage from "Power Bond". The Duel ultimately ends with Aster the winner, much to the shock of all of Duel Academy.

Aster Phoenix holds a press conference after his defeat of Zane Truesdale in the Pro League. He issues a challenge to Jaden Yuki, knowing that both of them play "Elemental Heroes". He states he'll be coming to Duel Academy tomorrow. Aster meets with his manager, Sartorius. Aster doesn't seem to have any real interest in Dueling Jaden, but is doing so once more on Sartorius' advice. Aster arrives that night by skysurfing. Aster thwarts the escape of a man who was robbing Duel Academy's card shop. He appears to be looking for a certain card and when he does not find it, he tosses the man's cards causally on the ground. The Duel begins and Aster Summons "Shining Phoenix Enforcer" while Jaden Summons " Shining Flare Wingman". Aster uses a strange Field Spell Card called "Clock Tower Prison", which appears to turn its hands each turn and do nothing else. Aster plays "D - Time" and Special Summons "Destiny Hero - Doom Lord", a monster that no one in the crowd is familiar with. Its effect removes "Shining Flare Wingman" from play.

Aster unveils his "Destiny Heroes" and Jaden's "Elemental Heroes" can't seem to compete. Despite the "Destiny Heroes" relatively low attack points, their effects push Jaden into a corner, as Aster uses "Misfortune" to deal damage while continuing to place Clock Counters on "Clock Tower Prison". On the turn that the fourth Clock Counter is placed, Jaden would be able to deal enough damage to win. However, "Clock Tower Prison" renders Aster immune to damage when it has enough Counters. Jaden plays "Fusion Gate" and because "Clock Tower Prison" was destroyed, Aster can Summon his ultimate monster - "Destiny Hero - Dreadmaster", whose ATK are equal to the sum of the attack points of the other "Destiny Heroes" on the Field.

Jaden beaten by Aster
Jaden passed out after being defeated by Aster.

Aster explains his past. His father was a card designer for Industrial Illusions, who designed the "Destiny Heroes" himself. One day, Aster came home to find his father dead (kidnapped in the dub). The person who did it also took one of the "Destiny Hero" cards, which was known to be the most powerful among them. Aster's vigilante activity is centered around stopping crime to find the person who took his father from him, as he would be able to identify them by their possession of the stolen card. His "Dreadmaster" negates the effect of Jaden's "Elemental Hero Thunder Giant" and wins Aster the Duel with its attack. Jaden falls to the ground, his cards flying about, and they turn blank as he falls.

After Jaden Yuki's loss to Aster Phoenix, he claims he can't see his cards and they're blank. However, this appears to be how Jaden sees his Deck as everyone else sees nothing wrong with his cards. Everyone, Syrus Truesdale the most, is worried about it. Jaden ultimately decided to leave Duel Academy.

Later, Jaden Yuki is stranded in a boat when a comet hits. Afterwards, he is transported into Neo Space, a Duel Monsters Spirit World that represents and protects the delicate balance between Light and Darkness. Within this Limbo, Jaden ends up on a planet called Dolphina (which apparently is an uncharted planet neighboring Jupiter), where he is greeted by a dolphin-like creature named "Aquos" (who is later revealed to be the spirit of "Neo-Spacian Aqua Dolphin"), who explains that "the Gentle Darkness" is in danger of being obliterated by a mysterious "Dark Light", and only Jaden Yuki is able to fight off this entity and save the universe.

JadenAquos
Jaden Dueling the robot with Aquos watching.

Just then, an unusual Duel Robot sent by this "Dark Light" arrives, and Jaden must defeat it in a Duel, using cards salvaged from a satellite. Jaden's was in shocked when he can see the cards he was holding but was more shocked when he discovers that the cards were contained within a KaibaCorp satellite, which was carrying cards he'd designed for a global contest held by Seto Kaiba a few years ago. Seeing this and due to his suppressed memories from his medical treatment he went through as a child, Jaden figures out and realizes that he was the winner of the contest.

After winning the Duel, Jaden rediscovers his love for Dueling and regains his resolve, and then sets out to return to Duel Academy and stop this mysterious "Light", however while Jaden finds himself back on Duel Academy, he finds that he is in a forest that is far from where the school building actually is. As his friends deal with the problems around them, Jaden is still trying to find his way back to the Duel Academy building. He complains that he is hungry and wants some curry right now. The rivalry between Syrus Truesdale and Tyranno Hassleberry intensifies, even with Jaden absent. At the suggestion of Alexis Rhodes, the two decide to Duel to decide who Jaden's true "best friend" ("aniki" or "little brother" in the Japanese version). Jaden himself is close to getting back, and is climbing the cliff face on the opposite end of the island. Sometime later, Syrus and Hassleberry are eating in the Slifer Red dorm, and the dinner is Jaden Yuki's favorite - fried shrimp. They eat the shrimp that was intended for Jaden, as he isn't there, and hope that wherever he is, he's not starving. Jaden is still wandering through the forest at the point, and comments that he suddenly tastes fried shrimp, which only makes him hungrier. Wheeler the monkey is also in the forest, pushing a large cart of discarded furniture. He finds Jaden, who has collapsed from hunger. He wakes him up, and Jaden hallucinates that the cart of furniture is really "Ancient Gear Golem". Jaden then has a flashback to his Duel with Dr. Crowler in episode 1.

After that, Jaden sees Wheeler hitting his cart with his fist, and imagines that he's Bastion Misawa, thus having a flashback to his Duel with him in episode 22. After this, he imagines that Wheeler is actually Chazz Princeton and has flashbacks to their Duel in episode episode 4. After this, he proceeds to imagine that the monkey is Zane Truesdale and flashes back to episode 8. After that's over, Wheeler throws a bucket of water at Jaden, and this finally wakes him up fully. He also gives him a bunch of bananas to eat. Jaden thanks him, and heads off to continue his trip back to Duel Academy. However, he ends up going the wrong way, this despite the fact that Duel Academy is visible through the trees in the direction he doesn't take. There is also a sign in that direction pointing towards Duel Academy. Jaden's stupidity actually causes the inanimate roadsign to sweat drop and face fault.

A few days later, Alexis Rhodes is set to Duel Aster Phoenix. The fate of the Slifer Red dorm hangs in the balance. If Aster wins, then it will be demolished. If Alexis wins the dorm remains. Vice-Chancellor Bonaparte is confident that Aster will win, being Pro League Duelist. Jaden finally makes it back to Duel Academy and is lead by a light into a cave. He meets another "Neo-Spacian" there, and then hurries to the Academy. He takes Alexis' place in the Duel, and his rematch with Aster begins. Aster uses his "Destiny Heroes" again, and Jaden unveils Contact Fusion, which the "Neo-Spacians" can use to fuse with "Elemental Hero Neos" without "Polymerization". However, even he was unaware that this results in the Fusion Monster returning to the Fusion Deck at the End Phase, and is reduced to 200 Life Points via direct attacks as a result. Aster is confident he will win since Jaden has no clue on how to use his new cards, but Jaden refuses to give up and notes to himself, he still has a lot to learn about his new Deck as "Elemental Hero Aqua Neos" went back to his Fusion Deck on the End Phase without his knowledge. The two Duelists continually counter the moves of the other, revealing more and more of their new Decks. Aster soon gets out "Destiny Hero - Dogma". Jaden saves himself from an attack that would end the Duel, but now both players are down to a few Life Points. Jaden is still confident he can continue, but Aster doesn't believe so, claiming there is no monster in Jaden's Deck that can help him. Jaden states that may have been the case with his old Deck, but it won't be with his new one. He decides to prove so by showing Aster a brand new hero in his Deck. Jaden then plays "Neo Space", which lets his "Neos" Fusion Monsters remain on the field past the End Phase, and Summons "Elemental Hero Flare Neos". Jaden attacks, but Aster quickly plays "D - Shield" to save himself. Aster then proceeds to switch his "Dogma" into Attack Position and equip it with "Heavy Storm Blade". Aster attacks which surprises everyone, however doing so activates the effect of "Heavy Storm Blade", destroying every Spell and Trap on the field besides "Heavy Storm Blade". This weakens "Flare Neos" and "Dogma" then attacks it. However the attack doesn't go through and soon enough "Heavy Storm Blade" begins to crack (which shocks Aster). Jaden reveals that the set card Aster destroyed with "Heavy Storm Blade" was "Spell Calling" which allowed Jaden to set two face-down cards after it was destroyed. As such the attack backfires on Aster, destroying "Dogma" and winning Jaden the Duel. Due to Jaden's victory, the Slifer Red Dorm remains safe. Aster congratulates Jaden for his victory and Jaden states he won't count their first Duel as official to make things even for both of them, but Aster doesn't mind and leaves. Later Jaden and his friends watch Crowler duel Bonaparte to save the Slifer Red dorm. Though he gets worried about Bonaparte's skills, Crowler comes out the victor thus keeping the dorm safe. He then tells Crowler that maybe he may like his students, causing Crowler to deny it.

A few days after Jaden's defeat of Aster Phoenix, Jasmine, and Mindy come to see Alexis. They tell her, Jaden, Syrus, and Hassleberry about Chazz and the trouble he is causing at the dorm. When they get there, the entire dorm is painted white to represent the Society of Light. Chazz is standing at the front steps, along with the other Obelisks that he turned into members by beating them in a Duel. Atticus is there and he warns them about how Chazz has become a stronger Duelist since he joined the Society. Chazz explains that the Society is run by Sartorius, who Jaden remembered to be Aster Phoenix’s manager. Chazz says that Sartorius is more than that; Sartorius can help people see the light and that soon the whole world will see. Jaden cluelessly believes that they were exposed to lots of white paint fumes which causes Chazz and his groupees to react in shock and embarrassment. He angrily states that they are the crazy ones. Jaden wanted to challenge Chazz, but Alexis decides to do it because she feels it is right that she defend the Obelisks. Chazz and Alexis get ready to Duel in the arena, along with Jaden and the others and the new members of the Society. Chazz devastates Alexis with his new combos and ultimately wins the Duel. Alexis collapses to the ground and her friends run to her side to see if she is alright. She simply gets back up and says that she has seen the light. Chazz says that soon, everyone will, and become members of the Society of Light.

Later, Chazz chooses Lorenzo, the former world champion of the "Shooting Game" to Duel Jaden. Alexis lures Jaden to a planetarium in the white dorm causing Jaden to think that they are going on a date. Once he arrives the Duel takes place. Lorenzo plays a Boss Rush Deck and overpowers Jaden in the early stages of the Duel. He later reveals that Sartorius offered to make Lorenzo a Pro League Duelist if he could defeat Jaden. Ultimately however, he loses.

A few days later, Jaden Yuki is forced into a Duel against Professional Duelist and Society of Light member Howard X Miller, who the English version calls Sartorius' lawyer. X plays a Mill Deck, and his strategy revolves around destroying his opponent's Deck and causing them to lose when they can't draw a card. Jaden ultimately thwarts X's strategy using "Neo-Spacian Glow Moss" and ironically wins the Duel when X himself can't draw a card.

Sartorius, Aster's manager, challenges Hassleberry to a Duel, while promising to set Chazz back to normal should Hassleberry win. The Duel goes quite evenly, with both players being reduced to only a few hundred Life Points in a few turns. Sartorius wins by using "Reversal of Fate" to change the effects of his "Arcana Force" monsters. Despite his loss, Hassleberry is not converted to the Society of Light, much to Sartorius' shock. Hassleberry explains that in the past, he had excavated some Dinosaur fossils. His leg had been injured, and so the bone had been replaced by the fossilized Dinosaur bone he had uncovered. He claims that this "Dinosaur DNA" is what grants him immunity to the powers of Sartorius. A few days later, its revealed that Sartorius has officially enrolled at Duel Academy as a student much to Jaden's concern.

Duel Academy organizes a field trip sometime after Sartorius' enrollment at the academy. Dr. Crowler and Vice-Chancellor Bonaparte about where they will take the students. Sartorius and the large contingent of Obelisk Blue students that Chazz Princeton converted to the Society of Light enter the room. Sartorius wants to pick where they go, and he has most of the student population backing up his choice. Jaden enters the office while accompanied by Hassleberry, Bastion and Syrus. Jaden states he also has a place to recommend for the school trip, but the Society members order him to get lost until he is smart enough to join them. Jaden states he has equal chance of choosing as he is currently the #1 student in the school. It's determined that Jaden will Duel a Society member, with the winner being permitted to choose the trip destination (Sartorius also mentions if Jaden loses then he has to promise to join the Society of Light). Sartorius chooses Princess Rose to represent the Society of Light. She claims she can see Duel Spirits and that hers are three frog princes, referencing well-known fairy tales. Jaden ultimately wins the Duel, and announces that the field trip will be to Domino City, the site of the Battle City tournament.

Duel Academy's students arrive at Domino City for their field trip. Jaden, Syrus and Hassleberry purchase guidebooks to visit the city's landmarks. They visit the pier where Yugi Muto Dueled Joey Wheeler, while the latter was controlled by Marik Ishtar's Millennium Rod. They later arrive at Solomon Muto's Kame Game shop. They introduce themselves to Solomon, and upon explaining that they are from Duel Academy, he allows them to come inside, explaining that Yugi is probably off on another journey (in the dub, he says that Yugi "went to the market to get some olives three years ago"). He offers to be their tour guide for the rest of the day, and he takes them to the sites where Yugi Dueled Seeker and Strings. He lags behind as they continue to their next destination, and is kidnapped. Jaden locates Solomon and also meets up with Aster. Seeing the hologram of Hassleberry's "Dark Tyranno" on top of a building, they determine that he and Syrus must be there. Frost then finds Jaden, and wishes to take him to see Sarina, who Aster recognizes as Sartorius' younger sister.

Jaden arrives at the hotel where the Obelisk Blue/Society of Light students are staying, and is kicked out, along with Atticus. The Slifer Red students are forced to stay at an outdoor camp, and are only supplied food when Solomon brings them some. Blaze and T-Bone, two more of Sarina's enforcers, end up in the same camp as Jaden, though they don't realize who he is. They appear to get along just fine, and Jaden shares the food with them. They reveal that they themselves had once tried to enter Duel Academy, but failed the entrance exam. Despite this, they challenge Jaden to a Duel, still not aware who he is. T-Bone and Jaden are about to start their Duel when Sarina absorbs the soul of Blaze into one of her mirror cards while still back in her hideout. She tells T-Bone not to fail her, and forcibly places the "Monarch" cards of Blaze, Frost and Thunder into T-Bone's Deck. T-Bone uses the combined power of the "Monarchs" to Summon "Demiurge Ema", but ultimately loses when Jaden powers up "Elemental Hero Neos" using several Spell Cards. Sarina seals T-Bone's soul in a mirror as well, and reveals she's locked Syrus and Hassleberry in virtual pods. She states she'll be waiting at Kaiba Land for Jaden and Aster Phoenix.

After making their way to Kaiba Land and the Virtual World Facility within, Jaden and Aster are suddenly transported onto a digital plane, where they are reunited with Hassleberry (who has taken the form of a bandanna-wearing dinosaur) and Syrus (in the form of a "Vehicroid" resembling a Volkswagen Beetle), and also discover that the members of the Light Brigade are trapped here. Then, Sarina appears, explaining that she is acting under the orders of her brother, Sartorius, who wishes to discover the identity of the destined Duelist who is to be his final opponent, and Sarina is to Duel either Jaden or Aster to find the answer, but if Sarina's opponent loses, he must join Sartorius and the Society of Light. Jaden accepts the challenge, but convinces Sarina into a Tag-Team Duel. Sarina agrees, and splits herself in two for the face-off against Jaden and Aster. Aster is reluctant to accept, but decides that he must win to learn the truth about the death ("disappearance" in the English dub) of his father and the fate of an "Ultimate Destiny Hero" monster.

The Sarinas take an early advantage in the Duel, due to the fact that Aster refuses to cooperate with Jaden, while Jaden's moves are more about luck than strategy. Furthermore, the full moon behind Sarina's "Full Moon Mirror" seems to wane into a new moon with every monster that is destroyed, and once "Full Moon Mirror" gains its tenth Full Moon Counter, Sarina declares that the true test has now begun.

Sarina vs jaden
Jaden and Aster vs Sarina.

Sarina 1 unveils her strongest monster: By Tributing "Magic Mirror Spirit Asogi" and "Magic Mirror Spirit Nayuta" she Summons "Dark Creator" to the field and multiplies her monster tenfold, thanks to a Field Spell Card called "Infinite Fiend Mirror". After stating that only the Chosen Duelist can destroy her army of "Dark Creator" monsters, she attacks, but Jaden and Aster barely manage to survive her onslaught, because of Aster's "Elemental Recharge". However, as Sarina ends her turn without a direct attack, Jaden comes to realize that "Dark Creator" and the "Dark Creator Tokens" that were recently summoned cannot attack directly. Even though Aster manages to launch a counterattack with "Destiny Hero - Dasher", Sarina's "Dark Creator" has another surprise: it cannot be destroyed by battle. However, Jaden is able to use the effect of "Dasher" in the Graveyard to Special Summon his newest "Neo-Spacian" monster, "Dark Panther", and use it in a combo that brings out "Elemental Hero Dark Neos". "Dark Neos" is able to negate the effects of "Dark Creator", which, after "Dark Creator" is destroyed, undoes the effects of "Infinite Fiend Mirror". After the Duel, Sarina urges Jaden and Aster to save her brother from the control of the light.

When Jaden and his friends return to Duel Academy they find a girl named Alice who claims to be a transfer student. She helps the Slifers clean there room and makes them food, causing Hassleberry to fall in love with her. However, later that night Hassleberry disappears. Jaden goes to investigate and discovers Bastion unconscious under a tree in the forest. Bastion has no memory of how he got there, claiming he "must have blacked out" (It is indicated that Alice also kidnapped him). Together they find Hassleberry, and Alice appears (Cut from the dub is the scene of Alice walking on water). They learn that Alice has kidnapped Hassleberry, dragged him into a Duel (in the original Japanese version) and is using him as hostage to challenge other Duelists. She claims she posed as a transfer student of Slifer Red in order to seek out victims to plunge into darkness (In the dub, when asked by Jaden who she really is, she claims that she is "a disposable soul, just like everyone.")

She continues to issue several macabre statements until asked by Jaden why she's doing all this. She replies that all Duelists unleash despair on the world, and that she's here to change that. Alice justifies that all happiness is an illusion; and thus, she's here to erase that false happiness. In the Japanese version, Alice wants to crush all the light of hope from Duelists. She challenges Jaden to a "Duel of Despair," in which he replies it will be a "Duel of Hope".

At the beginning of the Duel, Alice displays a chilling sense of purpose, sacrificing her cards and Life Points without any hesitation so she can Summon her "Doll Chimera". As the Duel progresses, however, Alice's anger and bitterness slowly fades away to Jaden's cheery personality and the honesty of his happiness when he Duels. She starts to realize Dueling is actually fun. Jaden wins the duel causing Alice to turn back into a doll. She thanks Jaden for setting her free and disappears.

The following day, a Society of Light member, Bob Banter (who is in love Alexis Rhodes) Duels Jaden Yuki to prove himself worthy to be Alexis' boyfriend. Alexis only accepts under one condition. If Jaden loses, he will be reported for spying on her. Initially Chazz believes that Jaden will most certainly lose since some of Bob's cards involve the player to use their head, however this proves to be wrong as some of the challenges are physical challenges. Close to the end of the Duel, Bob activates "Quiz Panel - Obelisk 30" and Jaden recognizes the card. Bob realizes that was the card he dropped in front of Jaden earlier. Although Jaden at this point knew the entire answer to the question of the card, he ultimately chooses not to answer it completely because he considered it unfair for Bob and that since he knew the answer, it wouldn't be a challenge for him at all. In the end, Jaden wins the Duel after using a gamble of his own: "Secret Mission".

Later Jaden, Hassleberry and Syrus are shown trying to get Aster's steak, but are unsuccessful. Bastion later tells them how he feels weak as a duelist causing Jaden to tell him that he is still good and should not let the Society of Light bring him down. The following night he, Sryus and Hassleberry are about to have a campfire before Aster tells them about how Bastion went to the white dorm to duel Sartorius. When Jaden asks Aster if Bastion has a chance of defeating Sartorius, Aster replies that he does not. Aster states that even if Bastion could somehow win against Sartorius that he still wouldn't win, since although Bastion is a strong Duelist and wants to become stronger, Bastion also wants the people around him and his friends to recognize him. Jaden and his friends run off, and Aster soon appears after Bastion loses to Chazz, he confirms that Bastion let Chazz win and admits that Bastion's intellect would have been a tough opponent for Sartorius, but unfortunately Sartorius was still able to overcome him by preying on Bastion's newly developed anxiety. Later Jaden tries to cheer Syrus up when he gets worried about Zane's ruthless style of dueling.

When Chancellor Sheppard returns and announces the Genex Tournament, Jaden is excited and Syrus thinks that with any luck, Jaden will Duel many professionals. Sheppard specifies that the entire island will be the Duel arena and that each participant will receive one Genex Medallion. Participants must Duel at least once per day and are not permitted to decline the first person who challenges them each day. The winner will obtain all Genex Medallions owned by the loser. The final two medallion-holders will compete in the final match. Sheppard announces that the best veteran Duelists that he met in his travels will be arriving here shortly. He urges all of the students to do their best as he wishes the first Genex Champion to be from Duel Academy. He says there's a very special prize planned for the winner. Jaden leaps up, yelling for them to leave all the winning to him. Syrus comments that past history suggests the prize may be a kiss from Ms. Dorothy. Jaden looks around and Dorothy winks at him.

After Sheppard dismisses them, the students discuss the new development. Syrus says he heard a rumor that the number of medallions one collects will affect your grade, with Aster saying he doesn't care about that. Hassleberry muses that its all about survival. Jaden says he's fired up and asks if anyone wants to Duel now. Aster walks off, saying he'll watch to see how things develop for now. Jaden asks if he's trying to be a downer and turns to Hassleberry for a Duel. Hassleberry points out that he if he loses his first medallion, he'll be eliminated right away, then turns to Syrus and says he wants to take out the weakest competitor first anyway. Syrus turns to find himself surrounded by most of the school, who all see him as the weakest Duelist there. Syrus runs away and everyone present except Jaden give chase. Jaden wonders when the rest of the worldwide Duelists are getting here.

Later, Jaden is fishing at the harbor. He yawns, saying he's bored. He wonders if any outside Duelists have arrived yet, but hasn't seen any boats. Syrus and Hassleberry run up to him and Jaden asks why they look so happy. Syrus says he knew running away wasn't going to do any good, so he started by defeating a freshman red student and Hassleberry says he did the same with a second-year yellow. They both proudly show their newly-won Genex Medallions. Syrus asks why Hassleberry has to be such a show-off and the latter responds by asking if he wants to Duel now to settle it. Syrus declines, saying it's only the first challenge he's obligated to take, claiming he's tired. Hassleberry asks how many students Jaden defeated, who responds by saying none, since he was hoping to have his first opponent to be someone from outside Duel Academy. Syrus wonders if they're really coming. They hear a noise overhead as Prince Ojin's plane comes into view. It lands on top of the warehouse. The three rush to meet it. Hassleberry muses that he must be pretty important to arrive in such a large plane. Syrus sees the insignia on the side of the plane, saying it's the royal crest of the Misgarth Kingdom.

Jaden asks what that is and Syrus asks if Jaden never watches the news. Syrus says it's a small, isolated country, but they've launched SORA, a laser satellite that could burn the world down. He says he did hear that their first prince is a big fan of Duel Monsters though. He had announced on TV that he had passed his test to become a professional Duelist. Jaden says that now he know who his first opponent is. Jaden runs towards the plane, where Ojin is about to descend from with three bodyguards and Linda. Ojin tells his bodyguards to relax - the kid appears to be a challenger. Jaden is about to challenge Ojin when Sartorius appears, zapping Jaden with energy by touching his shoulder. Sartorius offers Jaden his apologies and says that Ojin's existence is unrelated to his destiny, as Chazz and Alexis arrives behind him. Sartorius declares that because of that, he will be Ojin's opponent. Jaden asks who decided that and Sartorius responds that the heavens did. Jaden asks him to hold on and Sartorius approaches Ojin, asking for a Duel. Jaden points out that he was the one who found him first and asks to Duel instead. Ojin asks which one of them is connected to the "D" cards. Jaden asks if he means the "Destiny Heroes" and Sartorius says that that would be him. Ojin concludes that Sartorius will be his opponent then. Sartorius says he is delighted and grateful. Jaden asks how Sartorius is linked to the "Destiny Heroes", insisting that that would be Aster. Sartorius wins easily without even using one turn and he obtains the controls to Misgarth's satellite. Jaden wonders what kind of Duels are in store for the rest of the tournament.

Pegasus in GX
Jaden meets Pegasus for the first time.

YGOGX085
Jaden faces off against the Egyptian God "The Winged Dragon of Ra."

The Genex Tournament is in full swing, but Jaden and his friends are in a slump—especially Jaden, since no challengers have approached him for a Duel. Meanwhile, Maximillion Pegasus and Chumley Huffington have arrived at Duel Academy from Industrial Illusions, searching for a stolen copy of the strongest Egyptian God Card, "The Winged Dragon of Ra". It is later discovered that a man named Franz has stolen the card, and then sneaked his way into the Genex Tournament. When Franz finds them, he challenges Pegasus to a Duel, stating that the winner will claim the stolen card. However, it's Jaden who ends up Dueling Franz, and must ultimately find a way to free "Ra" from a confining Field Spell that forces Ra to use its powers against its will. Following Franz's defeat, Pegasus explains to him that everyone can learn a lot from defeats and mistakes, while revealing the spot where his Millennium Eye once rested (before being stolen by Yami Bakura). When Pegasus offers Franz back his position in Industrial Illusions, Franz readily accepts, and returns to Industrial Illusions with Pegasus and Chumley.

Later, Jaden Duels Orlando as part of the Genex Tournament. Orlando is a Kabuki stage actor and Professional Cosplay Duelist. Jaden defeats Orlando and reminds him Dueling is more about fun than it is about performing.

One day, Chazz Princeton defeats Gelgo, a Professional Duelist and wins his numerous Genex Medallions using his "White Knight" Deck. He challenges Jaden to a Duel, to take place the next day. Jaden asks why Chazz isn't using his "Ojama" cards, and Chazz responds that he has no idea what Jaden is talking about, but then says he vaguely recalls throwing out cards like that the the other day and thinks they landed in the ocean. Jaden goes to the ocean by the shore, trying to find Chazz's "Ojama" cards. Later, Jaden is rebuilding his Deck for his Duel with Chazz and the spirit of Lyman Banner contacts him. After questioning where he came from, Banner reveals that as his spirit attempted to pass on the afterlife, it was eaten by Pharaoh. He says he can't sleep because he is hearing a strange voice. His spirit leads Jaden to the well where Chazz had originally found "Ojama Black" and "Ojama Green". The three "Ojama" cards are there. They all beg Jaden to save them from the crabs that are attempting to cut them.

The Ojama Trio asks if Jaden can help Chazz; and feel that if they returned to him at this point, he would just throw them away again. Jaden offers to put the Trio in his Deck for his Duel with Chazz, which they accept, being excited about being able to fight beside Heroes. The next, day, Chazz and Jaden meet outside the main entrance to Duel Academy's main building, with Jaden bringing Chazz's old black uniform along with him. Chazz reaffirms his devotion to the Society of Light, but mentally feels strange at seeing the jacket, as some of his former memories return to him. Chazz dominates the early stages of the Duel, and Jaden is reduced to 400 Life Points. Eventually Jaden uses an "Ojama" combo to defeat him and reminds Chazz that he only listens to himself and ultimately removes him from the control of the Society of Light.

A while later, Jaden is challenged to a Duel by Lucien Grimley from North Academy, who is revealed to be able to use the power of "The Grim Reaper" to win his Duels, in exchange for his soul. During the Duel, Jaden manages to survive Lucien's One Turn Kill strategy, as Lucien's ace card, "Slash Draw", can destroy all of Jaden's cards and damage Jaden for every card he controls. Jaden later discovers that Lucien had lost faith in his Decklong ago and sold his soul to "The Grim Reaper", if the monster spirit helped Lucien win all his Duels. After the two battle through Lucien soon sees that he had always loved his Deck and seeing Jaden's faith in his Deck he throws the Grim Reaper card to fight on his own. He switches his arm to avoid using the power of the Grim Reaper. In the end, Lucien loses the Duel, but not before regaining faith in himself, which results in him breaking his deal with "The Grim Reaper" and deciding to Duel of his own free will. Jaden later helped Crowler and Bonaparte function as a team during there triangle duel against Pegasus. Though the two lose, they admit that the students taught them a lot much to Jaden's happiness.

One night, the good Sartorius appears from a beam of light and gives Jaden a small black case, telling him to protect it and not to return it to him. He then uses his mind control powers on Jaden so that he doesn't give whatever is in the case back to him, which turns out to be one of the keys to SORA. The Light of Destruction then brainwashes Alexis and tells her to get the satellite key back from Jaden so she challenges him to a Duel using her new White Night deck. Jaden wins and frees her from the control of the Society of Light.

Meanwhile, Syrus is in the hospital, recovering from his Duel with his brother Zane, when he and Jaden hear an announcement over the P.A. system that Jaden has to take a physics pop quiz. Being the test-hater that he is, Jaden is reluctant to go through with it. However, the "announcement" was merely a recording of Dr. Crowler's voice, played back over the P.A. system by Prince Ojin. And when Jaden enters the classroom, he discovers that he is alone, until Dr. Eisenstein appears on the stage before him. Dr. Eisenstein uses his logical Dueling knowledge to overpower Jaden, balancing the power of his monsters, Spells and Traps to deal significant damage to Jaden. But Jaden, who believes that he'll keep drawing the cards he needs, manages to come out on top with a strong counterattack. Upon defeat, Eisenstein is convinced that faith in chance can help win a Duel. With Hassleberry and Crowler waiting outside watching, Jaden is happy to report that he passed his pop quiz. Then Crowler reminds him that no one is giving classes or tests while the Genex Tournament is still in progress. Jaden realizes that he was tricked into Dueling Eisenstein.

Due to Jaden's victories over Alexis Rhodes (freed from Sartorius's influence) and Dr. Eisenstein, and Aster Phoenix's victory over The D (lost in the explosion of his yacht), the Light of Destruction steps up its plans to destroy Earth. It fragments once again from Sartorius's body and possesses Prince Ojin, who challenges Jaden to a Duel for control of his key to SORA. While Jaden manages to survive Ojin's One Turn Kill and rally his "Elemental Heroes" to destroy one of Ojin's "Satellite Cannons", the Prince merely shrugs this off as a minor setback and reveals the most powerful monster his Deck can produce—the "Satellite Laser Balsam", a "Satellite" monster with a Piercing effect, and one that would gain 3000 attack points with each of Ojin's passing turns. But even this is not enough to win Ojin the Duel, as Jaden is able to mount a comeback with "Change of Hero - Reflector Ray".

Unfortunately, although Ojin has been defeated, the Light of Destruction (still possessing Sartorius) has not abandoned its goal. Now, it decides to target Aster and claim his key, in an ultimate attempt to claim both, gain full control of SORA, and make the world "see the light".

After defeating The D and escaping with "Destiny Hero - Plasma" and his life, Aster Phoenix heads to the Society of Light's dormitory, intending to save Sartorius from The Light, by challenging The Light, to a Duel Aster wagers his key. Aster makes a dramatic turnaround and attempts to win the Duel with "Plasma", but is ultimately defeated as The Light of Destruction unleashes "Arcana Force EX - The Light Ruler". Jaden, angered by this heartless victory, challenges Sartorius, with the fate of the entire world at stake. Sartorius places Aster's unconscious form on one hand of the goddess statue and his Satellite Key on the other. The statue acts as a set of scales. Unless Jaden Yuki places his own key on the hand, the scale will be imbalanced and Aster will fall into the pit of lava below. Sartorius activates the statue, and the hand holding Aster beings to lower. If Jaden hands over the key, Sartorius will have access to the Satellite and be able to brainwash the whole world (destroy the world in the Japanese version). It's Aster's life against the world's. Breaking free from the good Sartorius mind control power that he placed on him to prevent him from giving him back the key and choosing the safety of a friend, Jaden throws his key onto the other hand and so the scale tips back into balance which saved Aster for now.

Series103
Jaden vs Sartorius

Elemental Hero Neos manifests before Jaden and explains that the source of every battle is a confrontation between light and dark. Neos says Jaden is the only one with the power of "gentle power of the Darkness of Justice" to save the world from The Light of Destruction. Jaden challenges Sartorius to a Duel for the satellite keys. Sartoruis states he has no reason to Duel Jaden, since he's already given up his key. Sartorius sends a beam of light at the keys to retrieve them, but the beam is blocked by a multicolored beam from space. Neos is protecting the keys. This forces Sartorius to Duel Jaden for them. Jaden gains an early advantage, reducing Sartorius to 300 Life Points with "Shining Flare Wingman". However, Sartorius activates "Light Barrier" which surrounds the field, suppressing Neos' power. Sartorius retrieves the keys and influences Prince Ojin once more, giving him the keys and telling him to run an activate the satellite. With the keys gone, the hand holding Aster lowers towards the lava. Hassleberry runs in and barely manages to save Aster's life. Ojin rushes off to activate the satellite, and Hassleberry chases after him with Linda, leaving Syrus Truesdale to tend to Aster and support Jaden. Sartorius' "Light Barrier" card negates the effects of all non-Arcana Force monsters, allows Sartorius to choose which effect all such monsters get, and add the ATK of any monsters that either player destroys to their Life Points. During the Duel, Jaden has a vision of his own future, with himself standing in a desert. He's attacked by a shadowy armored figure, but this gives him confidence, as this future implies that the world is not destroyed, and that he wins against Sartorius, despite the fact that this implies a bleak future for him. When Jaden summons "Elemental Hero Neos", it tells him that if he wins the Duel, he may be able to stop the satellite. Jaden manages to destroy "Light Barrier", allowing Neos to leave the area. After attacking directly with "Elemental Hero Glow Neos", its Duel Spirit leaves with that of Hassleberry to destroy the satellite.

GX episode 104
Jaden in space.

When Jaden re-summons "Elemental Hero Neos" using "Hero Flash!!", the spirit of Glow Neos remains at the satellite, while a separate spirit of regular Neos returns to the Duel. After Jaden activates "Neo Space" and Summons "Elemental Hero Neos" again, "Neos" rejoins Hassleberry. Sarina is able to stop the satellite from firing at Neos and Hassleberry, and this allows them to demolish it completely. Jaden defeats Sartorius with "Reverse of Neos," and The Light of Destruction leaves the latter's body. Sartorius reveals that The Light of Destruction took his fortune-telling abilities with it when it exited his body. He therefore allows his tarot cards to blow away in the wind. After that, a KaibaCorphelicopter shows up, with Sarina aboard, alive and well.

Dimension World
During the third year, Jaden is pursued by the spirit of his favorite card in childhood, Yubel, which was given to him by his father, in both versions he doesn't remember who Yubel is due to his medical treatment done on him during his childhood until it reveals its physical form. With his parents always working and away from home, Jaden turned to Dueling friends to pass the time, but the sadness associated with his inability to play "Yubel" properly led the Duel Monster to hospitalize a young Duelist named Osamu and scare away the rest of his companions with other misfortunes. During this time, he develops a close friendship with North Academy champion Jesse Anderson, as the two found they had much in common.

Duel Academy is transported to an alternate dimension where Duel Monsters can take physical form, and Jesse ultimately appears to sacrifice himself to grant the rest of the school passage back to their own world. Depressed at the loss of Jesse, and blaming himself for it Jaden willingly attempts to go back to the alternate dimension, taking a group of his insistent friends with him, though they end up in another, desperate dimension. However, Jaden's guilt for Jesse's situation soon leads to an obsession. He begins to think only of finding and saving Jesse and begins to disregard what his actions may make befall his other friends. Because of this, his friends Alexis Rhodes, Tyranno Hassleberry, Chazz and Atticus Rhodes all get captured and sacrificed by Brron, Mad King of Dark World in order to create the "Super Polymerization" card. When Jaden finally wins against Brron, Syrus, Axel Brodie and Jim Crocodile Cook arrive. Witnessing the others being sacrificed because of Jaden's obsession to rescue Jesse causes them to abandon him, leaving him alone.

HaouJuudai
Jaden as the Supreme King in the Dimension World.

Afterwards, Jaden feels guilty at himself for allowing the sacrifices to happen. A strange figure called the Supreme King enters, influencing his reincarnation to become evil and saying he will never be able to redeem himself for his actions. With all his friends gone, Jaden unwillingly accepts it along with the incomplete "Super Polymerization" card and at that time, the Supreme King possesses him. While under the Supreme King's control, Jaden commits many atrocities that include unrepentant slaughter of Duelists in order to complete the "Super Polymerization" and the oppression of several villages. However, as the Supreme King performs these actions, Jaden himself is left in doubt about what he needs in order to be complete not only as a Duelist, but as a person. Unfortunately, he turns to the Supreme King for this advice, who only tells him that one can only overcome evil by becoming evil. After Axel uses Jim's Eye of Orichalcum on the Supreme King during a successful invasion of the Supreme King's castle, Jaden is freed from his possession, but is deeply tormented by the atrocities he committed during his possession, and he thus starts refusing to use his Fusion Monsters, as "Polymerization" and other cards that include Fusion Summoning remind him of the things he did while possessed, since the Supreme King mainly used Fusion Monsters.

Zane tries to Duel Jaden to snap him out of his guilty mindset and get him focused on stopping Yubel, but he only continues doubting himself more and feeling worse. Then Jesse reappears, though he is possessed by Yubel. Learning that his friend is being controlled, Jaden puts his problems aside for the time being so that he can save Jesse. However, when Jaden finally Duels Yubel to save Jesse, it is revealed that Yubel actually removed Jesse's soul from his body and placed him inside the "Rainbow Dark Dragon" before taking over. Jaden manages to exorcise Yubel out of Jesse, but in one foul swoop, it snatches the "Super Polymerization" card from Jaden and then forces him into a Duel. Before the final clash, Jaden finds out that Yubel's power was previously augmented by the Light of Destruction while it was still stranded in space. Although he feels guilty because his actions led to Yubel's exposure, the sheer atrocity and shamelessness of its actions prevents Jaden from feeling any sympathy towards the deranged spirit.

However, near the end of the Duel, Jaden is told the truth between his connections with Yubel: Instead of just being a part of him, Jaden is the next Supreme King, the reincarnation of a young prince of an unknown kingdom from long ago, who was once friends with a human Yubel. As the Supreme King contained the enigmatic power of a being called the Supreme King that is needed to defeat the Light of Destruction, he needed a guardian to protect him until he was old enough to control and wisely use his power; Yubel chose herself for the role, and was transformed into the Duel Monster it eventually became, its effect allowing for the perfect defense against anyone who tried to harm Jaden. Despite the great burden and sacrifice, the young Supreme King promised to give his love (friendship in the dub) only to Yubel, which was why Yubel became Jaden's favorite card as a kid, and why Yubel was so obsessed and jealous with him and his friends.

GX155 - Yubel hugs Jaden
Jaden being embraced by a redeemed Yubel shortly before their fusion.

Finally realizing the truth behind all his troubles, Jaden - after bidding adieu to his friends - allowed Yubel to gain a hold of "Super Polymerization," chaining "Spiritual Fusion" to choose their souls as the fusion materials instead of all twelve dimensions as Yubel was expecting, and purging Yubel of the Light of Destruction's influence. Vowing to never stop caring for each other, Yubel and Jaden are bound together for all time. Jaden supposedly left to battle of the light waves of chaos(This was where the dub of the show ended), and fulfill the mission Yubel was given in the past. After Jaden's disappearance and everyone else being returned back to Duel Academy, Syrus, Hassleberry, Atticus, Chazz, and Alexis were talking about Jaden. After the talk, Syrus sees a shooting star and wishes Jaden to be back, which happened as the "star" crashed at Duel Academy, and was revealed that it was Jaden, with the abilities of both the Supreme King and Yubel under his control.

Darkness
After the events that happened in season 3, Jaden has became very withdrawn and independent (though his cheerful personality was still here). Syrus is now in the Obelisk Blue dorm, and he is the only remaining student at Slifer Red. He now spends most of his time alone, feeling too distanced from his friends after what had happened. He decides to leave Duel Academy, not wishing to put his friends in danger (he had come to believe that things that put his friends in danger happened because of him being around). However, both Sartorius and Kagemaru attempt to convince him otherwise, believing that he is needed on the island to prevent a growing danger in the near future. This seems to be well-advised, as before their meeting, Jaden already confronts a mysterious Obelisk Blue student by name of Yusuke Fujiwara, who can hypnotize people and set fires with his eyes, as well as the mysterious entity Trueman, who seems to want both Jaden and Fujiwara dead. Both of these entities noticed Jaden showing Yubel's power and commented that he is not a regular human.

Jaden eventually regained his love for Dueling while teaming with Alexis in a Tag Duel. While Dueling alongside her, he also made amends with her and repaired their friendship, making him more open to his friends again.

Eventually, Jaden learns that the person that everyone thought was Fujiwara was actually the spirit of one of his cards, Honest, and that Fujiwara doesn't even appear to be on earth. Although Jaden doesn't know what Trueman's intentions are, he has found that the enigmatic dark entity pulls people into the world of Darkness. He realizes this too late, having been distracted by Trueman's actions in Domino City, thus giving the real Nightshroud, using Yusuke Fujiwara's body as a vessel, to attack the students at Duel Academy, only arriving in time to see Nightshroud possessed Fujiwara defeat the last student, Atticus Rhodes. Along the way, Jaden meets Jesse in Domino City, but mistakes him for Trueman after Sartorius infected his "Polymerization" card. After a Duel they fail to finish, Jaden realises it is Jesse and not Trueman he's Dueling and the two of them return to Duel Academy together. Both are then challenged to a triple Duel with Nightshroud, with only Jaden remaining the winner after he purges Nightshroud from Fujiwara. However, Jaden Duels the bodiless Nightshroud in a final Duel with the world at stake. The Duel was intense straight from the start; with Jaden Summoning "Neos Wiseman" using "Yubel." Jaden finally defeats Nightshroud by summoning "Elemental Hero Divine Neos" to defeat Nightshroud's "Darkness Neosphere."

YuGiOhGXEpisode180 PIC final letter
The letter Pharaoh had for Jaden.

After the graduation ceremony, Jaden decides to leave Duel Academy quietly; however, he is brought to the room that contains Yugi's Deck by Winged Kuriboh. Yugi appears there, and after the Winged Kuriboh card glows with a bright light, Jaden finds himself in Domino City in the past, bumping into a younger Yugi who still holds the Millennium Puzzle. He challenges his hero to a Duel, and as he shuffles the Deck he senses the presence of the Egyptian Gods in Yugi's Deck. The Duel then begins, with Yugi eventually Summoning "Dark Magician" and Jaden Summoning "Elemental Hero Neos", their ace monsters, which battle it out. After a long battle, Yami Yugi finally takes over Yugi's body and welcomes Jaden, and Summons "Slifer the Sky Dragon". Jaden's face lights up, and he finally realizes Dueling really is fun. He then sends "Elemental Hero Neos" to attack "Slifer The Sky Dragon" and the Duel comes to an abrupt end with Jaden, Yami and Yugi all smiling. It then pans to Jaden in a desert. Jaden then turns around and looks at the sky, and thanks Yugi for reminding him that he has a long way to go, and Dueling is fun, and shouts his very last "Gotcha!" towards the sun. His bag rustles, and he opens it to find Pharaoh and Banner inside. Inside Pharaoh's collar he finds a letter from his friends each with their own message for him feeling glad that they love him. After reading it, Jaden, Banner, Pharaoh, and presumably Yubel decide to travel together, and thus Jaden runs off towards the sunset, off to start a new adventure.
Relationships
Winged Kuriboh
Jaden is closest mostly to his monster spirits of which he possess to the gift of communication with, such as his Neo-Spacians, but no monster spirit is closest to his heart than his main spirit partner, Winged Kuriboh.

Bastion Misawa
Bastion was also one of Jaden's friends, an avid physics enthusiast and a very determined player who always aspired to be the best, but later realized that Friendship was also a way to have fun.

Syrus Truesdale
Syrus Truesdale and Jaden first met at the entrance exam and later they became best friends at Duel Academy. Jaden believes in Syrus even when he lacks confidence in himself. An example of this is when they are both forced to Duel the Paradox Brothers, Jaden motivates Syrus even though Syrus feels he will just be a burden. Jaden also cares deeply for Syrus and enjoys his company. This is shown when he rejects a promotion to Ra Yellow simply because "Syrus wouldn't be there." In the third season, Syrus loses faith in Jaden after watching their friends' Alexis, Chazz, Hassleberry and Atticus being sacrificed partly due to Jaden's fault. These feelings are aggravated even more due to orb of doubt planted in Syrus' mind by the evil Zure, Knight of Dark World. But later he realizes that it wasn't entirely Jaden's fault and starts supporting him again. After Jaden initially leaves with Yubel, Syrus seems to be the person who misses Jaden the most and immediately cries tears of joy when he sees Jaden return. In the Japanese version, Syrus looks up to Jaden as a "big brother", resulting in a rivalry with Tyranno Hassleberry.

Alexis Rhodes
Alexis Rhodes has always shown interest in Jaden and his Dueling skills. They share a lot in common, like the same passion for Dueling.[55] Along the series they become very close friends, willing to support each other in the most difficult times. An example of this is when Alexis risks her life to accompany Jaden to the dimensional world in order to help him look for Jesse. Another example is when Jaden Duels Alexis to free her from the control of Sartorius. Later, after the events of the third arc, their relationship becomes awkward and this troubles Alexis greatly. She keeps reminiscing about how things were during their first year at Duel academy. She wishes that Jaden would return to his old fun-loving personality and start smiling like he used to before. Their relationship is finally repaired during the Pair Dueling Tournament when Alexis reminds Jaden that he used to love Dueling. After some time, during their final pair Duel, Jaden states that he's grateful to have met her and also claims her 'bold' combo of using "Doble Passe" was his first impression of her. During the course of the tournament, Alexis realizes she has feelings for Jaden and decided to tell him after they had won, but decides not to go through with it. Later, during the graduation party, she thinks about everything that has changed since their first year and feels that "Jaden has changed the most."

Chazz Princeton
Though originally Jaden's main rival, Chazz eventually becomes a close friend. Jaden considered them to be friends much earlier than Chazz did. Though their rivalry continues, they form a bond to their shared battles in various arcs. Chazz is even willing to accompany Jaden into the other dimensions to help find Jesse. By the end of the show, Chazz respects Jaden as a Duelist and writes to him saying whenever he wants they can duel.

Tyranno Hassleberry
Hassleberry enters Duel Academy when Jaden is in his second year. After being defeated, he quickly develops into a rival for Syrus, even calling Jaden "big brother" ("Sarge" in the dub) just as Syrus does. Syrus and Hassleberry would later form a rivalry over who is Jaden's closest friend.

Blair Flannigan
Blair originally had a crush on Zane, but her fixation shifted to Jaden after being defeated by him, much to his shock and displeasure.[31] In the third season, it is shown that Jaden cared for her as a friend even going as far of getting medicines for her in their somewhat dangerous situation after being attacked by Yubel then gaining a mysterious illness, however she is later cured by the medicine from a nearby submarine. The two of them also co-operated well as a tag team.

Zane Truesdale
Zane with Alexis - along with the remainder of the academy students - watched Jaden's entrance exam duel against Crowler which ended in Jaden being victorious, while Alexis was impressed, Zane didn't seem to share the same views towards the new enrolling student, possibly implying that he is worried that Jaden's success would outrank him.[1]

Later on throughout his first academic year, after defeating Zane's brother Syrus in a practice duel for their upcoming Tag Team Duel, Jaden looking at Syrus' hand after the duel notices that it contained Power Bond which Syrus could have used to double his Steam Gyroid's attack points and beaten Jaden.[Notes 1][21] Syrus tells Jaden that his brother gave him the card and told him that he wasn't good enough to use it. Alexis tells Jaden that Syrus' brother is called Zane and is the school's top duelist. Despite Zane's reputation and popularity, Jaden has never heard of him, but is eager to duel him, curious to know the issues between the two Trusedale brothers and more importantly and personally, see if he can beat the school's number one pupil. Alexis tries to warn Jaden, but encourages him to go through with it when realising that his mind was already made up.[21] The next day, after hunting Syrus down with Chumley and stopping the former from leaving the academy, the three slifers encounter Alexis with Zane who is relieved to see his brother dropping out. Jaden angry with Zane's disloyalty towards his brother, challenges him to a Duel; Zane accepts believing that he can beat him at ease, though he probably was also eager to defeat the student who beat Crowler. During the Duel, Jaden mocks Zane when destroying his Cyber Dragon with Elemental Hero Thunder Giant, saying that the latter made the big man on campus get a little bit smaller, but he also compliments him in his ability to maintain calm without worrying or retaliating to his opponent's attacks, Zane compliments Jaden as well, saying that he himself is also a good duelist and plays his cards well, much to Syrus' surprise as Zane rarely gives compliments. Although Jaden manages to counter some of Zane's most powerful forces throughout the duel and maintain a lead over him, Zane eventually beats him with Cyber End Dragon in combination with Power Bond. Jaden does not take losing to harshly and thanks Zane for a great duel, the two duelist walk away feeling impressed with their opponent; it is implied that the two developed a fondness in each other an admiration for each other as duelists from that day on, Zane was more than likely especially impressed that another duelist came that close to beating him.[22]

Zane was originally elected to represent Duel Academy in the School Duel against North Academy, but when word got out that North Academy were using a first year student as their representative Duel Academy then had to choose a first year student of their own in the spirit of competition, and with Zane being a third year student was off limits. When wondering who the first year representative should be, Zane recommends Jaden assuring Chancellor Sheppard that he will make the academy proud.[4]

Jesse Anderson
When Jesse first came to Duel Academy, Jaden was fast friends with him because of how they were able to communicate Duel Spirits and share similar personalities. Also, when they met at the roof, they both had a feeling that they had met somewhere earlier. When Duel Academy returned to its home dimension, Jaden risked his life to go to another world to get him back. During the triangle duel between Jesse, Jaden and Nightshroud, Nightshroud looks into Jesse to find his darkness; said darkness was shown to be his distaste for Jaden. Jesse plays along with it and then jokes with Jaden about it, seemingly tricking Nightshroud. Moments later, Jesse's internal monologue informs us that Nightshroud was indeed right; but he owes Jaden his life after saving him from Yubel back in the other dimension. Nightshroud also clearly did not create this narrative, because the only person to ever have no darkness within them was Tyranno Hassleberry, in which he created a darkness just to manipulate him. This differs from the darkness within Jesse, because his was not fabricated, and instead, it was a very real thing that Jesse felt. In Yu-Gi-Oh! 3D Bonds Beyond Time, seeing that Jesse's "Rainbow Dragon" card was used for "Malefic Rainbow Dragon", Jaden, furious at this, cursed Paradox for that action.

Yubel
Yubel was the spirit of a card Jaden owned in his youth.[12] The card was given to Jaden by his father who was rarely around due to his long work hours. This caused Jaden to greatly value it, and in doing so formed a close bond with the card’s spirit. Due to a promise made to Jaden's past life, Yubel protected him at any cost, wishing to safeguard him from all threats. This caused Yubel to become very overprotective and possessive of Jaden. Eventually, she started putting several of his neighborhood dueling opponents into comas. Jaden's past life held romantic feelings for Yubel and pledged his love to her and her alone (all aspects of this are removed in the dub). She returns to seek out Jaden years later, wishing for him to make due on his past life's promise at any cost (in the dub, she wants revenge for being sent away). Every action she takes is to get closer to Jaden and believes that everything she does is out of love, no matter how heinous the action. Jaden eventually accepts her feelings seemingly because if he didn't she would continue killing people he cares about and fuses himself with her via "Super Polymerization".[56]

Naruto:
--------------------------------------------
Naruto Uzumaki  is a shinobi of Konohagakure's Uzumaki clan. He became the jinchūriki of the Nine-Tails on the day of his birth — a fate that caused him to be shunned by most of Konoha throughout his childhood. After joining Team Kakashi, Naruto worked hard to gain the village's acknowledgement all the while chasing his dream to become Hokage. In the following years, through many hardships and ordeals, he became a capable ninja, regarded as a hero both by the villagers, and soon after, the rest of the world, becoming known as the Hero of the Hidden Leaf  He soon proved to be one of the main factors in winning the Fourth Shinobi World War, Naruto lost his right arm after the Fourth Shinobi World War, though it is later replaced by a fully manoeuvrable prosthetic arm made of Hashirama Senju's cells, wrapped completely in bandages. In The Last: Naruto the Movie, Naruto grew again to be one of the tallest of his graduating class, cut his hair short, and wore a black elastic forehead protector. Over his pants and sandals, he wears a black uniform jacket with an orange zipper and buttons on the waist and sleeves, which can be folded up at times. He has a red armband with an Uzumaki crest on his left arm.
Chakra and Physical Prowess
Naruto gives Hinata power
Naruto sharing Kurama's chakra through physical contact.

As an Uzumaki and a reincarnation of Asura Ōtsutsuki,[66] Naruto has massive reserves of strong chakra. Even as a child, he had at least four times the amount of a seasoned Jōnin like Kakashi Hatake,[67] and described by Karin as "bright and warm".[68] Additionally, when Minato sealed Kurama within Naruto as an infant, he constructed the seal in a way that allowed a portion of the fox's immense chakra to naturally mix with Naruto's chakra over time.[69][70] His initial poor control of it was offset by his sheer reserves,[71] which were large enough to endure three and a half days of constant battle against several powerful opponents. Only by the end of his battle against Sasuke did he show exhaustion, and even then could still fight to a standstill and eventual victory.[72] aruto's control improved greatly over time; able to transfer his chakra to others,[73] and perform one-handed hand seals.[74] Being an Uzumaki, Naruto's powerful life-force grants him an extreme longevity, healing power, stamina, and vitality;[75] this allowed him to survive the extraction of a tailed beast, though he required aid from Sakura Haruno to stay alive.[76] Naruto also learned how to counter genjutsu from Jiraiya, but his ability to do so is limited.[77] 
While naturally a short-range fighter, Naruto originally was inept at taijutsu, requiring unpredictable attacks to surprise combat experts like Kiba Inuzuka and Neji Hyūga.[82][83] He often utilised shadow clones in large if not massive numbers to simply overwhelm his foes.[84] Although these tactics resumed later, Naruto becomes much more adept at taijutsu due to Jiraiya's training.[85] After Fukasaku's tutelage, he could fend off a pair of expert kenjutsu users.[86][87][88] Two years after the war, Naruto's taijutsu prowess could best dozens of opponents without shadow clones or enhancements.[21] 
Body Modifications
Shinobi Ware Absorption
Naruto's prototype Absorbing Hand.

After losing his right arm during his final battle with Sasuke, Tsunade cultured an artificial prosthesis for him using the cells of Hashirama Senju. As his body and the prosthesis arms are only connected through his chakra itself he can easily remove and replace them.[91]
Jinchūriki Transformations
Main articles: Jinchūriki Forms, Nine-Tails Chakra Mode and Baryon Mode
Version 1 form
Naruto's Version 1 form.

Originally as the jinchūriki of Kurama's Yang half, Naruto had access to massive reserves of exceptionally powerful chakra, which was at least a hundredfold greater than Kakashi's.[67] These chakra levels were increased even further when the Yin half of Kurama was reunited with the Yang half inside of Naruto. Due to his inheriting his mother's unique chakra capacities and being Kurama's jinchūriki for essentially his entire life, Naruto's chakra had become naturally compatible with the fox's,[92] allowing him to perform several chakra-taxing techniques unhindered. Originally, he could only access Kurama's chakra in times of great anger. It enhanced Naruto's abilities, but the fox's negative influence made Naruto more aggressive. While essentially remaining himself when accessing a Version 1 state, manifesting four tails would trigger Version 2 state, which made him lose control and would gradually turn into even more feral forms, requiring outside assistance to suppress Kurama's power and regain control, prompting him to avoid relying on the fox's power whenever possible. By the end of the Fourth Great Shinobi War, he could access his Version 1 form without any loss in his mentality.[93]

Naruto transforming
Naruto transforming from his Nine-Tails Chakra Mode into his Kurama Mode.

Realising he could not avoid using Kurama's power, Naruto sought to control it with help from Killer B, a jinchūriki who had fully mastered the power of Gyūki. Upon succeeding and taking most of Kurama's chakra, Naruto attained the Nine-Tails Chakra Mode, which greatly increased his physical parameters. Naruto can also detect negative emotions in this mode, and use Tailed Beast Chakra Arms from any part of his body as he pleases, as well as form Tailed Beast Balls from them. As he didn't have Kurama's cooperation, Naruto needed to exercise extreme caution while using the form, as the chakra exchange could cost him his life. Eventually, when Kurama acknowledged Naruto's life-long strength of character and Naruto learned the fox's true name, their new-found friendship granted Naruto access to its full power, which further increased his physical parameters and with no drawbacks. This also increased his resilience to such degrees to the point where he could survive the Ten-Tails' Tenpenchii and endure Toneri's Golden Wheel Reincarnation Explosion — which was able to cut the Moon in half — with no visible signs of damage. This cooperation of Kurama also provides Naruto with an immediate resistance from genjutsu. Two years later, he could store Kurama's chakra within his arm to deliver powerful punches capable of creating massive craters on the Moon and depower Toneri from his Tenseigan Chakra Mode to his normal state, as well as block the latter's Golden Wheel Reincarnation Explosion.

Naruto's tailed beast mode
Naruto's Tailed Beast Mode.

Failing to transform into a replica of Kurama at first, Naruto instead achieved a Tailed Beast Mode in the unique form of a life-sized transparent avatar of chakra. In it, he could create Tailed Beast Balls and revitalise the life-forces of any he touches physically or with the avatar,[94][95] heal nearly any wounds,[38] or grant them temporarily chakra-cloaks.[96] After he became the jinchūriki of Kurama's complete self, Naruto is able to manifest the demon fox outside himself for a period akin to summoning, allowing both to fight as separate entities. During the endgame of the Fourth Shinobi World War, Naruto received chakra from the other tailed beasts,[97] which greatly increased his chakra reserves even further and allowed him to access their unique abilities himself, such as Shukaku's sand manipulation, Saiken's soap bubble ninjutsu and ability to emit corrosive liquids, Chōmei's scale powder, or Gyūki's ink creation, and infuse them into his own techniques. With the infusion of all nine of the tailed beasts' respective chakra inside of him, Naruto has become a medium to connect all the tailed beasts to communicate with each other[98] and made him a human pillar for the power of the Ten-Tails.[99] In the Academy, the Sexy Technique was the only technique that Naruto could perform successfully, which had no practical use other than to shock people. Later, he learned more advanced and useful ninjutsu from Jiraiya. This included summoning toads from Mount Myōboku to assist him, and use them to crush enemies from above. He became skilled in shurikenjutsu, able to throw weapons quickly and with precision.[103] Naruto's repertoire expanded to fūinjutsu, where he could store his weapons within scrolls. His fūinjutsu was further increased upon receiving Gerotora near the start of the Fourth Shinobi World War.[104] In the anime, Jiraiya taught Naruto cooperation ninjutsu, combining his techniques with others to create an even more powerful one.[105] The collaboration techniques he performed with other individuals typically utilised his own elemental affinity, such as the Typhoon Water Vortex Technique with Yamato, the Wind Release: Toad Gun with Gamatatsu, and the Scorch Release: Halo Hurricane Jet Black Arrow Style Zero with Sasuke. He also learned from Asuma Sarutobi to flow chakra into his weapons to increase their offensive might.[106]
Shadow Clone Technique
Multiple Shadow Clone Technique

See also: Images of Naruto using Shadow Clone Technique
Naruto's first trademark technique was the Shadow Clone Technique. While originally failing constantly with a basic illusionary clone, after briefly studying the Scroll of Seals, he learned to create shadow clones on a mass scale. From then on, Naruto's skill with shadow clones blossomed to great heights. Having unusually high chakra reserves, Naruto could use this technique to create hundreds of shadow clones and retain large amounts of chakra in each one with relative ease.[109] He could use them to outnumber or deceive his enemies, manoeuvre himself in mid-air, transform into weapons, scout areas, or test an opponent's abilities.[110] During his elemental-affinity training, learning that the original will gain all the knowledge and conditioning of a shadow clone right after it dispersed. From this, Naruto can use his mass scale of clones to drastically speed up his training to gain years worth of experience in just days. aruto's second trademark technique is the Rasengan. Originally, due to his poor chakra control, Naruto had to use a shadow clone to form the spherical shape while he provided the chakra. Over time, Naruto developed larger versions of the Rasengan and learned how to perform it faster.[111] During the Fourth Shinobi World War, he learned to use the Rasengan and its variants unaided with a single hand, or even form one in both hands simultaneously.[112] He also increased the size of his standard Rasengan.[113] Naruto had also shown the ability to release the Rasengan as an energy wave,[21] or as a projectile in the anime.[114] Using senjutsu or Kurama's chakra, Naruto can create more powerful and elaborate variations of the Rasengan; using the latter, he even developed the Super Mini-Tailed Beast Ball, performing it in a similar manner to the Rasengan. In the anime, usage of his tailed beast chakra also allows him to instantly perform massive Rasengan without the aid of his hands and launch in quick successions, similar to a Tailed Beast Ball.[115]

Nature Transformation
Naruto Creating Lava Rasenshuriken
Naruto simultaneously using Wind and Lava Release.

Naruto's natural affinity is Wind Release. Using shadow clones, one to form the Rasengan while another infuses the Wind chakra, Naruto could complete difficult task of producing a Rasengan that is the pinnacle of shape and nature transformation, something no one before him could accomplish, including Kakashi and his father. Once adjusting to using the Wind Release: Rasengan he could expand upon it to produce the Wind Release: Rasenshuriken. He also created different-sized variations, and could even use two Rasenshuriken simultaneously. Two years after its creation, he became skilled enough to form a Rasenshuriken without any shadow clones and throw it in his base form,[21] a feat which he previously could only do while using his enhanced modes.

After acquiring Six Paths abilities,[116] Naruto gains access to all five basic nature transformations, as well as Yang Release.[117] He could also utilize Yin–Yang Release, making perfect use of it to revitalize life-forces, heal whomever he touches, and restore missing organs.[118] After gaining chakra from the respective tailed beasts, Naruto can also use Shukaku's Magnet Release, Son Gokū's Lava Release, and Kokuō's Boil Release, able to infuse any of the other elements into is normal techniques as seamlessly as with Wind chakra. Having an arm made from Hashirama's cells, Naruto has a possibility to use Wood Release.[119]
Senjutsu
Naruto's Sage Mode
Naruto's Sage Mode.

Naruto later trained in senjutsu at Mount Myōboku, which was only possible due to his high chakra reserves. Unlike Jiraiya, he was able to perfectly balance natural energy with his chakra, and enter a complete Sage Mode, symbolised by the orange pigmentation around his yellow eyes, his toad-like pupils, and no other alterations to his appearance. Using Sage Mode made Naruto's techniques stronger, enhanced his physical parameters,[120][121][122] utilise the Frog Kata taijutsu style,[123] and sense chakra through advanced enough to identify different signatures from vast distances.[124] Since Fukasaku was unable to fuse with Naruto and gather natural energy for him due to Kurama's interference, Naruto had to employ shadow clones instead to maintain the technique, taking advantage of the clones' own buildup of natural energy being transferred to the original and let him use Sage Mode a number of times. However, creating more than five shadow clones overall would disrupt the focus of the clones gathering natural energy. The need for this method diminishes over time as Naruto became capable of entering Sage Mode much faster.[125] However, after finding unity with Kurama, Naruto overcame this problem and learned to combine Sage Mode with Kurama's chakra to further enhance his abilities, such that he could resist Nagato's control and shatter Truth-Seeking Balls. Six Paths Senjutsu
Main article: Six Paths Senjutsu
Naruto also gained access to the Six Paths Senjutsu (六道仙術, Rikudō Senjutsu), which allows him to fly and also manifest up to nine Truth-Seeking Balls, composed of all five basic natures, use Yin–Yang Release, and imbue them with the Six Paths Chakra. He can mould the balls into a myriad of shapes, fire them as projectiles and still control them from distance, or convert them into Tailed Beast Balls and use them to create Tailed Beast Ball Rasenshurikens capable of destroying the planetoids generated from Chibaku Tensei. While his shadow clones are unable to produce Truth-Seeking Balls of their own, Naruto is able to transfer control of his own to any of his shadow clones.

Six Paths Sage Mode
Main article: Six Paths Sage Mode
Naruto's SPSM
Naruto's Six Paths Sage Mode.

With the power given to him by Hagoromo Ōtsutsuki, Naruto gained access to the Six Paths Sage Mode (六道仙人モード, Rikudō Sennin Mōdo).[5] In this mode, his pupils take on a cross-like shape — without manifesting the orange pigmentation around his eyes present in Sage Mode. Going further, Naruto donned a new Nine-Tails Chakra Mode cloak, which he could access instantly and maintain much longer than his standard Sage Mode.[127] Naruto's physical attributes and techniques are further augmented,[128] to the point where he could dodge attacks that moved at the speed of light and deflect Truth-Seeking Balls. It also empowers his sensory abilities to the highest possible level,[129] which allowed him to sense the invisible shadows of Limbo.

Asura Kurama Mode
Naruto's Asura Kurama Mode.

Naruto also retained use of his Tailed Beast Mode avatar of Kurama, which rivalled Sasuke's Rinnegan-empowered Complete Body — Susanoo in size and power.[130] Using two shadow clones, he could create and combine three Kurama avatars into a single construct with three faces and six arms, which is largely reminiscent of Asura's Six Paths: Kunitsukami.[131] This state allowed Naruto to infuse two massive Rasenshuriken with natural energy whose destructive capabilities rivalled that of Sasuke's most powerful jutsu, Indra's Arrow;[132] the resulting explosion from the two techniques colliding created an enormous cyclone that was visible from outer space.[133]

Intelligence
Naruto's intelligence
Naruto reveals himself after disguising as a Wind Release: Rasenshuriken.

While headstrong and often acting without thinking, Naruto's years as a prankster had given him a cunning imagination that was useful in split-second decision making, which has repeatedly proved invaluable in battle. He is a remarkable tactile learner, able to learn better through executing a task rather than understanding the theory of it.[134][25] Jiraiya also considered him to have a good gambling instinct.[135] Once seen in action, even the likes of the Second Hokage revise their thoughts about Naruto's intellect and instinct in battle.[136] After meeting Hagoromo Ōtsutsuki, Naruto gained the innate ability to grasp the nature of chakra and comprehend all universal things,[137] allowing him to quickly master the new powers he received.

Naruto's most famous mental skill is to deceive his opponents, as he made effective use of even the most simple techniques to trick the deadliest of opponents.[140] He could formulate multi-step plans or backup plans in the thick of battle,[141] and act quickly even when given new information.[142] He can also seemingly make himself predictable by creating a pattern, only to throw off his opponent by breaking it. He has even thrown in what others would call completely useless techniques at powerful opponents to create an opening for a counterattack.[143] Naruto is rather observant, able to notice details others may overlook and subsequently take advantage of them to overcome his opponents.[144]

Naruto is protected by Iruka.

Failing once again to graduate from the Academy, a disappointed Naruto is advised by one of his instructors, Mizuki, to steal the Scroll of Seals and learn a technique from it in order to graduate. As Naruto struggled to learn the Shadow Clone Technique, Iruka Umino tracked him down and realised that Naruto was tricked by Mizuki into stealing the scroll. Mizuki attacked them and told Naruto about the Nine-Tails sealed within him, claiming that Iruka hated him because of it. When Iruka risked his life to protect Naruto, however, he saw through Mizuki's lies and used the Multiple Shadow Clone Technique to defeat him, prompting Iruka to happily grant Naruto his graduation from the Academy. Naruto would later befriend Konohamaru Sarutobi, grandson of the Third Hokage, and teach him several perverted or useful techniques.

Team Kakashi
Team 7's group photo.

Naruto was eventually assigned to Team 7, partnered with Sasuke Uchiha and Sakura Haruno under the leadership of Kakashi Hatake. During their first meeting, Naruto shared his love of ramen, his hobbies, and his dream to become Hokage. To test their qualifications, Kakashi gave the team a bell test, stating that whichever of the three takes one of the two bells on his person will officially become genin. Instead of hiding like Sakura and Sasuke, Naruto tried to take the bells from Kakashi by force, only to be easily defeated, hung upside-down from a tree and tied to a wooden post in an attempt to steal lunch. After Sakura and Sasuke fail as well, Kakashi explains that the goal of the test was to use teamwork, to do together what none of them could do by themselves. He is persuaded to allow them to try again after lunch, but instructs Sasuke and Sakura not to feed Naruto. They feed him anyway, needing him in top-form if they're to work together. Kakashi sees this and, because they care more about the team than listening to his instructions, allows them all to pass.

Zabuza Vs Genin
Naruto and Sasuke team up against Zabuza.

After a series of uneventful D-rank missions, Naruto is able to secure a C-rank mission for Team 7: escorting Tazuna to the Land of Waves. Soon after leaving Konoha, they are attacked by the Demon Brothers. Naruto is paralysed with fear, forcing Sasuke to step in to disarm them and protect Tazuna until Kakashi can capture them. Tazuna confesses that assassins have been hired to kill him but that he couldn't afford the bodyguard detail he needs. Although the mission is now A-rank in nature - far beyond the skill of genin - Team 7 decides to continue with it. Angered by Sasuke's taunting of him, Naruto cuts his hand to bleed out the poison he received earlier, vowing to never waver again. When they arrive in the Land of Waves and are confronted by Zabuza Momochi, Naruto is overwhelmed by the battle between Kakashi and Zabuza before he is knocked aside by Zabuza's water clone. Remembering his vow, Naruto regained his confidence and teamed up with Sasuke to free Kakashi from Zabuza's Water Prison. In the end, Zabuza is seemingly killed by Haku, allowing Team 7 to escort Tazuna back to his house.

Kakashi finds Zabuza's death suspicious and decides to train the team in case he returns. He has them perform the Tree Climbing Practice to improve their chakra control, which will help them against Zabuza. Naruto becomes frustrated after several failures and asks for advice from Sakura, who herself mastered it from the start. Now rapidly improving, Naruto competes with Sasuke to finish the training, each determined to outdo the other. One day, Naruto encounters Haku (albeit unaware of his true identity) and they each discussed their dreams and desire to protect those precious to them. After Haku leaves, Naruto finishes the training with Sasuke but is left exhausted, so Team 7 leaves him behind the next morning as they resume their escort duties. Naruto awakens and arrives to assist Team 7 in fighting Zabuza and Haku, but, unaware of how Haku's Demonic Mirroring Ice Crystals work, he joins Sasuke within the prison.

Naruto Holds Sasuke
Naruto's first use of the Nine-Tails' chakra.

Naruto cannot break free with his shadow clones and Sasuke cannot melt the ice with his fire. As Haku moves in to kill Naruto, Sasuke uses his body as a shield to protect Naruto and seemingly dies. Enraged by Sasuke's apparent death, Naruto unwittingly accesses the Nine-Tails' chakra for the first time, allowing him to destroy the ice mirrors and defeat Haku, breaking his mask. Realising his opponent was the boy he met before, Naruto calms himself. He is asked by Haku to kill him, since he feels of no further use to Zabuza. Before Naruto can do so, Haku immediately stops him and goes off to save Zabuza from being killed by Kakashi, sacrificing his own life. When Zabuza refuses to appreciate this, Naruto angrily scolds him, stating that Haku gave up his life to save someone precious to him. Touched by his words, Zabuza, using Naruto's kunai, killed Gatō and many of his henchmen before he himself dies. Sasuke soon awakens, and when their injuries heal, Team 7 leaves for home via Tazuna's newly-constructed Great Naruto Bridge.

Chūnin Exams

Naruto refuses to give up from the Chūnin Exams.

Team 7 resumes its series of unremarkable missions. For their performance in the Land of Waves, however, Kakashi decides to enter them in the Chūnin Exams taking place in Konoha, which greatly excites Naruto. Because they've only recently graduated from the Academy, the three feel they must give strong showings to prove themselves. When they enter the exam hall, the team is met by Rock Lee, who challenges Sasuke to a fight; Naruto tries to attack Lee in jealousy, but is easily swept aside. The fight is interrupted by Might Guy, after which Naruto notes that the bandages around Lee's arms signify his arduous taijutsu training while also mocking Sasuke for his unability to best Lee.

During the exam's first stage, the participating genin are given a written test, the goal of which is to cheat without getting caught. Unaware of this, Naruto struggles to answer the questions, so Hinata Hyūga, who is seated next to him, offers to let him copy off her paper. Despite the temptation, Naruto declined Hinata's offer, claiming that he isn't the type to cheat and that they might be disqualified if they are caught. Before the tenth question can be given, the genin are presented with the opportunity to forfeit; Naruto refuses to do so, declaring his refusal to give up and his goal to still become Hokage. His determination to face the tenth question despite the potential consequences inspires the rest of the genin to do the same, and so they pass the first stage. It is later noted that he was the only one to hand in a blank sheet, though this did not prevent him from passing.

Naruto saves Sasuke from Orochimaru
Naruto saves Sasuke from Orochimaru's snake.

For the second phase, teams enter the Forest of Death with the objective of obtaining a set of two scrolls, one of which they are given at the start. Naruto becomes separated from his team and is attacked and swallowed by a giant snake. He manages to kill it and regroups with his frightened teammates against Orochimaru. Angered by Sasuke's sudden cowardice and resignation, Naruto engages Orochimaru using the Nine-Tails' chakra, defeats his giant snake, and taunts Sasuke before Orochimaru suppresses the Nine-Tails' chakra, rendering Naruto unconscious. After he awakens, Team 7 continues its search for the second scroll, which they eventually gain by defeating Team Oboro, allowing them to pass the second stage.

Uzumakirendan
Naruto defeats Kiba.

In the preliminary matches of the exam, Naruto was pitted against Kiba Inuzuka and his dog, Akamaru. Believing the match to be an easy victory, Kiba and Akamaru overwhelmed Naruto with many high-speed attacks, so Naruto tricks Kiba into knocking Akamaru out of the fight by using the Transformation Technique, shocking all spectators. Naruto then disorients Kiba by farting in his face and defeats him with the Naruto Uzumaki Combo (which he invented from watching Sasuke's Lion Combo). When Neji and Hinata's match begins, Naruto is enraged by Neji's ruthless tirade against Hinata and cheers Hinata on to defeat Neji. Although Hinata is defeated, Naruto wipes up her blood and vows to defeat Neji in the finals.

Naruto meets Kurama
Naruto meets the Nine-Tails.

During the month of training, Naruto first meets Jiraiya (who knocked out Ebisu, Naruto's original teacher) and trains under the Sannin to improve his chakra control. Recognising Naruto as the Nine-Tails' jinchūriki, Jiraiya removes the seal Orochimaru had placed on Naruto to ease his control and begins teaching him how to use the Nine-Tails' power by summoning toads. To accelerate Naruto's slow progress, Jiraiya pushes him over a cliff, causing Naruto to enter his subconscious and meet the Nine-Tails. Working past his fear, he bravely demands chakra from it as "rent" for living in his body. The Nine-Tails complies and Naruto summons Gamabunta, though he exhausts himself and ends up in the hospital, where he is visited by Shikamaru Nara. After talking, he and Naruto stop Gaara from killing Rock Lee in the next room and listen to Gaara's story of his childhood, which Naruto finds very similar to his own. Gaara prepares to kill them, but Might Guy intervenes and forces Gaara to retreat. On the day of the finals, Naruto meets Hinata at the Third Training Ground and expresses his doubts about his upcoming match with Neji. Hinata reassures Naruto that he never gave up because he always had the strength to overcome his own failures, admiring him for it. Reinvigorated, Naruto thanks Hinata and tells her even though he first thought she was weird, he now likes her.

Naruto vs Neji
Naruto vs. Neji.

Facing Neji in the first match of the finals, Naruto began by creating shadow clones to overwhelm Neji's with sheer numbers. Deeming Naruto a failure who could never defeat a genius like himself, Neji easily defeats Naruto's clones and seals his chakra with Eight Trigrams Sixty-Four Palms. Determined to prove Neji's ideals about fate wrong, Naruto tapped into the Nine-Tails' chakra and, revitalised, clashed with Neji. When the smoke cleared, Neji emerges and Naruto lies defeated. This, however, was only a shadow clone, and the real Naruto burst from the ground beneath Neji, defeating him with an uppercut. Before he is declared the winner, Naruto tells Neji that creating clones was once his shortcoming and that Neji needs to stop believing in inescapable fate. When Sasuke finally arrives for his match with Gaara, Naruto is envious of Sasuke's improvements, but is later put to sleep along with most of the audience, commencing the Konoha Crush.

Naruto saves Sasuke from Gaara.

Sakura wakes up Naruto so they can pursue Sasuke, who was pursuing Gaara himself. They arrive in time for Naruto to kick Gaara away before he can kill Sasuke. Partially transformed into Shukaku, Gaara knocks Sakura unconscious and binds her to a tree, forcing Naruto to battle him, with little success. Naruto relates to Gaara's painful life as a jinchūriki, but he is not willing to let anything to happen to Sakura and Sasuke. Determined to protect his friends, Naruto creates an army of shadow clones to relentlessly batter Gaara, forcing him to fully transform into Shukaku, to which Naruto responds by summoning Gamabunta.

Gaara puts himself to sleep to give control of his body to Shukaku, forcing Naruto and Gamabunta to figure out a way to end the jutsu. They do so by transforming into a giant fox (the Nine-Tails in the anime) to restrain Shukaku, allowing Naruto to awaken Gaara with a solid punch to the face. Shukaku's influence disappears, but Gaara regains control and traps Naruto with his sand. Naruto escapes by tapping into the Nine-Tails' chakra, and headbutts Gaara when he is close enough, destroying Shukaku's form. Exhausted from the fight, the two leap at each other for one final exchange, and Naruto punches Gaara, claiming victory.

Naruto and Gaara fell to the ground, unable to move. Slowly crawling towards Gaara, Naruto explained that he also suffered a painful and lonely life, but was later saved by having friends. To that end, he will do anything to protect them, even if it means killing Gaara. Understanding Naruto's true strength, Gaara retreated with Kankurō and Temari with a new outlook on life, while Naruto passes out from exhaustion and is returned to Konoha with Sasuke and a rescued Sakura. A few days later, Team 7 attended the Third Hokage's funeral.

Search for Tsunade
Main article: Search for Tsunade
Jiraiya is tasked with finding Tsunade, a candidate for Fifth Hokage, and convinces Naruto to accompany him by promising to teach him a technique stronger than Sasuke's Chidori. Stopping at an inn in Shukuba Town, Naruto was approached by Kisame Hoshigaki and Itachi Uchiha of Akatsuki, who intend to capture the Nine-Tails. When Sasuke shows up and furiously attacks Itachi, Naruto gathers the Nine-Tails' chakra to help Sasuke, but it is absorbed by Kisame's Samehada. Jiraiya soon arrives and drives off Itachi and Kisame, but Sasuke is left mentally and physically damaged by Itachi. Might Guy appears and takes Sasuke back to Konoha, but not before giving Naruto a spare green jumpsuit.

Tsunade vs naruto
Naruto and Tsunade face-off.

To prepare for the next encounter with Akatsuki, Naruto begins learning the Rasengan, completing two of its three learning steps. Taking a break from training, Naruto and Jiraiya eventually found Tsunade and her assistant Shizune at a restaurant. When Tsunade refuses the offer to become Hokage and insults all who held the title, an angry Naruto challenged her to a fight and attacked her with an incomplete Rasengan, only to be easily defeated. Impressed by his progress, however, Tsunade makes a bet with Naruto: if he can master the Rasengan in a week, he gets the First Hokage's Necklace; if not, she gets his wallet. Naruto agreed and spent the week trying to perfect the Rasengan, but has no success and collapses from exhaustion. Once he recovers, Naruto heads out with Jiraiya and Shizune to stop Tsunade from meeting with Orochimaru.

Naruto defeats Kabuto.

They arrive to see Tsunade, who never intended to aid Orochimaru, in the midst of battle with Kabuto Yakushi. When Tsunade is incapacitated, Naruto fights Kabuto in her place and eventually defeats him with a perfected Rasengan, which he formed by using a shadow clone. Naruto collapses almost immediately afterwards, his heart muscles torn by Kabuto, but Tsunade successfully manages to heal him, gives him the necklace he wins, and accepts the position of Hokage. After Orochimaru and Kabuto are defeated, Naruto and the others return to Konoha, Tsunade confidently believing Naruto would someday become a great Hokage.

Naruto's Promise
Naruto promises Sakura to return Sasuke to Konoha.

Naruto visits a recovering Sasuke at the hospital, but is immediately challenged to a fight, to which Naruto eventually agrees. The fight escalates quickly, culminating with Naruto using Rasengan and Sasuke using Chidori. Kakashi arrives and deflects their attacks into opposing water towers before they can clash, Naruto unknowingly doing more damage than Sasuke. Distressed by Sasuke's behaviour, Sakura informs Naruto of the cursed seal Sasuke received from Orochimaru, though Naruto assures Sakura that Sasuke would never abandon Konoha for power. Unfortunately, Sasuke does just that and Naruto joins the Sasuke Recovery Team in order to bring him back; he promises a tearful Sakura to do so before he leaves. En route to Sasuke, the team encounters members of the Sound Four, each of which battles a member of the recovery team, while Naruto engages Kimimaro. Overwhelmed by Kimimaro's taijutsu skills, Naruto is saved at the last minute by Rock Lee, who volunteers to fight Kimimaro while Naruto heads after Sasuke.

Naruto Sasuke clash
Naruto fights Sasuke.

Naruto finally meets Sasuke at the Valley of the End. His pleas for Sasuke to come back to Konoha and warns him that Orochimaru will take his body, but his pleadings fall on deaf ears. Naruto starts attacking him, ready to take him back to Konoha by force if necessary. Undeterred, Sasuke responds by tapping into his cursed seal and landing a series of heavy blows on Naruto. It becomes painfully clear to Naruto that Sasuke is fighting with an intent to kill, so Naruto utilises the Nine-Tails' chakra to overpower Sasuke. Naruto says that Sasuke is like a brother to him and that he will do anything to protect that bond. Sasuke vows to sever that bond, but acknowledges Naruto as an equal by putting on his forehead protector. They continue trading blows, with Naruto eventually manifesting a fox-shaped cloak and Sasuke entering his cursed seal's second level. Naruto clashes his Rasengan with Sasuke's Chidori, and within the dome of resulting energy they trade final blows: Sasuke punches Naruto and Naruto scratches Sasuke's forehead protector.

When the energy dissipates, Naruto lies defeated, but Sasuke spares him and continues his way to Orochimaru, leaving his scratched forehead protector behind. Kakashi and Pakkun arrive late and failing to retrieve Sasuke, leave with Naruto. In the hospital, Naruto once again promises Sakura to bring Sasuke back one day. Soon after, Jiraiya arrived with an offer to train Naruto for preparation against Orochimaru and Akatsuki in three years and to give up on Sasuke, as he is no different from Orochimaru. Naruto accepts Jiraiya's training, but refuses to give up on Sasuke, satisfying Jiraiya.

As in the manga, Naruto later departs with Jiraiya to begin his two and a half years of training, after making a determined gesture at the Fourth Hokage's statue. In the anime, this does not happen until about 3 months later as Jiraiya was occupied with important intel gathering about Akatsuki for Konohagakure. During the waiting period, Tsunade gives Naruto several missions with members of the Konoha 11 to keep him busy.

Naruto Improving Resengan
Naruto training with the Big Ball Rasengan.

In the anime, shortly after leaving Konoha, Jiraiya and Naruto discuss the fact that Naruto will need to learn how to counter genjutsu if he hopes to be a match against Sasuke the next time they meet. Naruto practises with Gamariki to dispel genjutsu, but he struggles with it and his chakra keeps hitting Gamariki, who doesn't appreciate it. Naruto follows Jiraiya to the Genjutsu Tree Village to try a different approach, but they discover the village has been taken over by Kandachi.[145] They free the villagers and then attack Kandachi, who Naruto eventually defeats with his newly-created Big Ball Rasengan. As they leave afterwards, Jiraiya is pleased by how similar Naruto is to Minato Namikaze and hugs him, which Naruto is bothered by.[146]

Two years into their training, Naruto's control of the Nine-Tails' chakra has improved significantly. Jiraiya tries to give him more access to the Nine-Tails' power and uses Gerotora to weaken Naruto's Eight Trigrams Sealing Style. Seizing the opportunity, the Nine-Tails mocked Naruto for his inability to save Sasuke, using Naruto's negative emotions to force him to enter a version 2 form with four tails. Not in control of his body, Naruto attacks Jiraiya and nearly kills him before he manages to suppress the Nine-Tails. Naruto has no memory of what happened and Jiraiya doesn't tell him, instead, shifting Naruto's training to other pursuits, including keeping his anger in check so that the Nine-Tails won't flare up again.[147]

Naruto returns to Konoha
Naruto returns to Konohagakure.

Naruto and Jiraiya return to Konoha after two-and-a-half years of training, where Naruto becomes surprised by Tsunade's newly-formed statue on Hokage Rock. He greets his old friends afterwards: he gives Kakashi a copy of Icha Icha Tactics as a gift; he catches up with Sakura, whom he has become taller than; he gets back into a competition of Sexy Techniques with Konohamaru Sarutobi, only to be violently reprimanded by Sakura. Kakashi reforms Team 7 with them and gives them another bell test, but unlike last time, taking the bells from him is the real objective. As with last time, Naruto launches a first attack before the test officially begins, but this time it nearly succeeds. Despite their improved abilities, Naruto and Sakura were still unable to get a bell through conventional means, and it was only by Naruto's threat to spoil the latest Icha Icha novel that they distracted Kakashi long enough to take the bells.

While Team 7 tries without success to find a mission to go on that Naruto won't complain about, word reaches Konoha that Akatsuki has kidnapped Gaara, the Kazekage. Team 7 is sent to Sunagakure to assist in rescuing Gaara. On their way to Suna, Naruto explains that Gaara was kidnapped because he is the jinchūriki of the One-Tail, just as Naruto is the jinchūriki of the Nine-Tails. Upon arrival in Suna, Naruto defends Kakashi from Chiyo's assault when she mistakes him for his father. Team 7 gathers what intel they can on Gaara's kidnappers and leave to go after them; Chiyo volunteers to escort them since they aren't familiar with the country around Suna. Naruto promises a recovering Kankurō to rescue Gaara before they leave.

Naruto pummels Deidara
Naruto pummels Deidara.

While en route to an Akatsuki lair, they are confronted by Itachi Uchiha, who traps Naruto in a genjutsu. Sakura and Chiyo release him, allowing Naruto to team up with Kakashi and defeat Itachi with a Big Ball Rasengan. The Itachi is discovered to be an impostor, so they continue to the Akatsuki lair, meeting up with Team Guy, who takes down the barrier over the entrance so that Team 7 can get in. They find Gaara's body finds with his kidnappers, Deidara and Sasori. Deidara flies off with Gaara's body with Naruto and Kakashi in pursuit, leaving Sasori to Chiyo and Sakura. Naruto, enraged, makes repeated failed attempts to rescue Gaara before he is calmed by Kakashi, who uses his new Mangekyō Sharingan to distract Deidara with Kamui. Naruto retrieves Gaara's body, but seeing it drives him over the edge: he furiously attacks Deidara and beats him mercilessly into the ground. Discovering that it was a Clay Clone, Naruto slips into his two-tailed form in rage, but is restored to normal by Kakashi via the Chakra-Suppressing Seal.

Gaara awakens
Gaara awakens, with Naruto by his side.

Deidara escapes, while Naruto and Kakashi regroup with Sakura, Chiyo, and Team Guy. Sakura attempts to revive Gaara, but the removal of Shukaku has caused him to die. Naruto breaks down in tears and angrily lashes out at Chiyo, saying she had no right to make Gaara not only a jinchūriki, but also lose his life because of it. As atonement and with Naruto's aid, Chiyo sacrifices her life to revive Gaara; as the jutsu nears completion, Chiyo voices her faith in Naruto's ability to save Gaara and to become Hokage. Naruto greets Gaara when he awakens, and a few days later, Teams 7 and Guy attend Chiyo's funeral in Suna. Before returning home, Naruto and Gaara shake hands (Gaara using his sand) as a sign of their close relationship.

Naruto and Sai's first meeting
Naruto and Sai's first encounter.

During her fight with Sasori, Sakura learned of an opportunity to meet with a spy in Orochimaru's ranks in a few days' time, hoping it will lead them to Sasuke. Kakashi is left bedridden from his fight with Deidara, so Yamato leads Team 7 as his replacement. Replacing Sasuke on the team is Sai, whom Naruto actually encounters earlier and dislikes, declaring him an inferior version of Sasuke. Sai is happy for this distinction and proceeds to degrade Sasuke for defecting from Konoha, forcing Yamato to use his Wood Release to break up their fight. Naruto is constantly exasperated by Sai's lack of empathy and his ridicule of Sasuke, but resolves to work with Sai if it means saving Sasuke.

Team Yamato at Tenchi Bridge
Team 7 confronts Orochimaru and Kabuto.

Yamato disguises himself as Sasori and goes to the Tenchi Bridge to meet the spy while Naruto, Sakura, and Sai hide nearby. The spy, Kabuto Yakushi, begins telling Yamato about Orochimaru's organisation, but they are interrupted by the arrival of Orochimaru, who teams up with Kabuto to fight Yamato, having intended to kill Sasori. Team 7 comes to his aid and Orochimaru, recognising them, taunts Naruto about Sasuke. Naruto is enraged and strikes him, using his version 1 form to make his attacks more devastating. Naruto's rage intensifies as he submits to the Nine-Tails' influence: he destroys the Tenchi Bridge and eventually advances to his version 2 form while fighting Orochimaru. Naruto is soon forced back to the destroyed bridge, where, unable to tell friend from foe, he unknowingly attacks Sakura when she approaches him.

Naruto vs
A four-tailed Naruto attacks Orochimaru with Tailed Beast Ball.

Yamato restrains Naruto with his Wood Release and suppresses the Nine-Tails' influence, but its chakra leaves Naruto's body badly damaged. After Sakura heals him, Naruto wakes up unable to remember what happened, but is surprised by the devastated landscape. When they realise that Sai is missing, Yamato reports that he has joined with Orochimaru and Kabuto. On the way, Yamato secretly takes Naruto aside and tells him that he is the one who attacked Sakura. He encourages Naruto to use his own strength instead of the Nine-Tails in order to protect his loved ones. The team locates Sai, whom Yamato has placed a trace on, at Orochimaru's lair and capture him. Restrained, Sai asks why Naruto is determined to save him; Naruto replies that his bond with Sasuke is too precious to be broken and that he will do anything to protect it. Intrigued, Sai switches sides, helping them capture Kabuto and then searching the base for Sasuke on Naruto's behalf. While he's gone, Yamato goes through his belongings and finds evidence that Sai has been assigned to assassinate Sasuke.

Sasuke draws sword
Naruto encounters Sasuke.

When they find Sai, he explains that he truly does want to help retrieve Sasuke, and in fact has already found him: Naruto and Sakura are speechless to see Sasuke again. Sasuke reacts with indifference to them, but Naruto remarks he can't become Hokage without saving his friend. To demonstrate that they mean nothing to him, Sasuke quickly neutralises them all. As Naruto struggles to avoid the temptation of using the Nine-Tails, Sasuke suddenly appears in Naruto's subconscious using his Sharingan and suppresses the Nine-Tails. He then prepares to kill them, but is persuaded not to by Orochimaru and leaves without further comment. Naruto is upset at having failed once more to bring Sasuke home, but is reminded by Sakura that they need to become stronger and Team 7 returns to Konoha.

Naruto training
Naruto training with his clones.

Once Kakashi is done recuperating in the hospital, he assembles Naruto, Sakura, and Sai to discuss their failed mission to retrieve Sasuke. Kakashi believes the best way to match Sasuke is for Naruto to create a new jutsu. As the training began, Naruto discovers that his nature is wind and learns to use the wind nature. Ordinarily, such training would take months or years, but Kakashi advises that Naruto, by training alongside hundreds of shadow clones can do the same training in a mere fraction of the time. With Kakashi's instructions and the training grounds created by Yamato, Naruto quickly masters how to use the wind nature. The next step is more difficult for him: combining that nature with the Rasengan.

Naruto vs Kakuzu 
Naruto defeats Kakuzu.

Like Kakashi and Minato Namikaze before him, Naruto fails several times in trying to combine his nature with the Rasengan; his frustration evokes the Nine-Tails' chakra at times, which Yamato suppresses. With further advice from Kakashi, Naruto finds his solution using two shadow clones: one helps him form the Rasengan and the other adds his wind nature. When they receive news that Asuma died in battle with members of Akatsuki, they take a break to attend Asuma's funeral. Kakashi leaves Yamato in charge of overseeing Naruto's training so he could help Team 10 avenge Asuma. Having finished his jutsu, Naruto and Team Yamato went to provide assistance, arriving in time to save Kakashi and Team 10 from Kakuzu. Naruto engages Kakuzu alone with his newly-created Wind Release: Rasenshuriken, though it dissipates on its first use and Naruto is rescued by Kakashi and Yamato. The technique succeeds the second time, destroying two of Kakuzu's hearts and putting the last one on the brink of failure. Kakashi finishes off Kakuzu and they return to Konoha.

The Rasenshuriken injures Naruto's arm after use and he is forbidden to use the technique ever again. When they visit Ichiraku Ramen, Naruto has a hard time eating while his arm mends, so Sakura opts to help, before the responsibility falls to Sai, then to Kakashi. As they leave afterwards, they are met by Konohamaru, who demonstrates his Sexy: Girl on Girl Technique; Naruto approves but Sakura is disgusted and violently reprimands him. In the manga, Konohamaru responds with Sexy: Boy on Boy Technique; Sakura approves but Naruto is disgusted and violently reprimands him.

When they split up to search, Naruto, because he's a target of Akatsuki, is given a protective escort in the form of Hinata, Yamato, and Bull. Their group encounters Kabuto, who offers them intel on Akatsuki and its members, his thanks to Naruto "inspiring" him to overcome Orochimaru after absorbing his remains. Kabuto then escapes.

After regrouping and Kiba Inuzuka detects Sasuke's trail, Naruto creates shadow clones to search the area faster, one of which encounters Itachi. Itachi repels Naruto's attacks and insists he only wants to talk. He asks Naruto what Sasuke means to him and what he will do if Sasuke ever moves against Konoha. Naruto replies that he is Sasuke's brother – a better brother than Itachi is – and that if Sasuke ever attacks the village he will defend it without killing Sasuke. Itachi is happy with this answer and gives Naruto some assistance for this purpose: a special crow that he stores within Naruto's body. Itachi left, and Naruto continued his search, eventually finding Sasuke.[148]

As they near Sasuke's location they are intercepted by Tobi of Akatsuki, who prevents them from progressing and who is invulnerable to their attacks.

Naruto after Jiraiya's death
Naruto mourns Jiraiya's death.

As Naruto contemplated his meeting with Itachi, he was called to the Hokage Residence to hear sombre news: his master Jiraiya was killed by Pain, the leader of Akatsuki. Grief-stricken, Naruto blamed Tsunade and spent the day mourning his teacher's death, depressed that Jiraiya cannot see him become Hokage. After being comforted by Iruka and Shikamaru, Naruto helped to decipher Jiraiya's dying message and eventually they succeed. Understanding that Jiraiya had bought him time for his own fight with Pain, Naruto went to train with the toads of Mount Myōboku to learn senjutsu. Naruto trained to harmonise with nature, a process he sped up by using a limited number of shadow clones. He rapidly progressed through the training stages and attained a perfect Sage Mode, which Jiraiya was unable to do. News of Pain's Assault on Konoha reached them, they began to mobilise for battle.

Naruto and Fukasaku
Naruto arrives to fight Pain.

As Naruto, Fukasaku, Gamaken, Gamahiro, Gamabunta, and Gamakichi were summoned to the centre of Konoha, the group was confronted by the Six Paths of Pain, who had just destroyed the village. After destroying the Asura Path before it could attack Tsunade, Naruto told her to make sure everyone left the battle to him. After a brief skirmish with Animal Path, Naruto and the toads defeated the Animal, Preta, and Human Paths before running out of senjutsu chakra. Naruto revealed that he had two shadow clones waiting back at Mount Myōboku to revitalise him with natural energy. Naruto went back on the offensive, dispatching the healed Preta and Naraka Path before the Deva Path regained its full power. Pain killed Fukasaku and used the opportunity to capture Naruto, pinning him down to the ground.

Naruto influenced
Naruto succumbs completely to the Nine-Tails' influence.

With Naruto restrained, Pain opened up his reasons for Akatsuki, their plan for the tailed beasts, and the peaceful world he wanted to create. Though Naruto rejected his notion that using a weapon to force peace, he could offer no alternative. Before Pain could depart with Naruto, he was attacked by Hinata Hyūga. Declaring her love for Naruto and vowing to protect him, she continued to fight against Pain before she was subdued and critically wounded. Believing Hinata to had been killed, an enraged Naruto erupted into his six-tailed form. Resisting the First Hokage's Necklace's attempted to quell the transformation and destroying it, the Nine-Tails attacked Pain, forcing him out of the village to get close enough to his actual body to use the Chibaku Tensei, trapping Naruto within the small satellite. The technique was not enough to stop the Nine-Tails, however, as it simply progressed to eight-tailed form to force its way out of the satellite. Meanwhile within his subconscious, Naruto was tempted by the Nine-Tails to open its seal to save him from the pain of not having Pain's answer for peace. However, before Naruto could, Minato appeared, having left some of his chakra within the seal in case of an emergency to protect his son. Overjoyed at meeting his father, but angered that he would condemn him to life as a jinchūriki, Naruto listened to his father encouraging him, confident that he would find a way to break the cycle of hatred. After repairing the seal, Minato disappeared and the newly-inspired Naruto prepared to resume his battle with Pain.

Naruto defeating Deva path
Naruto defeats Pain.

Confidence restored, Naruto was greatly relieved to learn that not only had Hinata survived, but nobody was injured during his rampage. After clever use of shadow clones, Naruto destroyed the Deva Path with a Rasengan, defeating the last of Pain's Six Paths. Using one of Pain's Black Receivers, Naruto followed the chakra signal to Nagato and Konan's position. Confronting Nagato, Naruto listened to Nagato's story that turned him into Pain and came to understand why he made the actions he did. Despite not forgiving him, he told Nagato he would not kill him and would instead try to create the better world that their teacher wished for. Moved by Naruto's determination to create a better world, Nagato decided to put his trust in Naruto and sacrificed his own life to revive all the people he had killed in Konoha. Naruto helped Konan retrieve Nagato and Yahiko's bodies for burial in Amegakure, and Konan left Naruto a bouquet of paper flowers for him, symbolising their new alliance.

Hero of the Hidden Leaf
The village greets Naruto upon his return.

Naruto then created a memorial for Jiraiya and left the flowers and a copy of The Tale of the Utterly Gutsy Shinobi by a rock with the kanji for teacher (師, shi). While the exhausted Naruto walked back to the village, he was found by Kakashi who carried him the rest of the way. Upon arrival, Naruto was greeted as a hero by the villagers, his dream of acknowledgement being realised at last.

Karui Beating Naruto
Naruto willingly gets beaten by Karui.

Sakura informs Naruto that Tsunade fell into a coma and that there's nothing that can be done to bring her out of it. While they talk, they are approached by Tazuna and Inari, who have come to help rebuild Konoha. They ask about Sasuke, which Naruto avoids going into detail about so as to spare them and Sakura a discussion about Sasuke's defection. After Tazuna and Inari leave, they receive news that Danzō Shimura has become the next Hokage and that he has ordered Sasuke be killed as a traitor. Naruto and Sakura approach Sai to ask him how they can convince Danzō to change his mind, but Sai is unable to help. Omoi and Karui of Kumogakure overhear them talking about Sasuke and they ask for information about Sasuke, wishing to kill him for his role in Akatsuki's capture of Killer B. Naruto leads Omoi and Karui away to spare Sakura pain, but refuses to reveal anything about Sasuke. Instead, Naruto allows the Kumo-nin vent their anger by beating him, to which Karui obliges until Sai stops her and the Kumo-nin retreat.

Naruto's failed plea to Raikage
Naruto unsuccessfully pleas the Raikage to forgive Sasuke.

Recovering later, Naruto asked Yamato and Kakashi to take him to the Land of Iron, so that he could ask Fourth Raikage to pardon Sasuke. Upon arrival, the Raikage rejected Naruto's request even with Kakashi and Yamato's assistance and berated him for defending a criminal. Naruto went to a local inn to ponder his next course of action, but was soon confronted by Tobi, who wanted to understand Nagato's change of heart. Naruto ignored the question and demanded to know about his plans with Sasuke. Tobi told him about the Sage of the Six Paths, the Uchiha clan, and the truth about the Uchiha Clan Downfall, all of which now drove Sasuke along a path of vengeance against Konoha and anyone else who would dare cross his path. Naruto insisted that he could still get through to Sasuke, but Tobi laughed and left, saying that Naruto and Sasuke were fated to fight again.

As one's friend
Naruto talks with Gaara about Sasuke.

While Naruto was practising his Sage Mode's sensory abilities to locate Sasuke, he was interrupted by the arrival of Sakura, Rock Lee, Kiba and Sai. Sakura attempted to dissuade Naruto in his attempts to bring Sasuke back to Konoha by falsely telling him that she loved him. However, Naruto knew she was lying and he rejected her confession and her proposal to abandon Sasuke, stating it had nothing to do with his promise to her. After Sakura's party left, Sai's ink clone revealed that the rest of the Konoha 11 had decided to kill Sasuke themselves to prevent another war, while Sakura planned to kill Sasuke herself, at Sai's unintended insistence. Gaara, who attended the Five Kage Summit that Sasuke attacked, arrived and revealed Tobi's declaration of the Fourth Shinobi World War, telling Naruto how they would be fighting Sasuke to protect Naruto, but he did advise Naruto to consider for himself what was the right thing to do. After hearing that most of his friends have turned against Sasuke, who now wanted to unleash his vengeance on just about everyone, Naruto hyperventilated and passed out. When he awoke, he was told by Yamato that Kakashi went to stop Sakura from dealing with Sasuke.

Using a shadow clone as a decoy, Naruto escaped from the inn and followed Kakashi, arriving just in time to save Sakura from being killed by Sasuke. He tried once more to reason with Sasuke, sympathising with his pain and acknowledging Itachi's sacrifice. However, Sasuke was unmoved and declared his resolve to destroy Konoha and sever the Uchiha's connection to the shinobi world. Naruto then clashed his Rasengan with Sasuke's Chidori, realising that everything in his life he could have easily gone down the same path of Sasuke. Despite his jealousy of him, he had come to like Sasuke and was glad to have met him. Undeterred, Sasuke gave Naruto two options: kill or be killed; Naruto chose neither. Tobi and Zetsu arrived and prepared to depart with Sasuke. Naruto resolved that if he and Sasuke were to battle again, they would kill each other, but he was willing to accept it as he would shoulder Sasuke's hatred alone. Sasuke vowed to kill Naruto first and left with Tobi and Zetsu, while Naruto and his teammates returned to Konoha, with the captive Karin. Naruto explained the situation to his friends and asked to fight Sasuke alone, determined to get stronger for their upcoming battle.

The Great Toad's Prediction
Naruto meets with the Great Toad Sage.

As Naruto was about to eat at Ichiraku, he was suddenly summoned back to Mount Myōboku by Fukasaku. He learns from the Great Toad Sage's fortune that he would meet an "octopus" and would battle a "young man with powerful eyes." When Gerotora was summoned to give Naruto the "key" to the Eight Trigrams Seal, Naruto knew he would need the Nine-Tails' power for the battles to come and accepted the key. Naruto was sent back to Ichiraku, where some of the villagers asked for his autograph. Naruto was unaware that the five Kage were planning to keep him from participating in the upcoming Fourth Shinobi World War. For his safety, Tsunade gave Naruto an "S-rank mission" on a remote island in the Land of Lightning with Yamato, Might Guy, Aoba Yamashiro, and other Konoha-nin as security.

Once at the island, Naruto met Killer B, the jinchūriki of Eight-Tails, and requested to train under him after marvelling at B's mastery of his tailed beast. B refused as he was on vacation, despite Naruto's best efforts to impress him. However, when Motoi heard Naruto bumped fists with B, he took Naruto was taken to Falls of Truth, where B trained to control the Eight-Tails. Following Motoi's instructions, Naruto sat on the platform in front of the waterfall and closed his eyes to see his true self: Dark Naruto, who berated Naruto on how quickly the Konoha villagers changed their opinions of him and exclaimed that the Nine-Tails liked him better. Inside his mind, Naruto fought his dark self, but found that they were evenly matched. Breaking out of meditation, Naruto questioned Motoi about B's history in order to learn how to conquer his inner darkness.

Cho-odama
Naruto fights the Nine-Tails.

Naruto reminisced about how B and Gaara changed everyone's opinions about them and began to doubt if the Konoha villagers sincerely trusted him. After witnessing B save Motoi from a giant squid and resume their friendship, an inspired Naruto returned to the Falls of Truth and confronted Dark Naruto again. With Naruto now having faith in himself, Dark Naruto began to weaken as he asked what his reason for existing was. Naruto answered by hugging him, accepted Dark Naruto as a part of him while thanking him for pushing him to become a better person. Dark Naruto finally relented and faded. B led Naruto and Yamato to a special room in the secret temple behind the waterfall, where Naruto was prepared to fight the Nine-Tails for its chakra. Within his subconscious, Naruto unlocked the seal and engaged the Nine-Tails in battle using Sage Mode. Though he appeared to have the upper hand and drain the Nine-Tails' chakra, the fox instantly planted its own hatred within its absorbed chakra, consuming Naruto.

Naruto and Kushina meet
Naruto meets his mother.

Just before Naruto was completely consumed, the spirit of his mother, Kushina Uzumaki, appeared. Naruto believed that Kushina was the Nine-Tails in disguise, earning a hit on the head and an immediate apology from her, who hoped that he did not inherit her short-temper. Realising Kushina was his mother, he tearfully hugged her and the love-filled reunion purged the Nine-Tails' hatred within its drained chakra. With renewed confidence from hearing the story of his parents, Naruto battled the Nine-Tails once more. With his mother's assistance, Naruto successfully weakens the fox long enough to separate it from its chakra. Attaining the Nine-Tails Chakra Mode, Naruto imprisons the emaciated and infuriated Nine-Tails within a new, stronger seal, apologising to it as it faded into darkness. Afterwards, Naruto learned from Kushina about his heritage, the truth behind the Nine-Tails' attack on Konoha, and how his parents gave their lives to protect him. Naruto told his mother that he could finally understand what a parent's love felt like and that he didn't blame them for what happened, instead feeling glad to be their son. As she fades away, Kushina tearfully hugged Naruto, thanking him for letting her and Minato be his parents.

Naruto crashes into Kisame
Naruto attacks Kisame.

In the real world, Naruto demonstrated his Nine-Tails Chakra Mode to B and Yamato before sensing Kisame Hoshigaki of Akatsuki hidden inside his Samehada via his negative emotions. When Kisame attempted to escape, Naruto used his blinding speed to quickly smash Kisame into the wall, though his foot gets stuck. Yamato helps Naruto out while B pursues Kisame and they regroup to see Kisame's defeat by Guy. Kisame is restrained for interrogation, though he breaks free of his confinements through sheer will and summons sharks inside a water prison to eat him alive. Shocked by Kisame's suicide, Naruto observes that even those in Akatsuki fight for their comrades. They examine the intel that Kisame was trying to send, which turns out to be booby-trapped: they are each caught in a water prison and are trapped alongside a shark. Another shark, meanwhile, is able to escape with Kisame's intel. After they escape, Naruto is tasked with evacuating the giant animals into the Island Turtle's shell and logging the island's ecology as part of his "official" S-rank mission. He remains unaware that it is a ploy to keep him away from the war.

Naruto senses the war
Naruto senses the war with Sage Mode.

Naruto returned to the Falls of Truth with B to start practising his Nine-Tails Chakra Mode, specifically learning how to use Tailed Beast Balls. Since Tailed Beast Balls couldn't be made without the Nine-Tails' cooperation, Naruto tried to create the Tailed Beast Rasengan as a workaround. While struggling to balance the jutsu's composition, he sensed a distant source of the Nine-Tails' chakra. Naruto left the Falls of Truth to investigate and was met by a contingent of Konoha-nin, amongst them Iruka Umino. Iruka tried to convince him to go back to his training, but Naruto bypassed them and, from entering Sage Mode, sensed the ongoing Fourth Shinobi World War. Naruto became angry that they would try to keep the war a secret from him and that they wouldn't let him help. Iruka apologised, yet still made an effort to restrain him. Naruto escaped and found a Self-Repairing Barrier, preventing him from leaving by himself. B, at Iruka's request, decided to join him, and together they broke through the barrier.

Naruto in Kyubi's eye
Naruto states his resolve to the Nine-Tails.

Shortly after, the Nine-Tails pulled Naruto into his subconscious, berating him for squandering its chakra and calling him naive for thinking he could stop the war by himself. When the Nine-Tails failed to once again tempt Naruto with power, the fox went off to claim that his attempt to put an end to hatred was futile, using his history with Sasuke as proof. Naruto responded by pinning the fox down, refuting that it was the one who was being naive and confidently exclaiming he would find a way to deal with Sasuke and end the war. Before he leaves, Naruto also promises to resolve the Nine-Tails' own hatred someday, unnerving the fox.

Naruto bypasses A
Naruto outpaces A.

On their way to the battlefield, Naruto and B were met by the Fourth Raikage and Tsunade, both intent on stopping the jinchūriki. B tried to convince the Raikage to let them go, and when that failed, Naruto tried to get around them, but the Raikage's Lightning Release Chakra Mode was too fast for that. The Raikage became increasingly aggressive in his determination to stop Naruto and B from joining the war effort, going so far as to threaten to kill Naruto if it would keep Akatsuki from capturing the Nine-Tails. First B and then Tsunade joined Naruto in arguing to allow them to fight, which the Raikage relented to once Naruto dodges his maximum speed. On Tsunade's orders, Shikaku Nara contacted Naruto and informed him about Akatsuki's White Zetsu Army and the accompanying Impure World Reincarnations. Naruto and B soon afterwards encountered a squad of seeming Allied forces, but with his Nine-Tails Chakra Mode's ability, it allowed him to detect them as disguised Zetsu. He quickly defeated them and sent shadow clones to various other battlefields to lend assistance.

Naruto kills dog
Naruto fights Nagato.

Naruto and B soon ran into the reincarnated Itachi Uchiha and Nagato. They greeted Naruto and briefly caught up on what had happened since their deaths, but were quickly forced to attack by their summoner, Kabuto Yakushi. Nagato advised Naruto and B on how to counter his jutsu while Itachi, between his own attacks, recalled the crow he planted in Naruto during their last meeting. Itachi activated the Kotoamatsukami of the crow's Mangekyō Sharingan to release himself from Kabuto's influence. Itachi joined Naruto and B in fighting Nagato, first by neutralising the Rinnegan Summoning and then saving them from being killed by Nagato. Nagato, his personality now suppressed, tried capturing them with Chibaku Tensei, which the three combined efforts to destroy. While Nagato was distracted by their attack, Itachi sealed him with Susanoo. His personality restored, Nagato used his last moments to apologise and put his faith in Naruto. Afterwards, Itachi destroyed the crow, its Kotoamatsukami too valuable to let fall into the wrong hands. He left to find Kabuto so that he could end the Impure World Reincarnation, but not before telling Naruto to let his friends support him and leaving Sasuke's reform to him.

Mujun
Naruto defeats the Third Raikage.

A shadow clone arrived at the site of the Fourth Division's battle with various reincarnated Kage. Naruto was able to land a sneak attack on Mū, allowing the Third Tsuchikage to seal him before he could say anything. The Tsuchikage went to help Gaara fight the Second Mizukage, leaving Naruto to fight the Third Raikage along with the other members of the Fourth Division. Like the Fourth Raikage, the Third was very fast, easily dodging most attacks. The few attacks that did land had almost no effect, his body's natural defence was too high, and the Raikage's offences allowed him to break through every attempt to contain him. When Naruto noticed that the Raikage had a scar from his fight with the Eight-Tails years earlier, he contacted it via B to ask how the Raikage received the scar. Upon hearing the Eight-Tails' answer, Naruto surmises the scar was self-inflicted, confirming it as he manipulates the Third into piercing his own body. The Third is sealed and Naruto regroups with the Tsuchikage and Gaara, who already defeated the Second Mizukage.

As Naruto and B continued onwards, Naruto's shadow clones started arriving at various locations. In the anime, shadow clones were able to: save the members of the Sasuke Recovery Team from the reincarnated Sound Four's Space–Time Technique Formula: Underworld Turnover;[149] update Tatewaki about the fates of the children he was responsible for during life, granting him peace and allowing him to return to the afterlife;[150] run in to Yota, a childhood friend, and giving Yota a chance to play with him again before releasing himself from the Impure World Reincarnation;[151][152][153] assist Omoi in saving the Thundercloud Unit.[154]

Fourth Shinobi World War: Climax
Main article: Fourth Shinobi World War: Climax
Shadow clones arrived at all the remaining battlefields, securing Impure World Reincarnations, weeding out the Zetsu that had infiltrated the Alliance's ranks, and defeating any other remaining Zetsu. Victory seemed near when the Sensor Division detected a new threat near the Fourth Division: Mu, who split himself before his sealing, and the reincarnated Madara Uchiha. Shocked by this revelation, they all wondered who the masked man, Tobi, really was. Madara gave them little time to discuss it and attacked them immediately. He cut swaths through the Fourth Division's ranks and used his Rinnegan to avoid the clone's, the Tsuchikage's, and Gaara's counterattack. Wishing to eliminate them all at once, Madara dropped a meteorite on them.

Kurama helps Naruto
Naruto receives help from the Nine-Tails.

While the survivors regroup, Madara tried to summon the Nine-Tails. Although it failed, the fox sensed the attempt and offered some chakra to help fight Madara, preferring Naruto over the Uchiha. The shadow clone used the Nine-Tails' chakra to counter Madara's Nativity of a World of Trees with Big Ball Spiralling Serial Zone Spheres, though the extended fighting left the clone exhausted afterwards. Madara moved in to capture it, but was parried by the arrival of Tsunade, the Fourth Raikage, and the Fifth Mizukage. The Five Kage vowed to deal with Madara themselves and asked that Naruto should instead focus on defeating Tobi. The clone dispersed just as the real Naruto converged on Tobi. Naruto and B clashed with Tobi's reincarnated jinchūriki, styled like a Six Paths of Pain. During the fighting, Naruto referenced another Madara and asked who Tobi really was. Realising his lie was exposed, Tobi refused to accept any particular identity, believing it to be irrelevant. Naruto was not satisfied with this answer and vowed to break Tobi's mask.

Jinchūriki clashes
Naruto and B clash with the reincarnated jinchūriki.

B entered Tailed Beast Mode to clear the surrounding forest that was giving him and Naruto a disadvantage against the reincarnated jinchūriki. He then tried to seal the jinchūriki, but Tobi had them enter Version 2 forms to escape at the last second. The increased strength of the jinchūriki caused difficulties for Naruto and B. Tobi, taking advantage of the situation, nearly captured Naruto, but was blocked by the arrival of Kakashi and Guy. Their arrival balanced out the two sides, so Tobi had the Four-Tails and the Six-Tails enter Tailed Beast Modes as well. The Four-Tails captured Naruto in its mouth, allowing it to communicate with him. The Four-Tails, introducing itself with the name Son Gokū, was angered to be controlled by Tobi, but it doubted Naruto would be any better since humans had always sought to control it and its fellow tailed beasts. Naruto insisted he was different and Son Gokū, touched by his desire to help it, told him how to release it from Tobi's control. Naruto managed to break out of its mouth, locate the black receiver, and remove it.

Kurama teams up
Naruto and Kurama unite.

Son Gokū thanked Naruto for his help, but explained that it couldn't actually be saved, as it was still bound to the Demonic Statue of the Outer Path. Before it was pulled back into the Demonic Statue, Son Gokū gave some of its chakra to Naruto and wished him luck. Tobi, having lost the use of one tailed beast, forced the others to enter Tailed Beast Modes so that the battle could be brought to an end. The Nine-Tails remarked that Naruto couldn't possibly win without its help. Naruto stated that he was not up for taking its chakra by force at the moment and that he would figure something out. However, Naruto's earlier determination to help Son Gokū moved the Nine-Tails, reminding it of the many selfless things Naruto had done during his life and the perseverance he always displayed. The Nine-Tails no longer wanted to oppose Naruto and instead offered to join him as a partner, asking only that Naruto call it by name: Kurama.

Seishin Sekai
Naruto meets the tailed beasts.

Naruto entered his own Tailed Beast Mode and went to save Kakashi and Guy, deflecting the other five beasts' Tailed Beast Balls. The Kurama avatar fought the beasts in close combat, forcing them to combine their Tailed Beast Balls into one against it. Kurama countered theirs with a single one of its own Tailed Beast Balls and Naruto then used the avatar's tails to grab and remove the beasts' black receivers. From the contact, Naruto was able to interface with the other beasts, who introduced themselves and, like Son Gokū, gave him portions of their chakra. Tobi recalled the beasts back into the Demonic Statue and, though irritated, remained confident in his eventual victory as he faced off with Naruto, B, Kakashi, and Guy. By the time night fell, however, Tobi was still unable to defeat them. A light eventually descended on the reincarnated jinchūriki that B had kept restrained, returning them to the afterlife and signalling that Itachi had finally defeated Kabuto.

Naruto destroys the mask of Tobi

With his options running out, Tobi deposited the Benihisago and the Kohaku no Jōhei (which contained portions of Kurama's chakra) into the Demonic Statue which, combined with a fragment of the Eight-Tails, Gyūki's, chakra he acquired previously, was enough to start the revival of the Ten-Tails. Naruto, B, Kakashi, and Guy started focusing on destroying it, but were constantly stopped by Tobi and his peculiar teleportation and intangibility abilities. From the fighting, however, Kakashi noticed that Tobi's abilities were seemingly linked to his own Kamui. To take advantage of this, Kakashi had one of Naruto's shadow clones attack Tobi and, just as the clone was about to be destroyed by one of Tobi's attacks, Kakashi used Kamui on it without Tobi noticing. Naruto then attacked with a Tailed Beast Ball, which Tobi escaped by retreating to Kamui's dimension. He found the clone waiting for him there and it destroyed his mask with a Rasengan.

When they saw his face, Guy and Kakashi recognised Tobi as their childhood friend, Obito Uchiha, whom they'd long thought dead. Obito declined to explain his actions to them and instead attacked, which attracted Madara, who escaped the release of the Impure World Reincarnation, to their location. Seeing Madara, Naruto asked what happened to the Kage, to which the elder Uchiha replied that they were in bad condition when he left them. From that and the conversation he overheard between Madara and Obito, particularly their manipulation of Nagato, Naruto attacked in a rage. Madara reflected him and then tried to capture him and B so that the Ten-Tails could be revived in its complete form. Naruto split his attention, he and B fighting Madara's wood dragon with their Tailed Beast Modes and one of his shadow clones trying to help Kakashi get over the revelation that Obito was alive.

Allied Forces Jutsu
Naruto with the Allied Shinobi Forces.

Obito tried to convince Naruto of the futility of resistance. Naruto insisted that protecting his comrades was always worthwhile, no matter how hopeless things may seem. His words brought Kakashi out of his slump, enabling him to start fighting Obito on his own, and energised Guy, who created an opening for Naruto and B to attack the Demonic Statue with a combined Tailed Beast Ball. The attack came too late, however, and the Ten-Tails was revived. Naruto, B, Kakashi, and Guy regrouped and coordinated an attack, but the Ten-Tails was too powerful and Madara and Obito, once they linked themselves to it, were able to deploy its powers effectively. Just before they could kill Naruto and the others, the combined remaining Allied Shinobi Forces arrived to help. Shikaku Nara, communicating to all of them from the Alliance's headquarters, staged an offensive to restrain the Ten-Tails. Although it failed, it was effective enough that Madara and Obito had the Ten-Tails destroy the distant headquarters, killing Shikaku and everyone else stationed there.

The Allies made individual attacks against the Ten-Tails, but none had any effect. At the same time, the Ten-Tails started raining wooden skewers all over the battlefield, killing many. When one was about to hit Naruto, Hinata shielded him with her body and Neji shielded her with his own. Dying, Neji collapsed on Naruto's shoulder, asking him to be more careful in the future since many lives, Hinata's particularly, now depend on his. With his last breath, he thanked Naruto for calling him a genius all those years ago. Naruto was deeply distraught by Neji's death, which Obito tried to use as an example of the needless death that resistance caused and that could be solved in the new world he wanted to create. Hinata brought Naruto back to his senses by reminding him of all the people who had given their lives to protect him and whose memories he would be insulting if he had given up now. As Naruto thanked her, he took her hand and coated her with some of Kurama's chakra.

Naruto powered the Alliance up
Naruto gives chakra to the Allied Shinobi Forces.

Naruto shared Kurama's chakra throughout the Allied Forces, increasing their strength and protecting them from harm. They all manoeuvred into a formation that Shikaku was able to communicate to them before he died and, taking the form of a bird in memory of Neji, successfully removed the Ten-Tails from Obito and Madara's control. Forced to fend for themselves, Obito sought out Naruto, criticising him for wasting his energy protecting others. Naruto replied that protecting them actually gave him strength, motivating everyone within earshot. They then sensed the Ten-Tails was about to attack, which Kakashi tried to stop with Kamui. Obito intercepted him and they teleported away, leaving the others to endure the Ten-Tails' Tenpenchii. Kurama's chakra protected everyone, but it faded in the aftermath; Naruto was left quite beaten up, requiring Sakura to heal him. When the Ten-Tails attacked with another Tailed Beast Ball, the Allies mustered what little defence they could. Before it could reach them, however, the Tailed Beast Ball was suddenly teleported away and Naruto's reincarnated father, Minato Namikaze, appeared at Naruto's side.

Team 7 Reunited
Team 7 reunites.

The First, Second, and Third Hokage arrived soon afterward and, along with Minato, erected a barrier around the Ten-Tails to confine it. Sasuke arrived shortly too, at whose request the previous Hokage were reincarnated by Orochimaru and who now opposed Obito and Madara. Their fellow Rookie Nine had set aside their differences with Sasuke for the time being and joined forces in launching an attack against the Ten-Tails' cruft. On Sai's advice, Naruto, Sasuke, and Sakura all summoned their signature animals (Naruto calling on Gamakichi) in order to focus directly on the Ten-Tails itself. Naruto and Sasuke successfully damaged the Ten-Tails' arm with a combined Scorch Release: Halo Hurricane Jet Black Arrow Style Zero, but it merely removed the arm to prevent the flames of Sasuke's Amaterasu from spreading.

Before they could attack again, Obito returned, landing on top of the Ten-Tails head and seemingly about to use the Samsara of Heavenly Life Technique to restore Madara to life. While everyone focused on stopping Obito, Naruto couldn't help but notice that the hand seals he was using were different from what Nagato used. Minato tried to cut Obito down, but discovered that it was too late as he sealed the Ten-Tails into his body, becoming its jinchūriki.

Shuriken hits Obito
Naruto and Sasuke attack Obito.

Obito used his new power to destroy the barrier, forcing the Hokage to put the energy they were using toward the barrier into the fight instead. Because they had immortal bodies, they launched the first attack so that the others could learn what they could about Obito's new abilities, but they were quickly defeated. Naruto and Sasuke engaged him as well, but were nearly killed, saved only by Naruto using his chakra arms to link to Minato so he could teleport them to safety. Just as before, Naruto and Sasuke combined their attacks, having Minato and the Second Hokage coordinate teleports so that the attack would connect. Obito's Truth-Seeking Balls dissipated much of the attack and the damage that he did incur was quickly regenerated.

From the development and some of the previous exchanges, Minato concluded that Obito was able to neutralise ninjutsu. Gamakichi, wanting to make some final contribution to the fight before he was forced to return to Mount Myōboku, attacked with his Starch Syrup Gun. Minato took this opportunity to try and reason with Obito, reminding him of his former dream to become Hokage. Obito berated the title and those who had held it, as he had surpassed them. Naruto was insulted not only because that was a slight against his father, but also because he hadn't abandoned his dream of being Hokage like Obito had. The Second Hokage teleported him to Obito and he attacked with a Rasengan, which successfully damaged Obito; Naruto noticed that Gamakichi's attack wasn't neutralised and realised Obito was vulnerable to senjutsu.

Minato and Naruto bump fists
Kurama and its jinchūriki join forces.

With a weakness discovered, Obito trapped the Alliance in a barrier and began charging multiple Tailed Beast Balls that he would use to wipe out everyone within its confines. Minato noted that he wouldn't be able to teleport them all away in time, so Naruto came up with a different approach: he linked his chakra with Minato and remotely restored the Alliance's chakra cloaks, networking everyone in with Minato's Flying Thunder God Technique, allowing him to teleport everyone out of the barrier. Minato did so and was afterwards very proud of his son, saying he wished they had more time to talk. Naruto replied that it was not necessary since he already met his mother and that she explained everything. Naruto and Minato each entered Tailed Beast Modes, with Naruto merging his with Sage Mode in order to imbue their shared Rasengan with senjutsu. The Second teleported them to Obito and they attacked, but he blocked it with his Truth-Seeking Balls.

Obito vs Titans
A senjutsu-enhanced Naruto and Sasuke attack Obito.

To move ahead with his plans, Obito created a replica of the God Tree, the first step in performing the Infinite Tsukuyomi. The tree started absorbing chakra from those nearby until they die, a fate that Naruto nearly succumbed to until he was saved by the Third Hokage. Obito pointed to the growing number of casualties as further evidence that Naruto should stop resisting, an argument that Naruto was increasingly having trouble ignoring. Sasuke, unmoved by Obito's words, used Susanoo to hack through the tree and then mocked Naruto for giving up. Naruto was reminded of his desire to not lose Sasuke or anyone else for that matter and, reinvigorated, joined Sasuke in the offensive. Although their senjutsu-enhanced Tailed Beast Mode and Susanoo could compete with Obito, they were individually unable to defeat him. Obito continued trying to convince Naruto to stop, but he ignored him.

Obito is taken down

Sasuke then coated his Susanoo around Naruto's Tailed Beast Mode, granting the Kurama-avatar a sword and armour. Sensing that it was the final exchange, Obito created a sword and shield of his own out of Truth-Seeking Balls. Naruto created a Rasengan in each of the Kurama-avatar's tails, which his friends from Konoha guide in a coordinated assault to Obito's shield, destroying it. As soon as Naruto and Sasuke sliced through Obito with their sword, the tailed beasts then began to emerge from the Uchiha's body, giving Naruto and the combined Allied Shinobi Forces the opportunity to pull them out. The tug-of-war for the tailed beasts linked Naruto's consciousness with Obito's. Naruto reminded Obito of his earlier claim that he was nobody and set out to prove to him that he was Obito Uchiha, specifically the Obito Uchiha that Kakashi used to know. Naruto pointed out their similarities, how both were orphans and that, because of that, they wanted to be Hokage. Obito agreed that they were similar, but that was the reason why he has been trying so hard to convince Naruto that he was right, and insisted that the world he wanted to create was a better one because his vision of the future was clear, whereas the future of the current world was ambiguous. Naruto argued that was the point and that uncertainty, when faced with comrades, was worthwhile, and offered Obito his hand so that they might see what happened together.

Kurama extracted from Naruto
Kurama is extracted from Naruto by Madara.

The Allies successfully removed the tailed beasts from Obito and he fell to the ground, defeated. Minato and Kakashi insisted that Obito be left to them while Naruto and the rest of the Alliance should focus on Madara. They did so, joining forces with the First Hokage against him, but right before he could seal him, Madara put one final fail-safe into effect: he had Black Zetsu force Obito to revive him. Madara quickly neutralised the First, fended off Naruto, Sasuke, and Sai, and then went after the freed tailed beasts. Naruto entered Tailed Beast Mode and assisted them with fighting him off. They were initially successful, but when Madara reacquired one of his Rinnegan, he easily defeated them with Limbo: Border Jail, sealing them all back into the Demonic Statue, including B's Gyūki and Naruto's Kurama.

Obito Saving Naruto
Obito transfers his tailed beasts' chakra into Naruto.

The removal of Kurama from his body caused Naruto to pass out and placed his life in immediate danger. His Uzumaki heritage prevented him from dying instantly, but he required constant medical attention from Sakura in order to keep him alive. On the advice of Kurama right before it was extracted, Gaara took Naruto to Minato so that Minato's portion of Kurama's chakra could be sealed into him, saving him. Kakashi sent Naruto and Sakura to Kamui's dimension so that she could continue performing life support without interruption. Obito soon arrived to help her, having overcome both Black Zetsu and Madara in order to acquire Minato's half of Kurama and give it to Naruto, as his form of penance.

Naruto & Sasuke obtain Rikudo Power
Naruto and Sasuke accept Hagoromo's power.

While on the border of life and death, Naruto was met by the Sage of Six Paths, Hagoromo Ōtsutsuki. He explained his past conflicts with his mother, Kaguya Ōtsutsuki, and the conflicts that emerged between his sons, Asura and Indra. His sons' conflict had continued through the centuries, with their chakra reincarnated every generation in new individuals to fight anew; Naruto was the current reincarnation of Asura, while Sasuke was the reincarnation of Indra. Naruto was not greatly surprised, having sensed something like that when he met Sasuke during the Five Kage Summit. Because of Madara's aims for the world, Hagoromo asked that he and Sasuke join forces to stop him, a task he was only encouraged by from the tailed beasts' positive words concerning Naruto. He gave Naruto the Six Paths Yang Power, half his chakra and Six Paths Sage Mode to help him in this goal.

Madara Attacked
Naruto and Sasuke strike Madara.

When Naruto woke up, he had Obito send him back to the real world. There, he stopped Madara from killing Might Guy and used Hagoromo's power to stabilise Guy's life force from using the Eight Gates Released Formation. Surprised by Naruto's sudden increase in power, Madara was hit by Naruto's Sage Art: Lava Release Rasenshuriken, which was fueled by Son Gokū's chakra and instantly cut down the giant tree Obito created earlier. When Sasuke arrived, Naruto entered Six Paths Sage Mode and they started overwhelming Madara. Realising his window was closing, Madara went after Kakashi and took his Mangekyō Sharingan, using it to follow Obito. Sakura appeared shortly afterward, sent by Obito so Madara wouldn't kill her. She could do nothing about Kakashi's eye, so Naruto used Hagoromo's power to restore the one he lost years ago.

Clones vs Shadows
Naruto's clones facing Madara's clones.

Madara soon returned, now having both his Rinnegan and Black Zetsu in control of Obito's body. Naruto and Sasuke immediately resumed their attack, but Madara had an easier time with them. He rose into the sky, raining Chibaku Tensei on them to keep them busy while he projected the Infinite Tsukuyomi on the world. While Naruto destroyed the remaining satellite-like constructs, Sasuke shielded him, Sakura, and Kakashi with Susanoo from the Infinite Tsukuyomi's gaze. He let them out once the illusion was finished casting and they emerged to find themselves alone, with the rest of the world being wrapped into Madara's God: Nativity of a World of Trees. As Madara confronted them and started explaining how he had saved the world, he was stabbed in the back by Black Zetsu. Black Zetsu then transferred to Madara's body from Obito's and forced him to absorb the world's chakra, converting him into a woman that Naruto and Sasuke recognised as Kaguya Ōtsutsuki.

Kaguya Ōtsutsuki Strikes
Main article: Kaguya Ōtsutsuki Strikes
Kaguya detected that Naruto and Sasuke as the reincarnations of Asura and Indra, and also that her son Hagoromo had given them the power to defeat her. Not wanting to further the damage the world that their fighting would cause, she shifted them all to one of her dimensions, placing them above a sea of lava. Sasuke summoned his hawk Garuda to save himself and Naruto, but ignored Naruto's pleas to save Sakura, Kakashi, and Obito too since only he and Naruto were vital to the fight. Kakashi was able to briefly stop their fall, but the heat burned the scroll he used to save them and it was only Naruto's sudden discovery that he was able to levitate that saved them from the lava. He left a shadow clone to hold onto them and engaged Kaguya, creating an opening for Sasuke to attack.

Kaguya Freezes Boys
Kaguya thwarts Naruto and Sasuke's sealing attempt.

Sasuke's attack failed and Naruto must save him from the lava. With their attacks ineffective and the environment such a hazard, Naruto and Sasuke discussed what to do. Kaguya appeared behind them and paralysed them, binding them with Black Zetsu while she started absorbing their chakra. Black Zetsu took the opportunity to expand on the history earlier given by Hagoromo, painting Kaguya as the victim of her sons, Hagoromo and Hamura. Black Zetsu had for centuries been manipulating others toward the outcome of reviving her, and only then had it finally succeeded. It encouraged them to bask in the embrace of their oblivion, but Naruto refused, breaking himself and Sasuke free. Needing to take drastic action, Naruto used his "ultimate" jutsu: Sexy: Reverse Harem Technique. Kaguya was so distracted that she was nearly sealed, but she recomposed herself in time to shift dimensions again, freezing Naruto and Sasuke in place.

Naruto Region Combo
Naruto overwhelms Kaguya with shadow clones.

Because Naruto and Sasuke were only a threat to her when together, Kaguya sent Sasuke to a different dimension while she focused on Naruto. While Kaguya manipulated the ice dimension against him, his shadow clone explained to Kakashi, Sakura, and the now-awake Obito that his and Sasuke's powers were both necessary to defeat her. Obito offered to use his Kamui to try and explore Kaguya's dimensions to find Sasuke. To give Obito an opening, Naruto used Naruto Region Combo to overwhelm Kaguya, forcing her to retreat to another dimension to get her bearings. When she did so, Obito infiltrated the dimension Kaguya went to with Sakura and the shadow clone. The shadow clone faced her so that she wouldn't notice them while they look for Sasuke. Kaguya returned to the ice dimension and resumed her fight with the army of Naruto's clones. He kept her preoccupied until Obito returned with Sasuke.

Naruto Attacks Kaguya
Naruto separates Black Zetsu from Kaguya.

Increasingly frustrated, Kaguya shifted them to another dimension with powerful gravity to immobilise Naruto and Sasuke while she attacked with her All-Killing Ash Bones. Kakashi and Obito used themselves to shield the attack, with Obito then using Kamui to protect Kakashi, leaving Obito unable to defend himself. Naruto tried to heal the damage to his body, but even Hagoromo's power couldn't save him. While Sasuke fought Kaguya, Obito thanked Naruto for reminding him of who he was and made him promise to become Hokage for both their sakes. Naruto agreed and Obito's body crumbled. Black Zetsu ridiculed Obito for living an insignificant life and dying an insignificant death. Enraged, Naruto severed Kaguya's arm, in the sleeve of which Black Zetsu had been hiding, and then pinned it to the ground with his Truth-Seeking Balls.

Kaguya's Defeat
Team 7 defeats Kaguya.

Naruto and his shadow clones attacked Kaguya with Sage Art: Super Tailed Beast Rasenshuriken. On impact, the tailed beasts' chakra within her began reacting and Kaguya started losing control of her form. She was able to reconfigure herself and prepared an Expansive Truth-Seeking Ball to destroy them. Kakashi interfered, using Susanoo (a last gift from Obito) to make an opening for Naruto and Sasuke. She tried to escape, but Sakura punched her to keep her in place, allowing Naruto and Sasuke to trigger Six Paths — Chibaku Tensei. The tailed beasts were removed from her, Madara was spat out, and she was entombed in her own dimension. Not wanting Black Zetsu to scheme for her release again, Naruto made a point to trap it with her but not before telling it that a spoiled brat like it has no right to compare itself with the men and women who truly shaped shinobi history.

Minato leaving Naruto
Minato wishes happy birthday to Naruto.

Team 7 wondered how they would return to their world. Sensing their need, Hagoromo combined the efforts of the dead Kage to summon them, the tailed beasts, and Madara back. Hagoromo thanked them for saving the world, as did the tailed beasts for saving them. Naruto happily greeted to his original Kurama, asking if it missed him, to which the flustered fox denied. After Madara died from his ordeal, Naruto met with Minato who, as day broke, wished him a happy seventeenth birthday. As Hagoromo returned Minato's and the souls of the other dead Kage to the Pure Land, Minato voiced his pride in Naruto and promised to tell Kushina everything about him. The other Kage also gave words of parting, which Naruto tearfully accepted.

With all threats gone, Hagoromo explained that the Infinite Tsukuyomi could be released if Naruto and Sasuke combine their chakra. Sasuke agreed to this, but first he wanted to kill the Kage and destroy the tailed beasts, believing both were inhibitive to world peace. When he was unwilling to back down from his threat, the tailed beasts moved in to stop Sasuke, but he captured each in their own Chibaku Tensei. Hagoromo recognised that as a continuation of Indra's feud with Asura, but lacked the time and power to do anything about it. Sakura tried to reason with Sasuke, but he knocked her out and left. Naruto followed after him, promising to Hagoromo that he would bring him around and finally end the centuries-long feud.

Naruto vs
Naruto and Sasuke begin their rematch at the Valley of the End.

Naruto and Sasuke ended up at the Valley of the End, where they fought years ago. Sasuke stated his willingness to bear the world's burdens by himself and live independently of the past, neither of which Naruto believed were possible, or at least wise. He tells Sasuke it's impossible to do everything alone like he plans to, pointing to the missteps Itachi made and their own successful teamwork against Kaguya. Sasuke replies that he only wants to remake a better world, one where he can, like Itachi before, be solely responsible for the difficult decisions that must be made so that nobody else needs to; this is what he believes a true "Hokage" to be. Naruto insists he will be Hokage, not Sasuke, because Sasuke is still going against what Itachi wanted for him and they start fighting.

Kurama vs Susanoo
Naruto and Sasuke's attacks collide.

After a brief exchange of blows reminiscent of their fight years ago, Naruto and Sasuke started trading punches with their Tailed Beast Mode and Susanoo respectively. Sasuke chastised Naruto for not attacking with an intent to kill, but Naruto, like last time, was unwilling to do so, not wishing for either of them to go without the other. Naruto then clashed his Tailed Beast Ball with Sasuke's Susanoo-supported Chidori, producing a large explosion that does noticeable but not debilitating damage to their respective avatars. Each therefore powered up the avatars, Sasuke by channelling the captured tailed beasts into his Susanoo and Naruto by merging his avatar with the avatars of two shadow clones. The two met attacks once again, creating a giant explosion that stripped away their avatars and left them with too little chakra to use practically. They instead resorted to taijutsu, kicking and punching each other into the night.

Sasuke Vs Naruto
Naruto and Sasuke's final clash.

As the two battled near exhaustion, Kurama mustered enough chakra for Naruto to make one last attack, but Sasuke absorbed it. Having expected this, Naruto delivered a solid punch, finally irritating Sasuke over the endless repetition of their fight. Kurama gave the last of its chakra to Naruto, who used it to make a Rasengan to counter Sasuke's Chidori. Both woke up later to find that much of the Valley of the End had been destroyed, that they had each lost an arm, and that neither could move. Sasuke reflected that Naruto had been a constant obstacle to his goals, but that he was also the only person who never given up on him. Naruto's usual response that they were friends didn't convince Sasuke since it obviously went beyond, so Naruto elaborated that he experienced pain if he didn't have Sasuke. Sasuke was awed, knowing full well that Naruto had experienced various misfortunes in his life, smiled through all of them, yet would suffer without Sasuke.

Naruto & Sasuke Wounded
Naruto and Sasuke reconnect.

When they woke up the next day, Sasuke admitted defeat for the first time in his life, as he came to accept that Naruto was just as vital to him as he was to Naruto. Kakashi and Sakura eventually tracked them down and Sakura healed them, though she couldn't do anything about their missing arms. Once they were able to walk, they returned to where the Allied Shinobi Forces were all trapped still, dispelled the Infinite Tsukuyomi according to Hagoromo's instructions, and Sasuke released the tailed beasts. With the war over, Naruto returns to the village, where he attends a mass funeral for the participants of the war. In the anime, while recovering from his injuries, Gaara and A approach Naruto and thank him for his effort during the war. Shikamaru later brings Naruto to the Academy to meet with Iruka and Kakashi, who is considering on promoting Naruto as a jōnin. However, because he never got to retake the Chūnin Exams, Naruto has to complete two years worth of studies, much to his dismay. However, Naruto is cheered up as Iruka offers to help him.[155]

Hinata:
----------------
Hinata is a kunoichi of Konohagakure. Formerly the heiress of the Hyūga clan, she lost the position upon being deemed unsuited for the responsibilities of leading the clan. Nonetheless, Hinata persevered and from her observation of Naruto Uzumaki especially, Hinata found an example to follow. Through her membership with Team 8, she sought to become strong enough to change herself, if even a little at a time. 
As a child, Hinata was soft-spoken and polite, always addressing people with proper honourifics. She is kind, always thinking of others more than for herself, caring for their feelings and well-being. She doesn't like being confrontational for any reason. This led to her being meek or timid to others, as her overwhelming kindness can render her unable to respond or act for fear of offending somebody.[14] Her father's constant push to alter this personality trait when she was younger only made it worse, eroding Hinata's self-confidence and making her even more bashful because she gained so little faith in herself and opinions.[3] Despite being disinherited, Hinata loves her family very much,
Hinata's outlook sees a shift after her appointment to Team 8. Whereas her father and much of the Hyūga clan had decided she was a lost cause who would never amount to anything,[15] her team considers her a valuable member with her special strong points. Originally, she would over-rely on her teammates, looking to them in times of difficulty to save her from situations that make her uncomfortable. It is for her teammates - among other reasons - that Hinata starts seeking to change herself, as she wishes to help the team rather than burden it.[16]

Hinata's dream
Hinata dreams of being with Naruto.

Hinata's primary motivation is Naruto Uzumaki, with whom she has been fascinated since meeting him. He initially gained her attention because of his kindness to her and outspoken nature, and then kept her attention because of similarities that Hinata perceived to herself: Naruto had a painful childhood without the love of parents, a fate worse than the mere difficulty she had with her own father, and he craves the attention and acknowledgement of anybody, just as Hinata wants to please her father.[17] But whereas Hinata lost faith in herself, Naruto always believed he can accomplish any given task if he tries hard enough. She admires him deeply for this courage and over time fell deeply in love with him, which manifests as increased shyness and speechlessness when around him, something that became apparent to everyone, apart from ironically Naruto himself. Hinata strives to prove herself to others, but mostly to gain the attention and worthiness of Naruto. She emulates him to this purpose, adopting his nindō of never giving up to improve herself. To that end, she stops running from confrontation, instead doing all that she can to face it, even in the face of failure to keep trying, and willing to risk her life for her loved ones and village.[18] By the end of Part I, her clan's faith in her is restored and strengthened.[19]

Scary Hinata
Hinata's intimidating demeanour.

Throughout the years, Naruto remains her primary motivation; she willingly faced Pain to protect Naruto, despite knowing she has no chance of winning.[20] She even defends Naruto from himself when he's in doubt, repeating to him his refusal to never give up.[21]Appearance
Hinata is a slender girl of fair-complexion who, as a Hyūga, her most distinguishing trait is the Byakugan, giving her featureless white eyes (lavender in the anime). She has dark blue hair that she keeps in a bob-cut of different lengths: in Part I, her hair is cut just above her forehead akin to a bowl-cut with chin-length strands framing her face; in Part II, her hair reaches her lower back and the framing strands reach shoulder-length; in The Last: Naruto the Movie, her hair extends beyond her hips and she would at times tie it into a ponytail. By the time Boruto entered the Academy, she cut it into a bob-style reaching her shoulders.[25] She is noted to be beautiful by Naruto[12] and Toneri Ōtsutsuki.

Hinata in Part I.
Hinata in Part I.
1/3
In Part I, Hinata usually wears a cream-coloured hooded-jacket with a fire symbol on the upper sleeves and fur around the cuffs and hem. She also wears navy blue pants and keeps her forehead protector loosely around her neck. In Part II, she dons a lavender and cream hooded-jacket with lavender cuffs over mesh armour. She also wears navy blue pants, black, low-heeled sandals, and changes the cloth of her forehead protector from blue to black. Hinata switches to the standard Konoha infantry flak jacket and assorted clothing during the Fourth Shinobi World War, though she does not appear to wear a forehead protector.
Originally, Hinata's gentle personality hindered her performance, to which she was deemed too weak and unworthy for the role of heir.[26] After committing herself getting stronger in her training for Naruto, receiving consistent praise from her team and clan for her improving skills and strengthening character.[27][20][18] 

Chakra Prowess and Control
Twin Lions Crumbling Attack
Hinata's Gentle Step: Twin Lion Fist using Hamura's chakra.

From her special clan training, Hinata has advanced control of her chakra. In the anime, Hinata's additional training during Part I resulted in her ability to free herself from contraints[29] and manipulate nearby water sources, turning them into projectiles.[30] By Part II of the anime, Hinata's control has advanced enough to match a medical-nin's, for which reason she is assigned to help perform the Four-Corner Sealing Barrier.

s a Hyūga, Hinata possesses the Byakugan, a dōjutsu that grants her penetrative vision in a near-360° around herself, with one blind spot at the back of the neck above the first thoracic vertebra.[31] With it, she is able to assist others frequently in tracking, scouting the area for their target(s); by focusing her vision in a single direction, Hinata can see across vast distances, able to see at least 1 kilometre during her first Chūnin Exam, and reaching as far away as 20 kilometres by the battle against Toneri. Hinata's Byakugan grants her attacks pinpoint accuracy, which she can share with others to also improve their own.[32] She can also use it in order to identify genjutsu, searching for the caster in the nearby area.[33] In the anime, Hinata can use infrared vision and magnify in to see tiny targets.[34] 

Physical Prowess
As is traditional in her clan, Hinata has been extensively trained in the Gentle Fist fighting style. In unison with her Byakugan, Hinata can attack accurately target an individuals' chakra pathway systems and the 361 tenketsu that run along it, constricting or cutting off their chakra flow from only minimal contact.[15] Although this enables Hinata to attack an opponent's internal organs, she can also use it in a supplementary function, such as by setting dislocated shoulders back in place.[36]

Hakke Kūhekishō
Hinata and Neji combining their Eight Trigrams Vacuum Palms.

While Hinata hadn't yet mastered her clan's most advanced techniques in Part I, in the anime, she created the Protecting Eight Trigrams Sixty-Four Palms as an alternative, which effectively protects her and attacks anything within range with sharp streams of chakra emitted from her palms.[37] By Part II, she had grown accustomed to more of her clan's techniques. During Pain's Assault, Hinata could use the Gentle Step Twin Lion Fists, a technique that drains the target of their chakra where struck. During the Fourth Shinobi World War, Hinata could use the Eight Trigrams Vacuum Palm to attack targets outside her physical range or deflect incoming attacks,[38] which increases in power if used in conjunction with others.[39] She also mastered the Eight Trigrams Sixty-Four Palms in the war.[40] By the time she reaches adulthood, she became well-known for her mastery of the Gentle Fist.[41

Ninjutsu
While Hinata doesn't usually use ninjutsu, by the Fourth Shinobi World War, her nature transformations included Fire and Lightning Release.[4] In the anime, she also demonstrated proficiency in medical ninjutsu, able to use the Mystical Palm Technique to heal the wounded.[44]
Prologue — Land of Waves
Main article: Prologue — Land of Waves
In the anime, while the graduates of her Academy class are being assigned to teams, Hinata hopes that she will be on the same team as Naruto Uzumaki. To her disappointment, she is instead added to Kurenai Yūhi's Team 8, along with Kiba Inuzuka and Shino Aburame. Kurenai reports this to Hinata's father, Hiashi Hyūga, but he is unconcerned and in fact abandons Hinata to Kurenai's care, feeling she is unworthy of the Hyūga clan.[15]

Chūnin Exams
Main article: Chūnin Exams
Naruto and hinata at first exam
Hinata lets Naruto copy her test.

Despite how recently they graduated from the Academy, Kurenai enters Team 8 in the Chūnin Exams being held in Konoha; Hinata agrees to participate because she wants to change herself. For the exams' first stage, Hinata is seated next to Naruto as they take a written test. The objective in the first stage is to cheat off of other examinee's paper without getting caught, but Naruto doesn't realise this and agonises about potentially failing. Seeing this, Hinata offers to let him copy off of her paper. He suspects she's trying to trick him, but she assures him that she only wants to be helpful. Although he considers taking her up on her offer, Naruto ultimately declines, fearing that he'll get her disqualified if they're caught and claiming that, besides, he isn't the type to cheat.

Although Naruto is given the opportunity to forfeit, he refuses to do so, and for his determination, he passes the first stage along with Hinata and their teams. For the second stage, participants enter the Forest of Death with the objective of obtaining a set of two scrolls, one of which they are given at the start. Team 8 manages to collect their second scroll right after the second stage has started, and so they head for the centre of the forest where they're supposed to turn in the scrolls. Along the way, Kiba's partner, Akamaru, senses the Three Sand Siblings' fight with Team Shigure. Team 8 watches the fight from the cover of some nearby bushes and is horrified when Gaara mercilessly kills all of Team Shigure. After they're certain Gaara won't kill them too, they proceed to the centre of the forest.

After passing the second stage, the remaining participants take part in one-on-one preliminary matches. During Naruto's fight with Kiba, Hinata's loyalties are torn; she wants to cheer for Naruto, but fears that would be rude to Kiba. When Naruto wins the fight, Hinata gives both him and Kiba some of the Hyūga Clan Secret Ointment so that their wounds will heal faster. As he's being taken away to rest, Kiba pleads for Hinata to forfeit if she's matched against Gaara or her cousin, Neji Hyūga. She is indeed matched against the latter, a member of a Hyūga clan branch house who hates all members of the main house. Neji, like Kiba, tries to convince Hinata to forfeit, telling her that she's too meek and insecure to be a ninja. She begins to offer arguments in her defence, but Neji persists, claiming that she is fated to be a failure, a fact that he believes she's aware of due to her frightened reaction to what he says.

Gentle fist
Hinata fights Neji.

Neji's words cause Hinata to cry, but also anger the watching Naruto, who insists that Hinata can change herself if she wants to and who encourages her to defeat Neji. Because Naruto has faith in her, Hinata refuses to forfeit and prepares to fight; Neji is surprised by the new confidence in her. Hinata and Neji exchange Gentle Fist-blows, but only Neji's are effective, which he reveals to be because he sealed her tenketsu at the start of their fight. Although her attacks are ineffective against him, Hinata continues fighting, in the process enduring mounting internal trauma from Neji's counterattacks. Neji repeatedly tells her to forfeit, but Hinata refuses, unwilling to back down both as a matter of principle and because Naruto continues to cheer for her.

Shinobi Stop Neji
Hinata is saved from Neji.

Neji directly attacks Hinata's heart, leading all but Naruto to believe she's been defeated. When Hayate Gekkō is about to declare Neji the winner, Naruto stops him and motions to Hinata struggling to her feet. Neji tells her that her attempts to fight her destiny are only bringing her harm, but she rebuts that his own attempt to fight the destiny of the branch house brings him even more harm. Neji is enraged and attempts to kill her, but he is stopped by the observing jōnin. Hinata collapses, the damage to her organs being too severe, and before she loses consciousness she sees Naruto checking on her; she wonders if she managed to change at all. She's taken away by a team of medical-nin to be given emergency medical attention.

After a month, on the day of the Chūnin Exams' final matches, Hinata has recovered somewhat. Although she's supposed to take it easy, she practices at the Third Training Ground. Naruto stops there on his way to finals and is glad to see she's better. Because he's scheduled to fight Neji, Naruto shares his concerns that he might not be strong enough to defeat him. Hinata says that she believes he is strong enough, and that even if he isn't physically strong he still has strength of perseverance: a willingness to keep trying despite apparent failure until he finally conquers his obstacle. She admires him for that. Naruto is put at ease, thanks her, and informs her that his impression of her as "weird" was wrong, as he actually likes her. Hinata is left speechless as he walks away.

Hinata watches Naruto's fight against Neji with Kiba. Seeing Naruto receive so many of Neji's attacks upsets Hinata and causes her internal injuries to begin bleeding again. Kiba gets an Anbu (Kabuto Yakushi) to treat her. Although the Anbu heals her, she is rendered unconscious and thus is unable to watch Naruto's defeat of Neji.

When they are attacked by members of the Kamizuru clan, Hinata uses her new Protecting Eight Trigrams Sixty-Four Palms to save her team. Although they ultimately fail in their plan to use the bikōchū to find Sasuke, their near-success earns praise from Hinata's father, Hiashi.

Main article: In Naruto's Footsteps: The Friends' Paths
In the anime, Konoha and Sunagakure hold a joint Chūnin Exam two years after Naruto's departure, which Team 8 once again enters. During the first exam, Hinata, Kiba, and Shino are seated in different rooms and are tasked with getting a combined score of exactly 100 points on their written test despite their separation.[45] Neji comes up with the idea for teams to communicate which questions to answer by producing vibrations on the walls. After the initial testing period is over, they are given a bonus question: each team must unanimously select one of their members to disqualify from the rest of the exams. Team 8 selects nobody, which is the correct answer and which qualifies them for the next phase.[46]

Team Kurenai Chūnin Exams
Team 8 awaiting to begin the second stage of the Chūnin Exams.

Those who pass the first test must reach the Demon Desert within three days in order to participate in the second exam. Ultimately, Team 8 were among the first 30 teams to make it. The following night, as all the genin were ready to eat dinner, everyone grew nervous about the overly-sweaty Burami ruining the food, which caused the genin to quickly try to stop him, resulting in Neji using the Eight Trigrams Palms Revolving Heaven and accidentally destroying the food. As tension grew between everyone over the recent event, an all-out brawl began. Eventually everyone lost their desire to fight when Fū arrived with her optimistic ways. The following day, as the second exam began Team 8 were given the same objective as they had in the exam several years ago: obtain a scroll from another team.[47]

Following a simple plan by Kiba, Team 8 began talking loudly for all to hear, waiting for another team with a Heaven scroll to come after them. Ultimately, they encounter Team Kazami, with Hinata facing off against Kazami. Deciding to make the first move Hinata begins attacking Kazami. Realising Hinata's goal was to attack his Chakra Pathway System Kazami creates various sharp air currents which she counters using the Protecting Eight Trigrams Sixty-Four Palms. During the ensuing fight the other team is able to steal their scroll. Despite Team Kazami's attempts to prevent Team 8 from pursuing them, Shino is able to track them using his kikaichū.[48] During their search, Team 8 is ambushed by Team Kazami, though they are able to escape thanks to Shino's insect clone. They regroup and then reengage battle against Team Kazami, with Kiba ultimately defeating them. With their own scroll back and with Team Kazami's scroll now in their possession, Team 8 heads to the centre of the desert to turn in the scrolls.[49]

Team 8 eventually gets lost in a sandstorm along the way.[50] They are rescued by one of the exam's proctors, who brings them to where all of the other examinees are being assembled. They are informed that the Chūnin Exams have been cancelled; reports on the participants' performances will be sent back to their villages, leaving their promotion up to their superiors.

Suspecting a genjutsu is being used, Hinata searches the area with her Byakugan to locate a caster, but can find nobody. She focuses on Tobi's chakra signature to try and understand how his ability works, but is mystified when it simply vanishes. Tobi leaves them when he receives news that Itachi has died while fighting Sasuke. Hinata uses her Byakugan to locate where their fight took place and they rush to reach Sasuke before Tobi does, but they are too late and cannot rediscover his trail.

Hinata protects Naruto.

When Pain's Assault on Konoha begins, Hinata joins her teammates in defending the village. Pain later destroys the village, but Hinata is saved from harm by Katsuyu. Hinata's bodyguard, Kō Hyūga, is not as fortunate, but he refuses Hinata's attempts to find him medical attention. Hinata watches as Naruto fights Pain alone, initially obeying Katsuyu's and Kō's instructions not to interfere. After Naruto is captured by Pain's Deva Path, however, Hinata does not hesitate to come to his defence, forcing the Deva Path away from him. Naruto pleads for her to run away, telling her that she can't defeat Pain. Despite knowing this already, she tells Naruto that she will fight Pain because, after years of watching him and improving herself by following his example, Hinata loves Naruto and will do what she can to protect him.

Hinata starts attacking the Deva Path with her Gentle Step Twin Lion Fists. In the anime, she succeeds in removing some of the black receivers that restrains Naruto and even hitting the Deva Path, but the outcome remains the same: the Deva Path quickly defeats her with Shinra Tensei. The Deva Path then stabs her with another black receiver, leading Naruto to believe Hinata has been killed and thus causing him to enter a version 2 form. Hinata, however, is still alive, and when Team Guy finds her, Neji gets her immediate medical attention. Sakura Haruno heals Hinata's injuries, allowing her to tearfully join in the village's celebration when Naruto returns after defeating Pain.

News reaches Konoha of Sasuke's recent activity with Akatsuki, specifically his attack against Kumogakure-ninja. Hinata and the rest of the Konoha 11 (while Naruto was absent) decide that Sasuke can no longer be allowed to implicate Konoha in his criminal deeds and they resolve to personally kill him. When Naruto returns to Konoha after learning of this and having his own confrontation with Sasuke, he requests that they leave dealing with Sasuke to him.

Hyuga Clan Meeting
Hinata attends the Hyūga clan meeting to discuss upcoming war.

In the anime, Hinata was present at the Hyūga clan meeting convened by her father, Hiashi. After hearing Hiashi declaration that Neji was to lead the clan's forces during the Fourth Shinobi World War, she was quite shocked. After the meeting she overheard Kō contest with her father about his decision, reminding him of how much Hinata had grown and that she was from the main house. Hiashi, however, told him that it wasn't because he lacked faith in Hinata but because she still lacked enough self-confidence to lead the shinobi during war.[52]

Later, Hinata met with Kurenai and was told that several members of the Konoha 11 have encountered Naruto while he traveled to the Land of Lightning. When Hinata was summoned to a meeting with the Fifth Hokage, she was hopeful that she would also get sent on such a mission. After much searching for where exactly the Hokage was, Hinata was disappointed to learn that the Hokage only wanted to discuss Neji's selection to lead the Hyūga during the approaching Fourth Shinobi World War. She was later invited to Yakiniku Q to have dinner with other girls in her age group. The dinner's conversation turned to Naruto, during which Hinata realised that she doesn't need to go on a mission with Naruto to be able to help him.

Hinata and Neji

When the Fourth Shinobi World War begins, Hinata is placed alongside Neji in the Second Division. Their entire division is sent to intercept a large segment of the White Zetsu Army, which Neji and Hinata join forces in attacking after Kitsuchi unearths the Zetsu army. Although the Zetsus suffer heavy casualties, their numbers are too great and the fight becomes one of attrition. After a day of fighting, Neji collapses from exhaustion, at which point Hinata takes responsibility for monitoring the Second Division's perimeter with her Byakugan. Shino encourages her not to over-exert herself, but she assures him that she doesn't mind since she's fighting to keep Naruto safe.

In the anime, Hinata, Kiba, and Shino investigate a possible breach of the Allied Shinobi Forces' perimeter. They discover several White Zetsus within Allied territory, and in the fight to destroy them Hinata is knocked unconscious. One Zetsu impersonates her and successfully pretends to be her for a time using its knowledge of her feelings for Naruto, but Kiba and Shino eventually discover it and, after defeating it, rescue Hinata.[53] On the second day of the war, Hinata helps members of the Second Division escape the area of Neji's fight with the reincarnated Kidōmaru. She later finds Neji unconscious with Kiba and Akamaru. Hinata examines their bodies with her Byakugan and discovers that their chakra flow has completely stopped. She reports this to Inoichi Yamanaka, who is able to use the information to help Naruto save them. Hinata tearfully hugs Neji when he wakes up.[54]

Naruto Protects Hinata
Naruto saves Hinata from disguised White Zetsu.

With all levels of the Allied Shinobi Forces infiltrated by disguised White Zetsus, Hinata and the others are placed on high alert due to periodic surprise attacks by what they thought were their allies. When Naruto reaches the Second Division's location he starts identifying and defeating the disguised Zetsus, including three that attempt to attack Hinata. Although Neji is suspicious that Naruto may also be a White Zetsu, Hinata insists it's the real Naruto, which she can tell by looking in his eyes. Hinata apologises to Naruto for the suspicion he's receiving and regrets that he is still needing to save her when she's the one trying to fight for him. Naruto reassures her that she's strong enough to look after herself; he's merely returning the favour for all the times in the past she's helped him. She silently thanks him as he leaves.

Hinata Shielding Naruto

Hinata and the rest of the Allied Shinobi Forces are sent to assist Naruto in his battle with the Ten-Tails. Recognising how crucial Naruto is to the war's victory, Hinata, Neji, and Hiashi join forces to block attacks directed at him. Neji and Hiashi quickly become preoccupied protecting other Allies from the Ten-Tails too, leaving only Hinata to defend Naruto. The Ten-Tails fires several volleys of wood projectiles at him, which Hinata uses her body to defend him from. Neji in turn uses his body to defend her and is mortally wounded because of it. Watching Hinata crying for him as he dies, Neji observes that Hinata was willing to die for Naruto, which he uses as evidence that Naruto is responsible for more lives than his own. He then dies from his injuries.

Naruto gives Hinata power
Naruto shares Kurama's chakra with Hinata.

Naruto is disheartened by the deaths of Neji and others in the Alliance. When he starts to show signs of giving up, Hinata brings him back senses by reminding him of his vow to not let any of his friends die. Although Neji may be dead, he will live on so long as others continue the fight that he gave his life for. Therefore, Naruto must stay true to the creed he has been using for so long and that she has long since adopted for herself: to not give up. Naruto's resolve is renewed and he thanks her for standing by his side. He then takes her hand and transfers some chakra to her, giving her a version 1-like shroud that protects her and augments her attacks against the Ten-Tails.

As Naruto leads the Alliance's attacks against the Ten-Tails, his arm becomes dislocated. Hinata sets it back in place, allowing him to remove the Ten-Tails from the control of Madara and Obito Uchiha. The extended fighting eventually starts to tire Naruto out, so Hinata rallies a defence around him while Sakura Haruno heals him. She later joins Team 8's attack on the Ten-Tails' clones: she starts performing the Eight Trigrams Sixty-Four Palms on a Ten-Tails mini-clone, but stumbles midway and fears she may not be able to complete it. By thinking of Neji and Naruto, she finds the resolve to follow through to its end and defeats the clone. She then prepares to use her Gentle Step Twin Lion Fists.

When the Ten-Tails suddenly disappears from the battlefield, Sakura asks what Hinata saw with her Byakugan. Hinata explains that she saw the Ten-Tails being absorbed into Obito, meaning he has become its jinchūriki. Because of the abilities this grants Obito, Hinata and most of the rest of the Alliance stand no chance against him and must leave the fighting to others such as Naruto and Sasuke. But Hinata remains alert for opportunities to contribute and pitches in when they emerge, first by joining the rest of the Konoha 11 in hitting Obito with one of Naruto's Rasengan, and then by assisting the rest of the Alliance with pulling the tailed beasts' chakra from Obito's body.

With Obito defeated, Naruto goes off to fight Madara, leaving the Allied Shinobi Forces to fight a final Zetsu. As they struggle against the Zetsu, Kiba senses Naruto's return to their battlefield and Hinata seeks him out with her Byakugan. She becomes horrified as she notices that his heartbeat is slowing and runs to him to provide assistance, but she collapses from exhaustion midway and can only plead Neji to help Naruto. When Madara cast the Infinite Tsukuyomi upon the world, Hinata alongside most people are immobilised by the genjutsu and restrained by the Ten-Tails' roots.

They all return to Konoha to bury the dead from the war, with Team Kurenai and Naruto paying their respects at the mass funeral.

Luffy
---------------------------
Monkey D. Luffy, commonly known as "Straw Hat Luffy" or simply "Straw Hat",[10] is the founder, captain, and strongest combatant of the increasingly infamous and powerful Straw Hat Pirates.[26][27] He fearlessly pursues the legendary treasure of the late Gol D. Roger in order to become the new Pirate King[28] and reach a further, untold dream (currently known to only his crew and closest friends).[29][30] He believes that being the Pirate King means having the most freedom in the world.[31]

Born on Dawn Island, Luffy is the son of Revolutionary leader Monkey D. Dragon[32] and grandson of the Marine hero Monkey D. Garp[33] and as such is a member of the Clan of D. Most of his childhood was shaped by Garp and Curly Dadan,[34] under whose care he befriended and swore brotherhood to the late Portgas D. "Fire Fist" Ace[35] and Sabo.[36] However, he draws his greatest inspiration from the pirate "Red-Haired" Shanks, who (unwittingly) enabled him to eat the Devil Fruit that turned his body into rubber,[37] sacrificed an arm to save his life, and gifted his signature straw hat as a symbol of their vow to reunite someday, after Luffy became a great pirate.[38]

As a pirate, Luffy has actively opposed countless regional, national, and global powers, beginning with several established East Blue pirates and extending to the Marines, the Seven Warlords of the Sea, Cipher Pol, the World Nobles, and even the Four Emperors of the New World. Despite his young age and relatively short career, he has triumphed over a majority of these, successfully invading and indirectly causing the annihilation of Enies Lobby, escaping the impregnable Impel Down, enabling several key developments in the Summit War of Marineford, and defeating three Warlords and an Emperor in direct combat. At the same time, he carries a great penchant for attracting friends and allies; in addition to personally engaging every member of his crew, he has earned regard and gratitude among many nations, fellow pirates, the Revolutionary Army, and even several Marines.

Luffy has gained wide infamy through his accomplishments, heritage, and general recklessness, drawing many large bounties[23][22][21][20][19][18] as well as the focused hostility of the World Government, Marine Headquarters, and Fleet Admiral Sakazuki in particular.[39] Currently, he is recognized as a central member of the Worst Generation,[40] the unwilling leader of the seven-crew Straw Hat Grand Fleet, and—in wake of defeating Kaidou during the Raid on Onigashima—one of the Four Emperors, with a bounty of Beli3,000,000,000.[4] Upon the awakening of the Gomu Gomu no Mi after centuries, Luffy is also heralded by a few as the second coming of Joy Boy.

He is the main protagonist of the One Piece manga and anime series.

Overview
Luffy's most dominant traits are his apparent lack of common sense, his utter fearlessness and unwavering belief in himself.[26] He generally marches at the beat of his own drum, unwilling to approach anything in a delicate or nuanced matter. That said, Luffy has a penchant of being able to see through the heart of the matter, often able to accurately call out someone's personal flaws such as Koby's cowardly nature[27] or Kuro's weakness as a pirate.[28] He is profoundly ambitious, frequently declaring he will become the Pirate King and devoting his entire being into being one.[29]

Luffy's personality can be described as childlike, in the sense that he tends to go to the extremes. He can either be extremely greedy, especially in cases of food, who his crew is, and adventure; or extraordinarily selfless, going so far as to virtually sacrifice himself to avenge or protect his friends, crew, and family. This childish mentality does not prevent him from often getting to the root of the problem and allowing him to figure out the simplest way of solving it.

Shanks has had a profound effect on Luffy's personality, as prior to meeting him, Luffy was arrogant, impatient and extremely prideful. The thought of Shanks being humiliated by Higuma infuriated the young boy, and he recklessly tried to get his revenge. After meeting Shanks and being inspired to become the Pirate King,[29] Luffy eventually grows up to become more like him - opting to become calmer, patient, and avoid letting things get to him.[30] Early on, he would occasionally repeat some of Shanks' lines to other people, like during his first meeting with Usopp. With that said, Luffy is very much his own person and fairly different from Shanks overall. On occasion, he will still lose his cool and get angry, though this aspect of him has lessened considerably since the timeskip.

Above all else, Luffy dislikes weak people, though not strictly in a physical sense. He has openly told Koby that he "hates people like him" due to Koby's frequent use of phrases of "it's impossible" and his cowardly nature. Conversely, he likes people who put in the effort to make something of themselves, despite their limitations, and has come to appreciate Koby after seeing him put his life on the line.[27] He calls out Kuro for complaining about being a pirate, taking less issue with his crimes and more with his desire to escape the life of being a pirate.[28]

Luffy frequently expresses wonder of the simplest things, such as hermit crabs, and can be confused by concepts such as that by digging a hole right next to another he may be unintentionally filling the other hole. In addition, during long and complex explanations of something, he immediately calls it magic.[31] He likes monsters and will ask weird creatures to join his crew (as seen in the Thriller Bark Arc, asking a talking tree to join his crew).[32] He has an appalling lack of knowledge for medicine: when Nami had a high fever, he told her to eat cold food[33] and later tried to make Roronoa Zoro better (after battling Bartholomew Kuma) by pouring sake onto him, because Zoro likes sake.[34] When attempting to think up a plan to get off of Amazon Lily, whilst he managed to make some logical sense of where to look, he is seen to strain himself and noted that he is going to feel sick from too much thinking.[35] He is rarely disturbed by violence and bloodshed, as he has fought his whole life. Even the worst battlefields rarely disturb him, except when it involves a friend or relative, as in the case of Ace. Despite his reckless and energetic disposition, Luffy also has a penchant for silent reactions in general. He is seemingly unfazed by the most horrifying sights, such as pirates dying before him, headless men left after Law's attacks or the extreme violence from various devil fruit users in general.

He almost never gets irritated with normal people, though there are a few exceptions. Luffy gets irritated at people who have different tastes in food as him, and dislikes it when people try to look at his "privates."[36] He also doesn't seem to like it when people play and stretch with his rubber body while he eats but doesn't have much of an issue with it otherwise.[37] On a more serious note, he is actively annoyed at people who tell him things are "impossible" and will even hit people (men or women) who push the issue too far.[38] People who betray their comrades outright disgust him, regardless of how awful said comrades might be.[28] His irritation can extend to his crewmates too, particularly when they whine about the dangers, he tends to put them in, or when they go too far, such as his clash with Usopp.

Luffy calls every mixed-appearance creature he finds by whichever creature is its secondary (non-dominant) part. On Gaimon's island, the dog/chicken was referred to as a "chicken" when it was mostly a dog, the snake/rabbit a "rabbit" even though it was mostly snake, and the pig/lion a "lion" even though it was mostly pig.[39] This becomes a running gag: later when he meets Bananawani, he calls them "bananas with crocodiles attached to them."[40] Also, after seeing Pierre transform, he continued to refer to him as a "horse" instead of a bird.[41] And related to this running gag, when on Long Ring Long Land island, he called every animal by what he thought they resembled, rather than the actual species they were.

Luffy is enthralled by all aspects of pirate life. He was extremely happy when the Straw Hats got their first ship and was ecstatic at the idea of firing cannon balls at rock formations.[42] Luffy likes to sit on the bow of the ship, such as the heads of the Going Merry and the Thousand Sunny, the nose of Rocketman, the head of the right Yuda of the Kuja Pirates' ship or even on top of the front cannon of a captured Marines' ship.[43]

Luffy's interest in women is nuanced: Luffy was aroused when Nami stripped yet remained neutral when Hancock did so. In the former case, it was because he was with Usopp at the time, and Usopp (who is someone he shares a close connection to due to their similar age and interests) was clearly a bad influence on his behavior.[44] In general, he has not yet displayed any romantic inclinations or perversions, having nonchalantly refused to marry Lola[45] and Hancock without a second thought.[46] Luffy also has an indifferent behavior towards marriage. While he knows what marriage is, he does not seem to care about the significance of it, as when Sanji was in an arranged marriage with Pudding, he didn't care if he got married and cared more about him returning to the crew.[47] He also did not object to Absalom trying to marry Nami and only commented on how "brave" he was to want to marry her.[48] Despite his general disinterest, Luffy has earned the affections of many women along his travels (such as Alvida's admiration,[49] the love of Boa Hancock, etc.),[46] quite a few of whom are royalty.[50]

Luffy has shown to admire heroic figures, though he has stated vehemently that he doesn't want to be one, with his primary hang up being that heroes are fundamentally entirely selfless, and Luffy not really identifying that trait. Ironically, many of Luffy's actions are immensely selfless, with his selfishness mainly revolving around his gluttony and his thirst for adventure. This trait leaves everyone he meets with to think he is some kind of hero, but not by his own design. Eventually, he warms up to the idea of being a hero for Fish-Man Island by Jinbe in exchange for receiving lots of meat.[51]

Luffy is an extremely heavy sleeper. During the operation to ruin Sanji and Pudding's wedding ceremony, Jinbe could not wake him up even after smacking him several times and yelling directly into his ears. Only after he was presented meat - his favorite food - did he finally wake up.[52] Back at Water 7, Luffy woke up when his grandfather Garp hit him with his "Fist of Love."[53]

Luffy has gained a reputation of being a very dangerous person because of his recklessness and even insanity. However, unlike other pirates who have a reputation for being psychotic (like the Killer of the Marines Caribou[54] or Bellamy)[55] due to their unjust violence against civilians or authorities, Luffy gained his reputation for helping his friends and innocents in the face of unjust or evil figures, usually going above and beyond to save them. This often puts him at odds with powerful organizations and pirates of incredible influence and power.

When his adoptive older brother, Ace, was killed at Marineford, the mental strain of watching Ace die in his arms caused him to fall into a catatonic state.[56] After waking from this state, Luffy flew into a rage and went on a destructive rampage to vent his grief and anger, in a way that was deeply uncharacteristic of his usual self.[57] Luffy came to the conclusion that he had been too naïve, and was weak and unworthy of becoming Pirate King, falling into a state of depression and self-pity.[58] Some encouragement from Jinbe and Rayleigh gave Luffy some renewed courage to continue pursuing his dream, as well as realize that while he may have lost Ace, he still had his precious crew.[59] After the timeskip, he tells Rayleigh that he will be Pirate King, having regained his confidence to fight for his dream.[60]

Throughout the series, several characters have stated similarities between Luffy and other D. carriers, whether in personality, words, actions, or presence. So far he is thought to be similar to Jaguar D. Saul by Robin;[61] to Monkey D. Garp by Aokiji,[62][63], and by his own crew;[64] to Monkey D. Dragon by Emporio Ivankov;[65] to Gol D. Roger by Smoker,[66] Crocus,[67] Kureha,[68] Gan Fall,[69] Shanks, Rayleigh,[70] Kokoro,[71] Shakuyaku[72] and the non-canonical Raoul;[73] and to Portgas D. Ace by Tama and Yamato.[74][75]

Adventurous Spirit
“	I don't want to hear where the treasure is!!! I don't want to know if the treasure exists or not! I don't know for sure now, but... ...everyone out there is risking their lives for it!!! If Rayleigh tells us anything about it right now, I'll quit being a pirate! I'll never go an adventure that isn't any fun!!!!	”
— Luffy speaks out against learning what the One Piece is from Rayleigh.[76]
Luffy has a profound thirst for adventure, having described it as his main reason for him wanting to become Pirate King. Luffy believes the Pirate King is the person with the most freedom in the world, with the ability to travel anywhere on the ocean.[76] Luffy rejects becoming anyone's ruler or boss, as he wishes to be free to do whatever he wants, though this never comes at the cost of anyone else's freedom. While perfectly content with being the captain, he initially refuses to become the leader of the Straw Hat Grand Fleet, instead wanting the factions to be equals that come to each other's aid whenever they need each other.[77]

Because of this adventurous nature, he tends to avoid taking 'the easy way out' at times, such as when he destroyed the Eternal Pose to Nanimonai Island given to him by Robin (Miss All-Sunday at the time), stating that he did not want an enemy to decide his destination.[78] When Usopp only implied that it may be possible to steal the Road Poneglyphs and get to Laugh Tale without fighting the Four Emperors at all, Luffy showed a look of extreme disappointment as he considered it a coward's way.[79] Luffy almost always takes in the various islands and locations the crew travels to and is always in awe at some of the more incredible sights and locations.

He has absolutely no intention of trying to learn what or where the One Piece actually is until he finds it himself and has outright stated in extremely unnecessary anger he would quit being a pirate if his crew tried to find out directly from Rayleigh, stating that he didn't want to "go on a boring adventure."[76]

Luffy has no actual sense of caution and in fact, has been known to literally laugh in the face of danger and walk into potentially harmful situations with a massive grin as, for example, when the Straw Hats approached the Knock-Up Stream[80] and when they decided to board the Rumbar Pirates ghost ship[81] and also when entering Thriller Bark[82] and while descending to Fish-Man Island,[83] Luffy never says goodbye to those he considers friends, in hopes of seeing them again.

Carefree and Optimism
Luffy approaches situations with a calm and carefree attitude, almost never taking things seriously. In spite of being captain, Luffy does not take his duties very seriously, and is rarely seen being harsh or enforcing standards on his crew.

While Luffy can be serious when it comes to fighting or personal matters when it comes to loyalty and pride, Luffy would generally rather have fun or relax such as enjoying banquets (in fact, he'd rather enjoy banquets during serious situations, such as at Punk Hazard, much to Trafalgar Law's annoyance).[84]

Luffy tends not to take conflicts with others seriously, and this has become even more pronounced in the timeskip, such as when Judge regarded Sanji's emotions as a failure, Luffy simply thanked him for helping them escape much to Judge's frustration.[85] This attitude generally tends to get on his crew's nerves, contrasting their focus on personal and serious matters, mainly with Nami, Usopp, Zoro, and Sanji. However, he has admonished several characters for their bad behavior, and has stated that Usopp is a "real" pirate, unlike Kuro, due to the latter's obsession with denouncing pirates in general.[28]

Luffy is highly optimistic. He always sees the bright side of situations, or anything that goes wrong, and takes matters with a smile and an upbeat nature. He even enjoyed having people join his crew as Luffy was eager to accept Sanji's bride-to-be as part of his crew but only if Sanji returned himself.[47] This attitude also tends to annoy his crew, mainly with Usopp and Zoro, in contrast with their pessimistic and serious attitudes respectively. It's important to note that he is not delusional, however. Despite his unwavering belief that he'll become Pirate King; he tells Koby early on that if he were to fail in achieving his dream that would be fine too. Luffy has stated that as long as he's alive, he has "infinite" chances in achieving whatever goal lies ahead him.[27]

Simple-Mindedness
Luffy is generally simple-minded to a fault. Though he has moments of taking things very seriously, such as during fights or intense interpersonal conflicts, he generally approaches most things in a simple, straightforward manner. His simple-minded approach to life has actually saved him against Hancock's powers because he mistook it for a Noro Noro Beam, which was used by Foxy, which brought out a fear of being slowed down (though it is shown later he is simply immune to her powers, because of his pure heart).[86]

Because of his nature, Luffy does not beat around the bush like most people and will often directly call someone out for their personal failings. This usually proves to be beneficial, as he's inspired many people (friends and foes alike) into becoming better, more honest people by simply coming into contact with them. In fact, throughout the manga, Luffy is noted to have little to no thought-bubbles, which the author confirms, stating that Luffy is someone who always says what's on his mind, with virtually no filter.[87] This aspect actually got him into danger one time, when he carelessly admitted to consuming all the oshiruko right in front of Big Mom, just as "O-lin" was depressed after finding an empty pot of it, causing her to attack him. He realized it too late that he declared it out loud, when he actually meant to think it to himself.[88] Luffy often gets quite serious when anyone is in serious danger, notably his crew, whom he considers his family.

If Luffy finds something he does not understand, even if someone explains in detail, he calls it a "mystery thing"; like calling Dance Powder a "mystery powder."[89] One of Luffy's running gags is asking "non-humans" such as the mermaid, Camie,[90] and the skeleton, Brook if they can poop, in which case the answer is usually a yes.[81]

Another running gag is Luffy's slow reaction time to extreme environments, especially to freezing temperatures.[91] It should go without saying that in an actual fight, his reaction time is quite good.

Luffy's simple attitude and naïve comments during fights are often mistaken by his opponents as poking fun at them. Due to this, many of his opponents lose their cool and charge at him in anger. Luffy also has the tendency to unwittingly poke fun at an opponent's most sensitive trait, like calling Buggy "big nose,"[92] Alvida "the fat lady",[27] Kureha "old hag,"[93] and laughing hysterically at Pica's high-pitched voice.[94] In many cases, his opponents fail to understand whether Luffy is serious or just playing around with them during fights due to his sometimes-unorthodox ways of fighting like drinking too much water in his fight with Crocodile,[95] punching out Arlong's teeth and using it as a weapon to bite him[96] or turning his brain off against Enel.[97] Luffy, however, has maintained that he is always serious during fights. In most cases, once he starts to fight, he maintains a serious attitude and is only seen laughing once he defeats the enemy or is certain the enemy will be defeated, like in Buggy's case when he laughed before sending Buggy flying in the air.[98]

Instincts and Ingenuity
It has been stated more than once that Luffy's instinct and behavior are similar to that of a wild animal's, such as when he knows who he has to fight before he even gets to the battle.[99] Even his fights show this as he relies on his instincts and counterattacks, which complements the way he views the world.

He is most often seen smiling, except in a fight where he is forced to use all his power (and sometimes even then). Under such circumstances, Luffy can sport an extreme expression, to the point where it looks like he's glaring at his opponents, not too dissimilar from Shanks. He is occasionally the only person who can see past events that have taken place and realize the true goal, yet at other times he can fall into the simplest of traps.

Luffy is a genius when it comes to fighting, such as when he figured out how to defeat Crocodile's Devil Fruit power on the verge of death,[95] how to use Soru from sight, developed a number of effective counters to Enel's "Mantra" ability[97] and, most recently, learning everything Silvers Rayleigh had to teach him about Haki in a year and a half (even though Rayleigh mentioned that two years were too short a time to learn about Haki).[100]

In battle, Luffy has shown signs of intelligence, high tactical, and innovative skills. He can easily adapt to hindering situations such as Mr. 3's Candle Lock[101] or Enel's Gloam Paddling into an attack.[102] He also used a mirror to reflect Foxy's Noro Noro Beam attack.[103] During the Marineford Arc, Dracule Mihawk mentions that Luffy seems unusually clear-headed by avoiding Mihawk's attacks. Additionally, during his battle against Mihawk, he uses Buggy as a scapegoat shield to help protect him and move forward towards Ace.[104]

Luffy also has a habit of saying things with a lot more weight and (occasionally) wisdom than he realizes without even thinking or meaning to.

Fearlessness
Buggy Executing Luffy
Luffy, like the rest of D., accepts death with a smile

As a person with the middle initial D., Luffy shares the common trait of not fearing death. He will often state that it is fine if he reaches his goal or dies on the way.[27] He even smiled when he was nearly executed by Buggy in Loguetown, although he did have a look of shock and surprise in his eyes before this happened when Sanji and Zoro tried to rescue him.[66]

Even if he is in a bizarre or frightening place, he will instead smile, be delighted, or even laugh. Luffy is brave enough to face even the most dangerous or frightening people, such as the Seven Warlords of the Sea, the Four Emperors, and even the Marines. He even punched a World Noble, who is known to be in a position that instills fear into others by their mere presence.[105] At Thriller Bark, the encounter with zombies or ghosts did not faze Luffy.[106]

While Luffy is generally bold and fearless, certain events and people can still frighten him, and he can express utter shock as well. When he was a child, he was afraid when Garp would find out about his dreams of sailing as a pirate. He is wary of Nami's temper, believing that whoever wanted to marry her is brave.[48] He was terrified by Kureha chasing him and Sanji with knives and axes, and was shocked when witnessing Chopper's Hito Hito no Mi in action for the first time.[107] He was startled when Monet appeared behind him. On Whole Cake Island, Luffy seemed visibly worried when he, his crew, and allies were trapped on the Whole Cake Chateau with the Big Mom Pirates.[108] Though these moments of fear are usually out of comedic relief.

Leadership
Luffy also shows significant leadership skills, which at other times he usually lacks and therefore has his captain duties done by another crew member. An example of his leadership is usually present at the most serious and direst times, such as in the Water 7 Arc in which a portion of the Straw Hats, some Galley-La foremen, and the Franky Family are present. Luffy brings the three together by pointing out that they now have a common enemy and should form an alliance to take back what the enemy has taken.[109] Another time could be when he takes on the burden of being a captain and does not hold back when dueling Usopp, and restrains himself from calling Usopp back afterward.[110] He also displays this in Dressrosa when Franky voices opposition to Trafalgar Law's plan, getting everyone on the same page by having them assist the Tontatta dwarves in their efforts to overthrow Doflamingo.[111] Crew members also listen to his orders without question when he is serious, all respecting his position.

In the Sabaody Archipelago Arc, Urouge comments on how not just anyone could order Zoro around since Zoro seemed to be so independent and ruthless.[112] Yet he respects Luffy's commands when the time calls for it.

Charisma
“	It's not his powers or techniques. He possesses some quality that makes people want to help him. And on these waters, that is the most formidable power of all!	”
— Dracule Mihawk, commenting on Luffy at the Summit War of Marineford.[113]
Despite all his peculiar traits and habits (with his trademark dimwitted behavior), Luffy's most defining part of his personality is the ability to make allies out of absolutely anyone (including former enemies, villains and even Whitebeard himself), which is said by Mihawk to be the most dangerous ability in the world.[113]

When other individuals heard Luffy mention that he, his crew, and the people they meet are friends or comrades, it touched the hearts of others who were later grateful to Luffy and his crew and support them, like Karoo, Vivi,[114] Nefertari Cobra,[115] and Fukaboshi.[116] That also applies to Nami[117] and Chopper[118] who later joined the Straw Hat Pirates.

Loyalty and Selflessness
“	Tell that idiot Moria... If anything happens to my crew... I'll blast your island until there's nothing left of it!	”
— Luffy's response to a zombie telling him that his crew wouldn't survive.[119]
Luffy is very loyal to his crewmates and other friends and can lose his temper quickly if they are harmed in any way (a trait that he apparently shares with the late Pirate King, Roger).

Luffy is willing to do drastic things to avenge and defend those dear to him, even if it means breaking a promise to his friends, such as striking Bellamy down for attacking Mont Blanc Cricket's crew[120] and punching World Noble Saint Charlos in the face for shooting Hatchan, despite promising not to defy the World Nobles.[105]

Luffy Scolds Black Cat Pirates
In spite of the fact their captain turned on them, Luffy did not want to hear praise from Kuro's once loyal crew.

Luffy believes that all people should be loyal to their friends, and if Luffy sees anyone betraying their own comrades, he would stand up for the victims (even if they are enemies). Notable examples of this are Captain Kuro killing his own crew,[28] Don Krieg attacking Gin,[121] Boa Hancock petrifying her fellow Kuja tribe members,[122] Caesar Clown using his subordinates as mere guinea pigs,[123] Donquixote Doflamingo treating Bellamy cruelly despite the latter's admiration for the former,[124] Charlotte Pudding planning to kill Sanji at the wedding and making him believe she loved him,[125] and Kanjuro betraying him, his crew, and the entire Kouzuki Family before the Raid on Onigashima by revealing himself an enemy spy and abducting Momonosuke.[126] He also wanted to punch Capone Bege for trying to kill Pekoms but put aside this grudge after Jinbe pointed out that they share a common enemy with Big Mom.[127] In fact, on Whole Cake Island, Luffy engaged in a fight against Charlotte Cracker to protect Pound.[128]

Luffy also does not tolerate if anyone accuses his friends of being disloyal to him, as Cracker claimed Sanji would be happy with marrying Pudding and told the "low-class pirate" to "get packing" which Luffy found it highly offensive.[129] Sanji even pointed out during his fight with Vergo that he was the type of person Luffy would hate the most due to the vice admiral's betrayal of G-5 and attacking his subordinates despite their admiration for him.[130]

Luffy's apparent selflessness often inspires others to side with him as a result. Notable examples are Boa Hancock,[131] Jinbe,[56] and Emporio Ivankov,[132] who would not have helped him out otherwise, given their individual beliefs.

He also shows respect for things that a person is willing to die for, be it a treasure or a secret, to the point of even fighting to protect that which the person would throw their lives away over. The most noticeable action of this would be when he protected the Gorgon Sisters' secret by using his own body to cover the mark on Boa Sandersonia's back, even though they were trying to kill him.[133] Despite not knowing the story of Dr. Hiriluk, he did not think twice about throwing himself in front of Wapol's blast in order to defend the integrity of his flag, simply because he knew it meant a lot to Chopper.[134]

Luffy is thus willing to recklessly put his own health and safety at risk to protect those he cares about, even if it means risking death or causing a permanent injury to himself, such as overexerting himself during the Summit War of Marineford to save Ace and begging Emporio Ivankov to use tension hormones on him again as he would rather risk his health and try to save Ace, or Luffy will kill himself if he allows Ace to die.[135] Other examples are Luffy repeatedly attacking Noah with Gear 3 to save Fish-Man Island, despite rapid blood loss from the injury Hody Jones inflicted on him,[136] and Luffy willing to risk losing his arms to break free from his restraints in Big Mom's cell to save Sanji, after learning Sanji's wedding is a set-up and the Charlotte Family intends to kill him (along with his family),[125] though this was prior to Jinbe showing up to free him and Nami.[137]

Whenever Luffy is seriously injured, he always requests that his friends or allies get treated first, even when he is the one who needs it the most. Nami fell ill while the crew was on its way to Arabasta, causing Luffy and Sanji to embark on a journey to get her medical attention once they reached Drum Island. However, Sanji ended up injured as well when they fought the Lapahns, and Luffy was forced to carry them both on his back while he climbed an entire mountain chain in freezing conditions. Upon finally reaching the summit, he immediately requested that they are saved with no regard for his own condition.[138] The greatest example of this is when in Impel Down, after being severely poisoned by Magellan and getting to Level 5 with an injured Bentham and meeting Ivankov and Inazuma, he begged them to save his friend first even though he was truly suffering the most and in the worst condition (he was actually on the verge of death and would have certainly died had Inazuma not found them).[132]

Luffy will also go to great lengths to protect his crew and friends whenever they are in any sort of danger or on the verge of leaving his crew, even if it means putting his life on the line when facing obstacles that ensure ideal threats towards him and his friends. When Robin turned herself over to CP9 to protect her crew, Luffy and his crew traveled to Enies Lobby to get her back and declared war on the World Government. After hearing about Ace's upcoming execution, Luffy ventured into Impel Down to break him out while battling through prison guards, jailer beasts, and Magellan. When Ace was being taken to Marineford, Luffy decided to go there to stop the execution while battling an army of Marine soldiers, three admirals, a few Warlords of the Sea, and even Sengoku, the fleet admiral. When hearing about Sanji's wedding to one of Big Mom's daughters, Luffy, along with Nami, Brook, Chopper, Carrot, and Pedro, traveled to Whole Cake Island to get him back despite the dangers of entering an Emperor's territory. When Reiju revealed to Luffy why Sanji refused to return in spite of knowing Pudding and Big Mom's intentions to assassinate him and his family as he was worried about Zeff and the Baratie chefs, Luffy claimed he would go there to ensure their safety, showing that he is willing to travel back and forth to protect those dear to him or his crew, regardless of how far apart they are.[139]

While Luffy is usually too honest for his own good and has more than once gotten himself into trouble for it, he would never sell out his friends. At age 7, he endured a brutal beating by Porchemy without ever telling him where Ace and Sado hid their treasure, despite the two boys unfriendly attitude towards Luffy. When confronted by Magellan about how he broke into Impel Down, Luffy refused to sell out Hancock, even if he dies for it.

Respect
While he desires to become the Pirate King for freedom instead of power, Luffy does have an interest in pirates and is respectful. This was first shown when Kuro loathed the ways of becoming a pirate, which infuriated him and responded that he does not have what it takes to be a pirate.[28]

Luffy shows pride in his ship and his flag. During the Long Ring Long Land Arc, his crew spotted a ship without a flag, and Luffy was shocked that the ship was "naked."[140] In the Water 7 and Enies Lobby Arcs, when the Going Merry was beyond repair, Luffy wanted to get a new one and had to break the news to Usopp. When he refused, the two got into a fight, which led to Usopp leaving the crew[110] and only being accepted back if Usopp apologized to him, as Zoro stated that he stepped on Luffy's pride.[141] Luffy is strongly attached to the Going Merry, as while he was giving it a Viking funeral, Luffy tearfully apologized on how it fell apart from their lack of care.[142]

Luffy values a flag for what it means, not only for his own but for other flags, such as nations. In the Drum Island Arc, when Wapol shot a cannon at the flag that represents Hiriluk, Luffy defended the flag and told Wapol that he and his men were nothing but frauds since they did not know the true meaning of the flag.[134] Luffy is also aware of what action will be taken upon if a flag is destroyed. When he and his crew were at Enies Lobby to get Robin back, Luffy asked Usopp (while he was Sogeking) to burn the World Government's flag, declaring war on the government.[143]

The one thing that Luffy does not allow is someone or something getting involved in another person's fight. At these times Luffy shows both remarkable restraints during the battles, and rage when something or someone outside the battle is involved, especially if it is a person, he considers a friend. Luffy showed this early in the series when Zoro fought Mihawk, and managed to hold himself (and Johnny and Yosaku) back until Zoro was defeated.[144] Since then he has shown it several times, like when Baroque Works sabotaged the giants' duel on Little Garden;[145] when Crocodile attacked Yuba with a sandstorm in the middle of their fight;[146] when he challenged Aokiji to a 1-on-1 fight;[147] when he fought Rob Lucci and insisted that Franky does not get involved in their battle;[148] when the Boa sisters threatened to break the petrified form of his saviors;[149] and when he was visibly enraged with Hody Jones who attacked some civilians who tried to halt Noah.[150] He even went so far as to cover Sandersonia's back from the citizens of Kuja while it was still burning, even though they were trying to kill him, claiming it has nothing to do with their fight.[133]

Luffy also respects his friends' decision if they choose not to join his crew, even if he asked them more than once, and would prefer not to forcibly take them with him. One example is his declining Zeff's offer to forcibly take Sanji with him, aware of how much the Baratie meant to Sanji, and would only take him if Sanji agreed to do so.[151] One minor exception is the Straw Hats' involvement in using more forcible methods in getting Franky to agree to join only because Iceburg insisted there was no other way due to Franky being too stubborn to listen to reason.[152] This leads to Luffy and most of his crew to help the other members of the Franky Family with their plan, allowing them to succeed in convincing Franky to join the Straw Hats (with some additional help from Iceburg who provided the necessary advice) and seeing the importance to fulfilling his dream.[153] He would also stand up for his friends' decisions, as he defended Lola's choice to run away from an arranged marriage made by Big Mom.[154]

While Luffy prefers to fight his opponents one on one without any interference, he is not above receiving help from others if necessary. On Thriller Bark, he got help from his crew to take down Oars. At the Sabaody Archipelago, he worked together with his crew to take down a Pacifista. At Whole Cake Island, Luffy allowed Nami to assist him in his fight against Cracker. He is also eager to form alliances, as he readily agreed to ally with Law to face Kaidou, though as stated by Usopp, Luffy took "alliances" as a sign of friendship.[155] After hearing about Kaidou's cruelty towards Kouzuki Momonosuke, he formed the Ninja-Pirate-Mink-Samurai Alliance to take down Kaidou and the Beasts Pirates.[156] He also agreed to ally himself with Bege, his crew, and Caesar to take down Big Mom since it would also help with Sanji's goal to save his family from Big Mom's plot.[127]

Luffy also has a sense of appreciation and gratitude, as he saved Nico Robin from the collapsing ruins at Arabasta after she gave him a vial of antidote to Crocodile's poison.[157] When he met with Cavendish, Luffy stated he would defeat Doflamingo as a way to repay Rebecca for buying him food though this changed when remembering Doflamingo's actions on the island and wanting to end it.[111] One of the reasons, Luffy agreed to save Sanji's family was because Vinsmoke Reiju saved him twice, first by sucking the poisons from his body[158] and later helped him evade capture from the Big Mom Pirates at the Whole Cake Chateau.[139] Luffy paid her back by saving her from being killed by Big Mom.[159]

After defeating Charlotte Katakuri, Luffy paid his fallen enemy respect by covering his mouth with an extra hat as he heard of the latter's dislike of insults to his face, despite the latter repeatedly trying to kill him and his friends.[160]

Compassion
Unlike most other pirates, Luffy is immensely kind. Although he desires to become the Pirate King, he is willing to put aside his goal to help others in need.

When Helmeppo threw Rika over the wall of the Marine base at Shells Town due to her trying to feed onigiri to Zoro, Luffy caught her and then later punched Helmeppo after hearing him brag about going back on his promise to release Zoro.[161]

During his fight with Morgan, Luffy viciously punched him for abusing his status as a Marine Captain, saying it was destroying Koby's dream of becoming a Marine.[162]

At Orange Town, Luffy defeated Richie and Mohji for destroying Chouchou's master's pet shop that he failed to protect before giving the dog a bag of dog food, the last one from his master's shop.[163] He later battled Buggy to protect the town he was about to destroy.[164]

On the Island of Rare Animals, Luffy helped Gaimon to get the treasure chests on the hill, only to learn the chests are all empty.[165]

On Gecko Islands, Luffy agreed to help Usopp stop the Black Cat Pirates from destroying the village.[166]

On the Baratie, he decided to fight Krieg in spite of Sanji giving him food.[167]

Luffy defeated Arlong for his cruelty towards Nami and his treatment towards Cocoyasi Village.

After hearing Nefertari Vivi's country being tarnished by Crocodile, Luffy agreed to defeat him.

On Drum Island, Luffy pulled out a buried Lapahn from the snow in spite of them trying to kill him earlier, along with Sanji and Nami.[168]

When the Rain Dinners' basement was flooding, Luffy told Zoro to save Smoker instead of himself despite Smoker being a Marine officer and his previous attempts capture Luffy.[169]

At Jaya, Luffy punched Bellamy for stealing Mont Blanc Cricket's gold.[120]

At Skypiea, Luffy clashed with Enel because of his plan to eradicate the island.[102]

On Thriller Bark, Luffy defeats Gecko Moria to return all the shadows he had stolen, including his own and few from his crew.[170]

At Marineford, Luffy protected Edward Newgate from Crocodile.[171]

At Fish-Man Island, Luffy protected Shirahoshi from Vander Decken IX and stopped Hody Jones from destroying the island.[136]

At Punk Hazard, Luffy agreed with Nami and Chopper to save the kidnapped children[172] and gave Franky permission to help the dwarves with their plans to reveal the dark secret behind Dressrosa.[111]

Luffy revealed to Fujitora that he was being cheated by some of the Donquixote Pirates when they took advantage of his blindness[173]

After learning from Hitetsu and Tsuru how many Wano citizens such as Tama had constantly suffered from hunger due to Orochi and Kaidou's tyranny, Luffy went out of his way to steal provisions from the Beasts Pirates to feed the citizens of Okobore Town while also resolving to restore freedom and prosperity to Wano by personally ending Kaidou's tyranny and dominion over the country.[74] This newfound goal led Luffy to put greater effort into becoming strong enough to defeat Kaidou such as using his prison labor in Udon as well as Queen's execution games as new opportunities for training as well as training nonstop under Hyougoro's supervision after being liberated.[174]

Due to his kindness, Luffy can be extremely forgiving as he still considers Nami[117] and Robin to his friends,[157] even towards people who had hurt him and his crew such as Bon Clay,[132] Hatchan,[175] and Bellamy.[176] He was also willing to forgive Usopp and let him rejoin the crew, though he was reminded by Zoro that he had to earn his way back and when he did, Luffy instantly took him back.[141] He even already forgave Sanji after he brutalized and insulted him, realizing it was all lies and was forced to do it.[177]

Emotional
Like Sanji and Franky, Luffy is not afraid to show his emotions.

When he was a child, he cried when Shanks sacrificed his arm to save him and mourn[29] Sabo's presumed death along with Ace.[178] After his fight with Usopp at Water 7, Luffy shed tears after their duel[110] and cried in joy when Usopp apologetically cried of wanting to join them again.[141] As Luffy and his crew gave the Going Merry a Viking funeral after the invasion of Enies Lobby, Luffy tearfully apologizes for how terrible they had taken care of it.[142] When Bartholomew Kuma separated his crew one by one, Luffy went to tears of losing them all.[179] After Ace's death, Luffy had a mental breakdown and grieved greatly after returning to Amazon Lily, where Luffy went on a rampage[57] before deeming himself too weak and unfit to be the Pirate King.[58] At the Corrida Colosseum, he cried and hugged Sabo after finding out he was still alive.[180] When Pudding told him and his party that Sanji refused to marry her, Luffy was shocked before crying in joy to know that he did want to be with them again.[139]

Luffy is also known to be hot-headed, but he is able to retain self-control and reserve himself. The main examples are with his fights with Bellamy, Crocodile, Enel, Rob Lucci, Charlos, Hody Jones, Caesar Clown, Donquixote Doflamingo, and Charlotte Cracker.

Righteousness
Luffy Punches Charlos
Righteous and fearless by nature, Luffy is not afraid to punish anyone who provoked his wrath such as the tyrannical World Noble Charlos.

Luffy, despite his carefree nature, has a righteous heart and respects the difference between right and wrong. He completely despises cruelty and wickedness and will assault anyone who indulges in such actions, no matter what the consequences may be. However, he tries not to hurt civilians, especially the people he likes, even if they intend to do harm to him, preferring to run from them instead.

When he learned of Arlong's abusive emotional torment towards Nami, he was utterly enraged and wasted no time in destroying the room of maps that Arlong forced Nami to work in for years.[181]

When he witnessed Devil Dias being shot by Saint Shalria, Luffy became mad and attempted to interfere, only for Hachi to hold him back.[182] However, when Hachi himself was sadistically shot twice by Charlos, the World Noble, Luffy's anger reached its peak and was perfectly ready to get the consequences of an Admiral's attack by punching Charlos in the face without any mercy.[105]

On Fish-Man Island, Luffy fought Hody to protect his friends and the people of Fish-Man Island as well as to stop his plan to destroy the island.

At Punk Hazard, when Luffy learned from Momonosuke about Caesar's evil intentions to sacrifice innocent children just to realize his own scientific ambitions for everlasting glory and success in gigantification, Luffy openly expressed immense fury towards Caesar. When he heard from Caesar about how he exploited Punk Hazard and his connections to Doflamingo to perform all sorts of inhumane experiments, Luffy ruthlessly brutalized Caesar with Haki-enhanced punches.[123]

When Doflamingo attempts to massacre the people of Dressrosa with his Birdcage, Luffy refused to leave them to die and was fully prepared to personally take down Doflamingo despite Law's warning of invoking Kaidou's rage.[183] He was not only angry at Doflamingo for trying to destroy Dressrosa but also angry at how he controlled and manipulated the country saying such things "suffocate" him.[184]

Luffy believes that nobody should laugh at a person's death, no matter who the dead person was.[185]

Luffy claimed that Kurozumi Orochi deserved to be chopped up after learning about the shogun feeding the Ebisu Town citizens defective SMILE fruits that robbed them of their ability to express sorrow or grief.[citation needed]

Respect for Food
Luffy Angry at Beasts Pirates for Wasting Food
Like Sanji, Luffy shows great aggression to those who waste food.

Partly due to his gluttony, Luffy deeply understands the pain of hunger like Sanji, and thus absolutely dislikes wasting food, as he even ate food that was spilled onto the floor such as when the food Rebecca bought for him was accidentally dropped onto the floor.[186] Luffy is generous in offering as he stole clean food supplies for the Okobore Town citizens and also for Tama, who had to endure years of starvation from Orochi and Kaidou’s tyrannical monopoly of food.[74] He even freely gave his own meal tickets to Hyougoro.[187] When staging an uprising in Udon, Luffy berated the prisoners for willingly slogging so hard for the Beast Pirates in exchange for meager amount of dango which could never satisfied their hunger.[188] When infiltrating Onigashima during the Fire Festival, Luffy was silently outraged upon seeing the Beast Pirates grunts' excessive and ungrateful wastage of good and clean food which they tyrannically monopolized from the poor citizens of Wano who had constantly suffered from hunger and instantly caused a commotion by attacking them, having forgotten Kin'emon's plan to avoid unnecessary battles before facing Kaidou.[189][190]

Confidence
Luffy is extremely confident in his abilities, willing to challenge anyone in combat as he took on the strongest people he ever faced. When he was fighting Arlong, he was self-assured that he could beat him.[191] During his third battle with Crocodile, Luffy vocally dismissed the latter's position and claims he would defeat him.[192] When faced with a Logia before the timeskip, Luffy would rather run instead of fight, as with Smoker ever since their encounter in Loguetown,[193] but he is willing to fight to protect those dear to him as with his crew or saving Ace. Notably, Luffy faced Enel, who is a Logia user, knowing his rubber body cannot be affected by electricity.[194] Luffy usually charges in at his opponent, something that comes from his simple-mindedness, showing that he can be somewhat overconfident, which eventually leads to underestimating his opponents, as with Crocodile, Rob Lucci, and Gecko Moria. After his defeat against Crocodile in their first fight, Luffy admitted he was not strong enough, yet had water with him for their second fight, showing Luffy can admit his shortcomings and is not overly arrogant.[195] At Sabaody Archipelago, Luffy told his crew to retreat to the ship when they were facing Kizaru, Sentomaru, and another Pacifista.[196] After his two-year training of learning Haki, Luffy becomes more confident in himself, as he is able to face anyone, even a Logia. With his newfound abilities, Luffy would go far to challenge the Four Emperors[155] and even Marine admirals, as he went to fight Fujitora in spite of his position.[197] At Whole Cake Island, Luffy vowed to improve his own Haki by surpassing and defeating Katakuri in spite of having Brûlée as a means to escape.[198] However, he is still prone to being overconfident, as with his first fight with Caesar Clown.[199] This happened again after Queen and a handful of his subordinates took Big Mom away from the Prisoner Mine at Udon, Luffy took the remaining Beasts Pirates there lightly and he was caught off-guard when Babanuki used the prisoners against him.[200]

Luffy also shows confidence in his friends and allies, knowing they can handle themselves even without his help. Luffy can count on his crew to handle the subordinates they are opposing while Luffy handles the strongest fighter. Aside from combat, Luffy also shows faith in his friend's talents, as with Sanji's culinary skills, Nami's navigating, Chopper's medical expertise, Robin's intelligence regarding being an archaeologist and being able to read Poneglyphs, and Franky's carpentry.

While Luffy is fearless, carefree, and self-assured, there at times his confidence and pride were diminished. In fact, Luffy's one and only greatest insecurity lies with his inability of being able to protect the ones closest to him. This happened when he thought Sabo was dead when his boat was blown up by a World Noble.[178] This happened again at Sabaody Archipelago, when Luffy's crew was picked off one-by-one by Kuma and came to tears when he thought he had lost them.[179] Luffy feared that after Sabo's supposed death, Ace would meet the same fate,[178] which happened when Ace sacrificed himself to save him from Akainu.[56] This lead Luffy having a mental breakdown, and after regaining conscious on Amazon Lily when he recalled Ace dying, he went on a rampage throughout the island,[57] it was there when Luffy, unable to save his brother as well as being disregarded as weak from the foes he fought in Marineford, Luffy broke down in tears as he claimed he is too weak and unfit to be Pirate King.[58] It was only there with the encouragement from Jinbe that he reminded him that he still has his crew,[59] that made a resolve to train with Silvers Rayleigh to improve his Haki so he could protect his friends once they are reunited at Sabaody Archipelago.[100]

Running Gags
To complement Luffy's naive and straightforward attitude, there is a running gag through the series where Luffy can identify similarities on things that have little resemblance (like being able to see the resemblance between Sanji and his bounty poster, or being able to see Spoil as an old man with major wounds rather than a zombie),[106] but is unable to see similarities with things with obvious connections (like being unable to tell that Sogeking is Usopp[201] or not seeing through Foxy's pathetic disguises until he was told by the latter).[202] This gag seemed to have remained after the timeskip as he could not identify the Zoro and Sanji impostors[203] until Demaro Black's ruse was revealed.[204] However, he was able to identify Caesar Clown in a poor disguise but had second thoughts when Caesar told him otherwise until Nami informed Luffy that he was correct.[205] He was even able to identify Pekoms when he tried to disguise himself as "Nazoms," which surprised his allies.[206]

Luffy also has a tendency of forgetting people or old enemies he has encountered, which was seen on various occasions. In these instances, he is usually met with annoyance by them especially when he belatedly recalls them in a humiliating moment or with a poor description of them.[207]

Another running gag is his habit of being amazed at various abilities of villains or allies, often yelling out "amazing" with stars in his eyes and around his head. Luffy believes that he is at his "coolest" when he is wearing armor. Luffy also seems to have a slight obsession when it comes to outfitting himself with full-body armors and has a habit of wearing one whenever he gets the chance.[208] But every armor that he manages to find usually ends up destroyed either in a battle or by some other comedic scenario. He also constantly insults his opponents by giving them degrading nicknames (such as calling Gecko Moria a "leek"[209] or Enel "earlobes").[102] Luffy apparently has no skill with insulting people, usually taking either a physical aspect or unique ability and trying to make it degrading (like calling Zoro "three-swords style" when everyone was lamenting Vivi's absence, only to be corrected by Usopp and later calling Zoro "four-swords style).[210]

Another one of his running gags is that during the battles, Luffy often gets into situations (accidentally or intentionally) in which he cannot fight. In such cases, his crewmates fight with other weaker enemies associated with the main antagonist and defeat them. This happened when he gets stuck in a cage in the Orange Town Arc,[211] fell asleep in the Syrup Village Arc,[212] was stuck in the stone and thrown into the water during the Arlong Park Arc,[213] and when he entered a snake's stomach in the Skypiea Arc.[214] When all other enemies are defeated, Luffy fights with the strongest, the one whom only he can defeat.[99]

Luffy Sucks in His Lips
Luffy sucking his lips when Enel's electrical attacks failed to affect him.

Luffy also has absolutely no talent for lying whatsoever and cannot hold a straight face or poker face at all when intimidated to confess the truth.[215] This lack of subtlety sometimes manifests as extreme honesty, and Luffy can be very blunt with people. After meeting Koby and Shirahoshi, he called them cowards and flat out told them that he did not like them because of it (though he later befriended them both).[27][216] In fact, more often than not, Luffy would blurt out, without thinking, what he knows regarding a certain event whenever someone asks something concerning the events that transpired. On Zou, his crewmates beat him up when he casually mentioned the samurai, which the other Straw Hats thought was a taboo topic in light of what the minks had been through after Jack's invasion[217] until they realize their mistake after the samurai appear.[218] In contrast, Luffy has a tendency to suck his lips in and turn his head to the side when an attack or technique fails to affect him, such as Enel's various electrical attacks[194] or Boa Hancock's Mero Mero no Mi.[86]

When talking about money, he tells his crewmates to budget their money, only for them to react in return that it all goes towards feeding him.[219] Another running gag involves Luffy randomly telling someone a secret, such as the identity of his and Ace's fathers, only to casually ask them to keep it a secret afterward.[220] He shares this trait with his grandfather.[207]

Usually when facing a Den Den Mushi calling or when a person tries to ask Luffy who he is, Luffy takes the opportunity to introduce himself saying that he's going to be the King of the Pirates. This has happened numerous times like in the start of the Punk Hazard Arc where Luffy introduced himself to a crying Den Den Mushi[221] and in the Dressrosa Arc where Luffy introduced himself to Cavendish as Luffy and not Lucy.[222] Before this, Luffy also almost said his real identity when signing up to the colosseum only to be corrected by Franky and got his nickname, Lucy.[5]

Gluttony
Like other D.'s so far, he is also an immense glutton despite his skinny appearance: he especially loves meat and can eat a fish whole—bones included[223]—and because of this, a running gag of Luffy is him constantly stealing other peoples' food with his rubber powers, causing them to yell at him and sometimes hit him.[224] It should also be noted that he becomes more gluttonous over the series as there are moments, he becomes morbidly obese, though he loses the weight in some way, usually exercise.[225] After the events of Enies Lobby, Luffy seems to have developed narcolepsy, much like his brother Ace, though for only a short time.[226] Due to his gluttony, Luffy can end up losing control in times of dire hunger. When he expended all the crew's food supply while on the way to Whole Cake Island, he was thinking about using Chopper as an emergency food ration, and in the anime, he tried to devour Chopper alive twice and had to be beaten by Nami.[227]

Mercy
Luffy never kills any of his enemies (no matter how cold-hearted they are); instead, he frequently sends the enemy flying,[98] knocking them out or beating them until they have reached the point that they are almost near death.[102] However, it is evidently clear that Luffy is not against others completing the final act themselves, as seen when Luffy allowed Law to make his attempt to kill Doflamingo, while making sure Trebol did not interfere. This may have been more to do with stopping Doflamingo's Birdcage (which would only deactivate if Doflamingo willed it or was dead or unconscious) from killing him and his crew or allies than actually harboring any desire to see Doflamingo killed.[228] When attacked by Seraphims, Luffy doesn't let Lucci die despite what he did two years ago at Enies Lobby.[229]

Despite his passion for fighting, Luffy also generally refuses to fight someone that he does not personally consider an enemy, preferring to either talk it over or run away from the confrontation.[230]

Over the series, Luffy has become more mature and levelheaded, though he only shows this part of his personality when he and his friends are in dire situations or someone insults him, calling people like him and their beliefs foolish. Other than that, he still acts the same as he was at the start of the series.

Aggression
There were some instances where Luffy seems to enjoy defeating his opponents. During his fight with Mohji (who immediately began to apologize after Luffy took out his pet lion, Richie), Luffy refused to forgive him and mercilessly punched him as hard as he could without any restraint, despite Mohji being much weaker than him.[163] He also refused to allow his enemies to get away with whatever they have done and will want revenge against them no matter what others say. When Wapol appeared at Drum Castle, Luffy immediately showed anger and dropped what he was doing just for the sole purpose of punching Wapol[231] and showed delight when he told Wapol that he was going to defeat him.[232] When Wapol was stuck in the tower of Drum Castle, Luffy ignored all of Wapol's pleas and gladly sent him flying far away from Drum Island.[233]

This attitude extends to anyone affiliated to the enemy. After he, Chopper, and Robin came across Hogback, Luffy learned that he was with Moria and decided to beat him up just for being one of Moria's allies.[234]

He has a habit of holding a grudge, even in dire situations. After the Franky Family robbed and beaten Usopp, Luffy quickly sought payback against them and stormed their hideout.[235] He even calls Franky a "bastard" in the middle of his fight with Rob Lucci, causing Franky to retort that it was not the right time[148] and refusing to let Crocodile help him escape Impel Down (even when there was no alternative).[236]

Luffy will also express hatred and the need to beat up a person if they have done anything to one of his friends in the past and will not rest until he has beaten them.

Luffy enjoys a decent fight and is eager to fight against strong opponents, though he clearly does not hunger for battle like Zoro and Rob Lucci do. Notably, Luffy was interested in Jesus Burgess' challenge in Mock Town.[237]

In combat, Luffy is highly brutal and ruthless, fighting his opponents without mercy. Though, when faced with weaker fighters, Luffy would hold back to avoid seriously injuring them. However, he will show no remorse if they harm his friends and crew in any way. When facing powerful foes, Luffy goes all out that would pulverize them. Luffy would face his opponents rather than avoiding them as he did not agree with Usopp's plan of copying the Poneglyphs without facing Kaidou or Big Mom, stating he would take them down to get to them.[79]

Luffy can be reckless and rebellious towards powerful figures, such as the Marines, the World Government, the Seven Warlords of the Sea, the World Nobles, and even the Four Emperors.

Luffy has a habit of cracking his knuckles when he is ready to fight. Like Zoro and Sanji, Luffy will sometimes grin dangerously during a fight. Luffy grinned when he was attacked by two Beasts Pirates' members on the shores of Wano Country.[238]

While Luffy would prefer fighting his opponents, he has no qualms giving anyone else a chance to finish them off as Luffy allowed Law to try to kill Doflamingo.[228] This happened again in Whole Cake Island, as Luffy agreed to partake in Bege's assassination plot against Big Mom as he only did it to save Sanji's family.[127] However, Luffy will resort to fighting them eventually given the respective opponent survived, as Luffy fought and defeated Doflamingo by himself,[239] and declared to Big Mom that he would defeat her after he defeats Kaidou.[240]

Every time Luffy defeats an enemy, he smiles shortly afterward. There has been only one exception: after his fight with Usopp in Water 7, Luffy did not smile for a whole day.[110]

Prior to the timeskip, Luffy had displayed a side to himself where he occasionally gets into fights with others over needless issues (i.e., he nearly got into one with Blackbeard in Mock Town over a matter of quality of the pies that the tavern served to their patrons).[237] He still has this trait after the timeskip when he is shown to fight with Momonosuke when he arrives on Dressrosa.[173] However, when Luffy is told to keep a low profile or to restrain himself he will resist his urges to pick fights over small matters. There has been only one exception: when Luffy accidentally ran into Demaro Black, he did not want to get involved in the conflict with him and finished it with the least amount of effort, which was evident when he knocked him out and the other Fake Straw Hat Crew with the use of Haoshoku Haki.[241] Although, most likely, he did this to prevent deviations in plans.

Humility
Another dominant trait of Luffy is his humble nature: he does not brag about the powerful foes he's defeated in the past, though he's not above about claiming that no one has ever beaten him in the past (which is not true, having been defeated many times by various opponents during his lifetime). When he was fighting Arlong, Luffy admitted he does not have the skills like his crew does, like being a swordsman, cooking, navigating his own ship, or even telling lies.[242]

He remains humble despite having done outrageous acts like defeating Seven Warlords of the Sea-level pirates and issuing the order to burn down the World Government flag back at Enies Lobby. When Franky pointed out the latter, Luffy only replied that it was nothing to get worked up over (hinting that he only gave the order on a mere whim), for he and his crew were only there to take back a crew member that was taken from them.[143] When Sengoku reprimanded Bartholomew Kuma for not killing the Straw Hats after Gecko Moria's defeat, Garp assured Sengoku that Luffy is not the type of person who would brag about his accomplishments.[243]

During combat, Luffy would not fight someone who could not fight properly. After finding out that Smoker and Tashigi switched bodies due to Law's Ope Ope no Mi abilities during the confrontation at Punk Hazard, Luffy told Smoker that they should fight another day since Luffy will not fight him if Smoker cannot use his full strength.[244] Also, Luffy would even attempt to make a fair fight when engaging against someone who is disabled as Luffy announced all of his attacks during his fight with the blind admiral, Fujitora.[245]

Luffy will also take the blame for something he is not fully or partially responsible. When Charlotte Linlin threatened to destroy Fish-Man Island for not supplying her with the monthly candy tribute, Luffy took the blame of eating all of the candy to spare the island from Big Mom's wrath.[246]

When Katakuri apologized to Luffy for Flampe interfering with their fight, Luffy claimed that fighting dirty is not something to be against in a duel between pirates, and further adds that it was his mistake for not dodging Flampe's darts.[247]

When Kaidou was eventually defeated Luffy asked the new Shogun Kouzuki Momonosuke to keep his name from Wano's public, due not wanted to be treated as a hero. (So, the people came to know him as the warrior called Joy Boy.)[248][249]

At Egghead, Luffy witnessed Atlas being destroyed, and tells Chopper to get her fixed, as Luffy faced Rob Lucci, he mentions that she is a good person as she gave them food, showing his humility filled with kindness.[250]

Stubbornness
Luffy can be very stubborn at times, whether in his desire for adventurous routes, recruiting the desired member into his crew, or upholding a promise. Disregarding how his crew would advise him against taking a more dangerous route for their travels, Luffy would argue nonstop until either they comply, or something makes him see the reason for the alternative.[251]

When he finds an individual, he wishes to recruit, he goes to great lengths to maintain his stance and repeatedly ask them despite being refused (mainly Nami,[252] Sanji,[253] and Franky).[153] Likewise, when certain members leave the crew, he would chase after them and stubbornly refuse to leave despite their demands, cruel words, and even abusive retaliations, having managed to retrieve Nami,[117] Robin,[143] and Sanji[254] when they attempted to depart. He originally wanted to retrieve Usopp right away despite their disagreement, but Zoro's reason made him understand that Usopp must apologize before being re-accepted into the crew. Luffy was nevertheless happy when Usopp finally returned with an apology.[141] However, Luffy does try to understand the said crewmate's reason to leave and help them out before returning.

Luffy upholds his promises quite strongly, even when it results in himself being injured. When he promised Nami that he would not cause trouble in Mock Town, he simply allowed the Bellamy Pirates to beat him and Zoro up.[255] That does not mean that he will not break his promises, as he did only at critical points that would otherwise invade his moral compass, such as avenging an offended friend.

Overview
As one of the Four Emperors, and at the young age of 19, Luffy is one of the four most powerful pirates in the world. He captains the Straw Hat Pirates, holding the greatest authority over a mighty and diverse crew consisting of several infamous members, many of whom are extremely powerful in their own right. Luffy has a tremendous amount of influence over his crewmates, so much so that they all trust him with their lives, despite his reckless behavior and, in some cases, even because of it.

He is also one of twelve pirates who have been dubbed the "Worst Generation", a group of individuals who have become infamous for the bold and major actions they have committed against the World Government, and all have bounties of over Beli100,000,000. Indirectly, he also has claim over the Straw Hat Grand Fleet, a massive fleet consisting of seven powerful New World crews numbering 5640 people in total, who all swore to serve under him of their own will and come to assist him whenever he may need them.[26] The scope of Luffy's authority was considered by the World Government to be close to on par with the Four Emperors, the four most powerful and influential pirates in the world, and the press dubbed Luffy the "Fifth Emperor" as a result.[27]

However, Luffy officially became an Emperor after defeating one of the previous Emperors, Kaidou,[4] and his meteoric rise in status (in over two years) caused panic around the world; he currently holds a bounty of Beli3,000,000,000, which is currently the lowest Emperor bounty and equals the bounties of two of his fellow Worst Generation members—Kid and Law. His bounty is only surpassed by the bounties of the former Emperors Whitebeard, Big Mom, Kaidou, fellow Emperors Shanks, Blackbeard and Buggy, former Warlord Mihawk and the late Pirate King, Gol D. Roger himself.[17]

Luffy is a fierce and formidable combatant who can invent extremely creative fighting techniques even during intense battles and has gone through harsh and rigorous training ever since he was a child. He has been taught by two legendary figures, his grandfather Monkey D. Garp, the "Hero of the Marines",[28] and Silvers Rayleigh, the retired first mate of the Pirate King's crew.[29] Despite acting goofy and eccentric most of the time, Luffy has proven to be a natural born leader.

Luffy has exhibited his threat most notably by invading all three of the World Government's main strongholds in Paradise: he defeated over a thousand Marines on Enies Lobby by himself[30] and took down two CP9 agents—Blueno,[31] and Rob Lucci (the latter being considered the strongest assassin in the entire history of CP9)[32], with the invasion ultimately resulting in the destruction of Enies Lobby via Buster Call;[33] he infiltrated the great prison Impel Down and orchestrated the only mass breakout in its history;[34] he invaded Marine Headquarters during the Summit War of Marineford and greatly aided the Whitebeard Pirates in their ultimately unsuccessful effort to rescue Portgas D. Ace from execution.[35]

One of Luffy's greatest qualities is that he can become massively more powerful in an unthinkably short amount of time. To the amazement of friend and foe alike, Luffy has continuously defeated people who are renowned throughout the seas for their incredible strength and skill. Luffy has also significantly threatened the balance of the Three Great Powers by defeating three members of the Seven Warlords of the Sea—Crocodile,[36] Gecko Moria,[37] Donquixote Doflamingo[38]—and allying with three others, which caused Jinbe to defect from his position[39] and Trafalgar Law to lose his.[40] The World Government also views Luffy to be a grave threat simply because he is the son of Monkey D. Dragon, the leader of the Revolutionary Army.[41]

Luffy Among Legends
Luffy being compared to some of the greatest figures of previous pirate generations.

Despite his ever-growing list of accomplishments in battle, Luffy continues to be frequently underestimated by opponents due to his appearance, age and disposition. These traits have often proved to be an advantage for him, as it gives him leeway toward options opponents would not expect. For example, Crocodile dismissed Luffy as a greenhorn and left him for dead twice, only for Luffy to recover from his defeats and ultimately claim victory in their third match.

Doflamingo attempted to trap Luffy in the Corrida Colosseum, expecting him to fall victim to it, only for Luffy to escape and win over the gladiators there to his side. With constantly improving skill in battle combined with his almost unbreakable willpower, Luffy has found ways to defeat increasingly powerful opponents that have blocked his path, all while having been out at sea for less than a year, not including his two-year training on Rusukaina.[42]

In the New World, he has contended with the Four Emperors' top officers, having defeated two of the Big Mom Pirates' Sweet Commanders: Charlotte Cracker and Charlotte Katakuri, seeking to aim further by taking down the Four Emperors themselves, along with the Marine Admirals. During the Raid on Onigashima, Luffy's recently heightened mastery of advanced Busoshoku Haki, allowed him to harm Kaidou, one of the Four Emperors and known as the world's "Strongest Creature", compare him to a very small number of legendary pirates who actually have the power necessary to face him in combat to the death, such as Rocks D. Xebec, Kouzuki Oden, Shanks, Whitebeard and Roger. During the course of the fight, Luffy evolved his Haki, reaching advanced mastery in Haoshoku, allowing him to fight on equal footing against Kaidou, and finally defeat him by awakening his Devil Fruit after suffering his third defeat against the Emperor.[43] After his arrival to Egghead, he faced Rob Lucci, who had become an elite fighter of CP0 and awakened his Devil Fruit, using his Gear 5 which overwhelmed him. Soon after, he went on to confront the Seraphim S-Hawk and S-Bear alongside Lucci, Kaku and Zoro. Later on, in spite of being relatively weakened from his previous fights, during the Egghead Incident, Luffy was able to fight on par with Admiral Kizaru and leave the Marine Admiral immobile after landing a powerful blow to his head.[44] Later on, after regaining most of his strength, he's able to overpower both Admiral Kizaru and one of the Five Elders, Jaygarcia Saturn at the same time, ultimately forcing the latter's hand to summon his fellow Elders as well.[45][46]

Physical Abilities
“	What happened after I destroyed him in Kuri?!! There are only a scant few capable of fighting me!!! How high will your ceiling go?!!	”
— Kaidou on Luffy's seemingly immeasurable capacity for growth.[47]
Contrary to what his size would suggest, and even without his Devil Fruit powers or Haki, Luffy has exceptional strength, speed, agility, durability, endurance and vitality; ranging from accomplishing feats that would be physically impossible for a normal human to achieve and surviving dangers that most would think impossible to survive.

Strength
His grandfather Garp used harsh and unorthodox training methods to make him grow stronger, such as leaving him alone in the wilderness as a young child, tying him to balloons so he would float away, or throwing him into a bottomless pit,[48] as well as several years of further rigorous training in the extremely harsh environments of Mt. Colubo and Rusukaina.[42] By the time he began his quest to become Pirate King, Luffy had attained incredible physical strength, which he demonstrated by knocking out the Lord of the Coast with a single punch.[49] In Skypiea, he was capable of moving around during his fight against Enel despite having a massive golden ball molded around his hand, and even climbed up a massive beanstalk with it.[50] When caught between two large brick buildings in Water 7, he was eventually able to push them apart to free himself.[51] Even in a severely weakened state after his calamitous battles at Impel Down and Marineford, Luffy was still able to cause massive destruction on Amazon Lily and hurl a boulder several times larger than himself with enough force to destroy a nearby rock formation.[52] Despite these feats, however, his strength still paled in comparison to certain other powerful characters at the time, such as several participants in the Summit War of Marineford.

After training with Rayleigh in Rusukaina for two years, Luffy's strength seemed to have increased dramatically. Initially, he was at the mercy of every animal on the island, but then he became their official boss after several months of training. Other examples are when he effortlessly defeated a Pacifista in a single punch,[53] whereas it took him and his whole crew to defeat two years prior. On Dressrosa, he easily flipped over the massive gladiator Spartan, and used his foot to block a stomp by Donquixote Doflamingo, a man nearly twice his height with immense physical power of his own, without any leverage.[54]

Luffy's Reduced Strength

Luffy has utilized his Gears, transformation techniques made possible by his Devil Fruit powers, to tremendously increase his physical strength and subdue powerful opponents like Blueno, Rob Lucci, and Donquixote Doflamingo. He took out a member of the Marines' Giant Squad with a single Gear 3 punch,[55] and two years later, he defeated the powerful giant Hajrudin with a single Gear 2 punch to the face.[56] On Fish-Man Island, the Sea Kings believed he would have completely destroyed the gigantic ship Noah before it would have landed had they not stopped him.[57] With a single, enhanced Gear 4 punch, Luffy was capable of obliterating an entire town.[38]

When he was imprisoned in Wano Country, he wore Seastone handcuffs that significantly weakened him and prevented him from using his Devil Fruit powers, and he exploited his prison labor as a new training method to get stronger in his weakened state, being able to lift and carry hundreds of blocks several times his size. After much training, he was able to break through the helmet of the vice warden Daifugo and injure him with a simple kick,[58] and later on was capable of physically hurting Kaidou.

Luffy is also capable of becoming physically stronger through psychology. When Jango accidentally hypnotized him to become stronger, Luffy went on a tear through the Black Cat Pirates and ripped the stem and figurehead off their ship.[59] During the Davy Back Fight battle against Foxy, Luffy attempted to increase his fighting prowess by donning an afro.[60]
Speed and Agility
Luffy possesses tremendous speed, agility, and reflexes. While knocked on his back, he was quickly able to escape from a point-blank explosion during his fight with Foxy, jumping onto a nearby mast before he was caught up in the blast. When he fought Blueno and Rob Lucci on Enies Lobby, Luffy was able to keep up with their incredibly fast Soru movements even without using the massive speed boost of his Gear 2 form. When battling Dracule Mihawk during the Summit War of Marineford, he was able to dodge the strikes of the world's greatest swordsman, including ducking under one that completely cleaved through a faraway glacier.[61]

After his two-year training, he has been able to dodge attacks even while using Gear 3.[62] He was able to avoid being attacked by Cavendish in the Corrida Colosseum by dodging the pirate's sword strikes and clasping the sword with his hands.[63] Against Charlotte Katakuri, he showed the ability to dodge a considerable amount of the Sweet Commander's strikes, as well as all of Katakuri's attacks with his trident Mogura (barring one in which Luffy was impaired by Flampe's dart),[64] despite Katakuri being able to foresee his movements.[65] Luffy being able to see into the future with his Kenbunshoku Haki aids his dodging ability considerably, and during his fight with Kaidou on Onigashima, Luffy managed to partially dodge Kaidou's Raimei Hakke attack despite the Emperor being capable of moving at near-blinding speed; earlier, Luffy had been powerless to avoid that strike.[47]

Durability
Luffy has shown the ability to take massive amounts of physical punishment but still remain conscious and able to fight. As a child, Luffy was brutally beaten by Porchemy's spiked gloves to get information out of him, but Luffy took the beating without revealing anything.[66] He was poisoned in Arabasta Kingdom by Crocodile's poison hook but remained conscious long enough to defeat the Warlord.[67] He took multiple blows from Foxy's spiked gloves but did not fall.[68] On Upper Yard, Luffy was directly hit by Wyper's Burn Bazooka, which disintegrated a massive hole in a giant tree, but he only started bleeding as a result.[69] Most notably, during his fight with Charlotte Katakuri in the Mirro-World, Luffy fought for over 9 hours and received significantly more blows than he gave, including being gruesomely pierced in the side by Katakuri's trident Mogura,[64] but he was able to keep standing up until Katakuri went down.[70] During his first encounter with Kaidou, the Emperor's might was so immense that he could knock out Luffy with a single strike of his mace;[71] however, after training in the Prisoner Mine and confronting Kaidou again, Luffy managed to emerge conscious and without serious injury after being partially struck by the same attack.[47] Eventually, he becomes able to take multiple hits from Kaidou without being knocked out.

After surviving being poisoned by Magellan, Luffy developed an immunity to most poisons, causing him to be unaffected when Caesar Clown attacked him with poisonous gases.[72] However, he did later fall victim to poison after consuming the skin of the Armored Stonefish; though the skin normally causes instant death, Luffy's poison resistance merely put him in a coma.[73] Despite that incident, he seems to be quite proud of his immunity. When he witnessed Queen's Excite Bullets, he claimed they would not work on him.[74] However, Chopper needed to treat him later on.[75][76]

Endurance
Luffy possesses immense endurance stemming from his great durability and willpower. As a child, he developed endurance when his grandfather put him through various training methods. When following Ace on a long and dangerous trek from Mt. Colubo to Gray Terminal, as he accompanied Ace and Sabo on their adventures through the wilderness.[77][78] By far his most noteworthy feat was surviving exposure to an incurable amount of poison after fighting Magellan in Impel Down. When brought before Emporio Ivankov, Luffy was given hormones to give him the chance to fight for his life for two and a half days at the cost of his lifespan. He not only successfully fought to stay alive but returned to consciousness in just 20 hours. By doing this, he proved his connection to his father who has a similar will.[79] With the help of Ivankov's Tension Hormones and his willpower, Luffy was able to keep fighting through Impel Down immediately after his near-death experience and continued fighting at Marineford with little rest in between until his body eventually gave out after he failed to save Ace from death.[80]

In Enies Lobby, Luffy pulled off another feat of endurance, as although he quickly pushed his limits by repeatedly using Gear 2 and Gear 3, and was heavily injured by Lucci's Rokuogan attacks, he was able to keep fighting until he had defeated Lucci.[81][82] Luffy also demonstrated his endurance at Whole Cake Island, as he battled Charlotte Cracker for 11 hours without resting, using Gear 4 at least twice.[83] He then proceeded to get heavily beaten by his crewmate Sanji,[84] but when a Big Mom Pirates army arrived soon after to take him down, Luffy fought hard for a considerable period of time, before ultimately being knocked out.[85] After being temporarily frozen in time in a book prison, Luffy singlehandedly made his way out of the Whole Cake Chateau and beat up every enemy he encountered, despite still being extremely weak from fatigue and hunger, the latter of which he refused to address until Sanji returned to him.[86] Another testament to his endurance was that he was stabbed by Charlotte Katakuri's trident in their fight but still got back on his feet to continue the battle. At Udon, Luffy was able to continue fighting while he was infected with Queen's Mummy virus. Even after being knocked out by Kaidou's (who had assumed his Human-Beast Form) Kosanze Ragnaraku, he got back up after a few moments. Later, when struck by the more powerful Warai Jogo Ragnaraku, Luffy although injured, retained consciousness.

Luffy's immense willpower was also seen in Thriller Bark when his body was able to take in 100 shadows without issue, while a normal person could only take in two or three.[87]

Instinct
Gomu Gomu no Stamp
Luffy finding the original enemy on a hunch.

Normally, Luffy can be prone to making bad decisions. However, while fighting, he possesses an uncanny instinct that has often resulted in him performing atypical actions that end up helping him. When confronted by multiple duplicates of Mr. 3 on Little Garden, Luffy was instantly able to find and attack the real one thanks entirely to instinct.[88] When his arm got bitten while fighting Arlong, Luffy slammed the fish-man's head into the ground to dislodge his jaw instead of trying to pull his arm out, which allowed his arm to remain intact.[89] To overcome Enel foreseeing his attacks with Mantra, Luffy used moves such as shutting down his mind and throwing his punches off walls to ricochet them randomly, which ended up being successful.[90] Against Cracker, Luffy taxed the Sweet Commander's power by eating his never-ending biscuit creations.[83]

Luffy has excellent situational awareness during battle. While fighting Mihawk on Marineford, he noticed Buggy nearby and used him as a human shield, allowing him to run away from Mihawk.[61] When he fought Katakuri on the Thousand Sunny in Totto Land, he noticed Charlotte Brûlée watching from the Mirro-World and managed to grab onto her by surprise, allowing him to pull himself and Katakuri into the Mirro-World and prevent Katakuri from threatening his crew.[91]

Champion Luffy

Luffy also possesses tremendous creativity, and frequently comes up with unusual methods to get ahead in a fight. In his first fight with Crocodile, Luffy noticed that he could make his opponent's body tangible with liquid,[92] and before their second fight he consumed large quantities of water to use against the Warlord.[93] He took it a step further in their third and final fight by using his blood as the liquid.[94] When possible, Luffy likes to power himself up with outside objects and often uses things from the enemy against them. He knocked out sets of Arlong's teeth and tried to use them, although was not particularly successful.[89] When Mr. 3 bound his arms and legs with candle-shaped wax bindings, Luffy immediately began using these bindings as powerful blunt weapons to demolish Mr. 3's other wax creations.[95] When he became allies with Mr. 3 in Impel Down, Luffy requested that he be powered up with the wax once again to fight Magellan, and he was successfully able to hit the warden without being poisoned.[96]

Charisma
Luffy possesses a notable ability to recruit allies to his side everywhere he goes, which Dracule Mihawk describes as the most dangerous ability in the world.[61] Luffy is capable of making friends rather quickly, and people typically have to do little for Luffy to consider them as a friend, such as Rebecca, who earned Luffy's friendship by buying him food.[97] Although Luffy does not fancy himself a hero, he will do anything to help his friends, which can earn him the respect of people around him, as seen with the Whitebeard Pirates being impressed with his desire to save Ace on Marineford.[98] Luffy is not afraid to take audacious actions to help himself and his friends, and this fearlessness is another key to gaining allies.

Before Jinbe met Luffy, he initially had no intention of building a relationship with him, only wanting to accompany him through Impel Down and Marineford to appease Ace's wishes. However, after getting to know Luffy, Jinbe quickly developed a deep respect for him, and risked his life to get Luffy out of Marineford safely.[99] Two years later, he would join Luffy's crew.[100] Boa Hancock, who hates all men, took a liking to and soon after fell in love with Luffy after finding out that he had attacked a World Noble.[101] On Dressrosa, once the Corrida Colosseum gladiators were liberated from Doflamingo and Sugar's enslavement, they rallied behind Luffy's crusade against Doflamingo,[102] and Luffy's determination to bring down the Warlord eventually earned him the support of everyone on Dressrosa as they wished to be freed from Doflamingo's tyranny.[103] Luffy curried enough favor in this effort that the allies he made went far beyond Dressrosa; seven of the groups who fought with him pledged to serve him whenever he needs them, forming the massive Straw Hat Grand Fleet; even people like Cavendish and Chinjao who once wished to kill him declared their servitude.[26] When the prisoners inside Udon's Prisoner Mine had doubts about defeating Kaidou even after Raizo and Kikunojo revealed themselves, Luffy managed to win them over.[104]

After his incredible achievements at Marineford, Monkey D. Luffy's fame spread like wildfire throughout the vast seas of the Grand Line. His name became synonymous with power, courage, and a fearless spirit, inspiring countless pirates to join his cause and follow his lead to the point that not everyone had the best intentions when it came to using Luffy's reputation for their own gain. A cunning and deceitful trickster pirate known as Demaro Black saw an opportunity to exploit Luffy's fame by impersonating him and assembling a formidable crew of influential pirates under his command.

Devil Fruit

When he was 7 years old, Luffy unwittingly ate the Gomu Gomu no Mi, a Paramecia-type Devil Fruit, after finding it in a chest owned by the Red Hair Pirates. It gives his body the properties of rubber, allowing him to stretch, bounce, bend, twist, and inflate any part of his body.[105] Initially, Luffy was unable to control his stretching,[106] but was able to master it after ten years of training on Dawn Island, and further master it during the two years he spent training with Silvers Rayleigh on Rusukaina.

During the Wano Country Arc, it was revealed that it is actually a Mythical Zoan-type Devil Fruit, the Hito Hito no Mi, Model: Nika, which allows the user to become an incarnation of Nika, an ever-playful Sun God known for liberating slaves and bringing smiles to people's faces. This grants Luffy's body a rubber physiology and allows him to fight however he pleases, just as long as he can imagine it. According to the Five Elder St. Shepherd Ju Peter, because of the smiles Nika can put on the faces of others, he is known as the "Warrior of Liberation", and that "there is no power more ridiculous in all the world".[107]

He is able to stretch any part of his body; he can stretch his arms to extend the reach of his punches, stretch his legs to extend the reach of his kicks, and stretch his neck to extend the reach of his headbutt. His stretching also allows him to reach faraway places, as he can stretch and grab onto something at that location and pull himself there.[108] He can further enhance his attack power by twisting his body parts around each other and spinning them.[109]

Defensively, Luffy, being made of rubber, is completely immune to lightning. He also cannot be harmed by blunt attacks not imbued with Busoshoku Haki, including punches, blunt weapons, and even being stepped on by gigantic opponents. If struck by blunt projectiles, such as bullets or cannonballs, he can bounce them back toward the place it came from, potentially threatening the one who launched it.[110] He can also easily survive falling from great heights.

He can suck in a large amount of air to inflate his torso like a balloon. His inflated belly greatly enhances his rubbery defense and his ability to bounce things back.[111] It also keeps him from sinking if he falls into the water.

Over the course of his voyage in the Grand Line, he developed techniques he calls Gears to utilize his Devil Fruit to combat stronger opponents, such as speeding up his own blood flow to increase his speed or enlarging his bones and muscles for more powerful strikes. During his training on Rusukaina, he learned how to combine his Haki with his rubber abilities, making his already destructive attacks inconceivably faster and stronger.

In Wano Country, his fruit awakened after his apparent "death" and third loss against Kaidou, granting him immeasurably awesome powers that the World Government itself greatly fears. Among these astonishing abilities are strengthening his rubbery body and granting him even more freedom.[107] In addition to this, Luffy is afforded the enhancements common among Zoan Devil Fruits, including greater strength, speed, and a faster recovery rate.[112] He also displayed the ability to bestow the properties of rubber into the environment around him.

In Road To Laugh Tale Vol. 3, it is revealed that Luffy's true power is not his rubbery physiology, and instead something much different. In truth his power allows him to bring forth whatever he can imagine into reality, however, this is only possible if the Devil Fruit awakens and is limited to Luffy's own imagination.[113]

Gear 2

Gear 2 Techniques Infobox
Luffy activating Gear 2.

Gear 2 was first seen on Enies Lobby. Luffy increases the speed of his blood flow, and thanks to the rubber nature of his blood vessels and organs, his body can withstand the pressure. This allows more oxygen and nutrients to be pumped throughout through his body. Gear 2 greatly increases Luffy's physical capabilities, allowing him to easily surpass the movement speed of Soru users and smash through the defensive power of Tekkai.[114]

Initially, Luffy activated this by pumping blood through his legs to activate the effect across his entire body, but after the timeskip, he has shown to have more control over it and can activate it in any select part of his in his body.[115] Before his two-year training, the usage of Gear 2 depleted his energy quickly and even threatened his lifespan, but in the present day, its effects appear to have been reduced.[116]

By using a combination of Haki and Gear 2, Luffy is able to punch opponents at with such speed and force that it causes his fist to ignite into a shroud of flames, which Luffy calls Red Hawk.[117] By the time of the Raid on Onigashima, his Red Hawk was strong enough that it forced Kaidou, one of the strongest pirates in the world who is renowned for his near-indestructible body, to actually dodge the attack.
Gear 3
Further information: Gomu Gomu no Mi/Gear 3 Techniques
Gear 3
Luffy using Gear 3 to inflate his arm.

Gear 3 was first seen on Enies Lobby. By blowing a massive amount of air into his thumb, Luffy can inflate the bones of a particular part of his body, making it gigantic. These inflated body parts are capable of inflicting damage on a massive scale, being able to destroy steel doors and large buildings with ease,[118] and Gear 3's power became magnified when Luffy learned to use Busoshoku Haki during the timeskip, and Haoshoku Haki infusion during the Wano Country Arc.

Initially, Gear 3 would cause Luffy to shrink to the size of a child after its use, temporarily limiting his fighting capabilities until his body returned to normal.[119] However, this no longer happens after Luffy's two years of training.[120]
Gear 4
Further information: Gomu Gomu no Mi/Gear 4 Techniques
Gear 4 Infobox
Luffy using Gear 4 to inflate his muscular structure.

Gear 4 was created during Luffy's two-year training on Rusukaina and was first seen on Dressrosa. By blowing into his arm, Luffy inflates the muscles in his entire body and covers it with Busoshoku Haki, taking one of three forms. The first form, Boundman, makes his composition akin to a rubber ball, causing him to bounce all the time. Luffy is capable of retracting his arms and legs inside of his body, unleashing blows of devastating power, as well as being able to change the direction of his attacks. His defense also increases, with most attacks bouncing off his body.[121]

The second form, Tankman, makes Luffy much bigger and increases his defensive abilities; although sacrificing speed, it allows him to use his body as a weapon via the recoil from attacks blasting opponents away.[122] The third form, Snakeman, is slimmer and focuses on speed, lacking the defensive capabilities of the other two forms. Luffy is granted a tremendous increase in attack speed, and frequently changes the direction of his attacks to assault his opponents from every direction.[70]

However, in addition to being weakened, he will be unable to use Haki for ten minutes until it recharges.[123] Using Gear 4 multiple times in a short amount of time will take a toll on his body.[124]

Gear 5 (Awakening)

Gear 5 Infobox
Luffy in Gear 5.

Gear 5 was created during the climax of the Raid on Onigashima, as a result of Luffy awakening his Devil Fruit for the first time since the Void Century.[125]

After awakening, Luffy gains increased strength and even greater freedom while demonstrating many new abilities, such as being able to freely manipulate the shape and size of his body; instead of focusing more on hardening himself using Busoshoku Haki, he takes on a more cartoonish fighting style, as well as being able to grant the environment around him the same properties as rubber, which allowed him to deflect a Bolo Breath by bouncing it back at Kaidou, as well as being able to stretch objects he touches like rubber, including living things and even lightning. As pointed out by Kaidou, Luffy's power now has the characteristics of both Paramecia and Zoan.[126]

Haki
Main article: Haki
Luffy is one of the very few people in the world who can use all three types of Haki, and so far, he is one of only two people in the series to be confirmed to be capable of utilizing the advanced application of all three types, the other being Kaidou. Most notably, Silvers Rayleigh, the former first mate and right-hand man of Gol D. Roger, instructed him during the two-year timeskip, and stated he has a noticeable talent for Haki, having mastered the basic applications of all three forms of Haki in only a year and a half.

Even before finding out what Haki was, Blackbeard noted that his Haki had grown stronger by the time of the mass breakout in Impel Down compared to their first meeting on Jaya.[127]

Through fighting against and training with powerful Haki users in the New World, in particular, those related to the Four Emperors, in addition to the Emperors themselves, Luffy strengthened his skill with each form of Haki to a much greater degree and learned how to use their advanced applications.

Haoshoku Haki
Haoshoku Haki Infobox
Luffy uses Haoshoku Haki to knock out a large group of enemies.

Luffy is an immensely skilled user of Haoshoku Haki, a very rare form of Haki whose users are said to have the qualities of a "king". It remained latent within him, until he used it unintentionally multiple times: first, stopping Motobaro, the Rosy Life Riders' bison;[128] at Amazon Lily's arena to stop Sandersonia from killing a petrified Marguerite, as well as knocking out multiple Kuja warriors;[129] on Level 5 of Impel Down, knocking out attacking wolves;[130] and at Marineford, knocking out Galdino and an executioner, along with several elite Marines and New World pirates.[131]

Over the two-year timeskip, Rayleigh taught him about Haoshoku Haki, thus gaining conscious control over it, becoming his expertise concerning Haki.[132] After training with Rayleigh, it became his main expertise,[133] he became capable of using it on his designated targets without affecting anyone else, as seen when he knocked out some of the members of the Fake Straw Hat Crew,[134] without affecting any of the innocent civilians standing nearby. Additionally, on Fish-Man Island, he displayed the ability to knock out 50,000 members of the New Fish-Man Pirates in an instant.[135][136] His exceptional expertise is further proven in Wano Country, even after Kaidou knocked him out, Luffy was still able to use Haoshoku Haki while unconscious, knocking out the small number of Beasts Pirates' members who tried taking him into custody.[137]

Notably, when he fought against fellow Haoshoku Haki users Chinjao, Donquixote Doflamingo, and Charlotte Katakuri, their clashes created a notable effect similar to lightning.[138][139][140]

Luffy Punches Kaidou
Luffy infusing his fist with Haoshoku Haki to dramatically increase his attack power.

During the Raid on Onigashima, while fighting Kaidou, Luffy came to realize that he could "infuse" himself with Haoshoku Haki, doing so on his arms, legs and his body. which dramatically increases his attack power; thus, becoming one of the small "handful" of Haoshoku Haki users known to achieve this advanced application. Using this, combined with his higher grade advanced Busoshoku Haki, he could deal immensely powerful blows against Kaidou, whereas his previous attacks were "too shallow". Much like other users, a sign of this advanced application is the black lightning emanating from his arms, legs and body when infused with this Haki.[141] However, having only discovered it a few moments prior, his control over this application was stated to be "crude" and "clumsy" by Kaidou, leading to him being swiftly knocked down by the Emperor, after managing to briefly clash on equal ground with him.[142]

Not long after, when Luffy and Kaidou clashed for a third time, their imbued Haoshoku Haki attacks resulted in the "heavens being split" in half, causing the clouds to part, something that had previously only ever occurred whenever two of the Four Emperors clashed against each other, or when Roger himself fought against one of them. As such, this might indicate that Luffy's Haki has ascended to the same level as that of the strongest pirates in the world.[143]
Kenbunshoku Haki
Luffy is an extremely skilled user of Kenbunshoku Haki, which he learned during the two-year timeskip. With it, he is capable of sensing the presence, emotion, and intent of others, greatly aiding his ability to dodge attacks, such as bullets.[134] During his two-year training period, Rayleigh noted that Luffy is particularly attuned towards sensing the emotions of living things.[144]

He is highly proficient at using this Haki; he can even predict attacks from beings with little to no emotion, as shown when he dodged the laser of a Pacifista. He also casually dodged Hody Jones' Yabusame, a barrage of thrown water droplets,[145] as well as volleys of thrown weapons from Jean Ango, a master marksman.[146]

Luffy awakens Future Vision
Luffy uses Kenbunshoku Haki to see the future and defend against Katakuri's strikes.

While in Totto Land, he significantly strengthened this Haki by battling Charlotte Katakuri, who had mastered the advanced form of this type of Haki which allows him to see a little bit into the future. After many hours of applying his Kenbunshoku Haki and pushing it to the limit, Luffy finally unlocked the advanced application himself and was able to visualize Katakuri's next moves extremely well, as well as develop his Haki enough to dodge many of Katakuri's attacks and prevent Katakuri from dodging his.[147]

After leaving Totto Land, Luffy has been able to dodge attacks with even greater ease, as shown when he instantly took out a scout of the Beasts Pirates in Wano Country as soon as he began to try to attack him,[148] and afterward dodged multiple strikes from the sumo master Urashima without displaying any effort.[149]

By the time of his imprisonment in the Prisoner Mine in Udon, Luffy further developed his ability to see the future and can now see the short-term future as fluidly as Katakuri can, as shown when he instructed Hyougoro on how to dodge multiple attacks from Alpacaman and Madilloman several seconds before they happened.[150] He later stopped the warden Babanuki's Excite Shot before he could actually launch the attack, stating that he did it because he "saw a terrible future".[151]

Busoshoku Haki
Luffy Breaks Caesar's Face in the Anime
Luffy using Busoshoku Haki to harm a Logia user.

Luffy is an immensely skilled user of Busoshoku Haki, having learned it from Silvers Rayleigh during the two-year timeskip. Since then, he uses it in combat in the New World to increase his offense and defense, in addition to being able to touch and damage Logia users, such as Caesar Clown,[152] and those with features similar to them, like Charlotte Katakuri, a Special Paramecia user.[153]

Busoshoku Haki has been an exceptional benefit to Luffy in the New World, as he is capable of fighting against and damaging much stronger opponents that he could not before. It is most noted as he uses Gear 4, which relies on using Busoshoku Haki, the compressed Haki forms a coating that resembles flames.[121] Though it overuses it, his offense and defenses has enhanced, to the point of being able to damage and defend himself against powerful opponents, such as Doflamingo, Cracker, and Katakuri, whom he could not defeat without using Gear 4.[154][155] However, once overused, Luffy was unable to fight against those same opponents while his Haki was recharging,[123] as noted on Nuts Island, where he could not punch through Perospero's Candy Wall, even with Gear 3.[156]

Luffy's Advanced Busoshoku Haki
Luffy both emitting Busoshoku Haki and using the advanced application Internal Destruction.

While trapped in Udon, Luffy started training to advance his Busoshoku Haki to bypass Kaidou's dragon scales, after recalling Rayleigh deflecting and harming an enormous elephant on Rusukaina without touching it. Amid Hyougoro's instruction into this advanced application, he inadvertently advanced to a much higher-grade application known as Internal destruction, where he channeled the Haki into his target, letting Luffy destroy them from the inside-out. He first achieved this ability in a desperate attempt to save himself and Hyougoro from Queen's Death Collars.[157][158]

After relentless nonstop training under Hyougoro's supervision for a week, while striking thick steel blocks using his hardened arms, he could emit Busoshoku Haki at will, blasting a hole through a tree's opposite side.[159] He later removed Yamato's explosive cuffs by destroying them from the inside out, showing conscious control over internal destruction.[160] During the Battle on Onigashima, he advanced his Busoshoku Haki to the point where he could hurt Kaidou using his hardened Gear 3, whereas he previously could not, even while using Gear 4.[161]

Additionally, his stronger Busoshoku made it so he was able to endure a hit from Kaidou's kanabo while he was in his standard form and Kaidou was in his Human-Beast Form, whereas he was previously defeated by a single strike from the kanabo while he was in his Gear 4 form and Kaidou was in his human form, though Luffy's arms were hurt after blocking the blow.[162]

Although he successfully dealt damage to Kaidou using advanced Busoshoku Haki, Luffy noted that it was only superficial, describing it as "too shallow"; he later learned to supplement it with advanced Haoshoku Haki infusion to make his attacks tremendously more powerful.[163] During his final attack, Luffy's combination of advanced Busoshoku and Haoshoku Haki through the emission technique allowed him to emerge victorious over Kaidou.[164][165]

In the anime, when Luffy uses advanced Busoshoku Haki, it is shown as an orange-colored flowing aura.

Techniques
Busoshoku Koka
Luffy using Busoshoku: Koka on his arms.

Busoshoku: Koka (武装色 硬化, Busō-shoku: Kōka?, literally meaning: "Color of Armaments: Hardening"): Luffy uses Busoshoku Haki to harden his body (or parts of it). It was used for the first time against the Kraken in conjunction with Gear 3 to harden his enlarged arm to the point of it attaining a completely dark and shiny appearance, in order to use his Gomu Gomu no Elephant Gun. In the VIZ manga and Funimation adaptations, it is called Armament; Hardening.[120]
Atama Buso (頭武装, Atama Busō?, literally meaning "Head Armament"): Luffy imbues his forehead with Busoshoku Haki to harden it. This is first used in preparation for a Gomu Gomu no Kane against the Iron Shell Squadron. In the VIZ manga this called Head Armament, while in the Funimation adaptations, it is called Head; Hardening.[166]
Gear 2 Buso (ギア2セカンド武装, Gia Sekando Busō?, literally meaning "Gear 2 Armament"): Luffy imbues his fist with Busoshoku Haki while under the effect of Gear 2 to harden it, which also seems to have the added effect of igniting it. It was first used in preparation for Gomu Gomu no Red Hawk against Hody Jones. In the VIZ manga this is called Gear Two Armament, while in the Funimation adaptations, it is called Second Gear Armament.[167]
Miscellaneous Abilities
Gluttony
Notably, Luffy possesses massive jaw strength and a large appetite. Before being freed from the Buggy Pirates' cage, he made considerable progress in biting through the iron bars,[168] and he also caught and destroyed one of Buggy's daggers with only his mouth.[169] Much later, on Thriller Bark, he was able to actually eat through the metal bars of the cage he was trapped in. He was also able to cause Jinbe, a strong fish-man with high pain tolerance, great pain by biting him.[170] His extreme gluttony also proved useful in battle during Totto Land, as with the help of Nami's rain, he was able to eat Cracker's Biscuit Soldiers to render them unusable, and his stomach was able to handle ingesting these biscuits for 11 hours.[83] He also escaped from being suffocated in a massive pile of Katakuri's mochi by eating through the mochi.[171] Luffy can also rapidly heal from his wounds and exhaustion by eating massive amounts of food,[172][173] and he was able to regrow a missing tooth simply by drinking milk.[174] He can also quickly heal himself by sleeping, and after returning to Water 7, he became able to eat and sleep at the same time.[175]

Random Curry
Luffy's attempt at luxury cooking cost the crew an entire week's ration.

Despite his gluttony, however, Luffy cannot cook. While on the way to Whole Cake Island, he squandered the ship's entire week's worth of rations due to repeated mistakes, and the end result was a huge pot of inedible substance that tasted so horrible that he himself called it disgusting and also led the people on board to badly starve as a result.[176] Nonetheless, due to the intense survival training of his youth, Luffy is capable of roasting meat, and has limited knowledge on edible flora as seen when left alone on Amazon Lily[177] and Rusukaina.[178]

Voice of All Things
It has been implied that Luffy has the ability to hear the Voice of All Things, as the Sea Kings on Fish-Man Island sensed that he had picked up their voices, much like Gol D. Roger once did.[179] Luffy was also one of only two people, along with Kouzuki Momonosuke, to be able to hear the voice of the giant elephant Zunesha, although he was overwhelmed by Zunesha's voice and unable to communicate with him, unlike Momonosuke.[180] Luffy could hear the voice of the ancient robot Emet through this ability while none of the giants around him could hear the robot.[181]

Luck
“	First Impel Down and then Marine Headquarters. That's like an ant diving into a hurricane! Returning alive is something only a god could do. What do the heavens want from that man?!	”
— Gloriosa commenting on how lucky Luffy is to have survived what he did.[182]

Luffy possesses a significant amount of luck. When offered an apple by Doc Q, he managed to pick the lone one that was a dud.[183] During his second fight against Crocodile, he misfired a shot of water into the air, which ended up coming back down on him after he had been dehydrated and saved his life.[184] During Big Mom's Tea Party, Luffy and his comrades were narrowly saved from execution when the Tamatebako, which he and the citizens of Fish-Man Island had sent to Big Mom after being unable to provide her with candy as a result of the fight against the New Fish-Man Pirates, exploded and tipped over the entire Whole Cake Chateau.[185] His gamble on offering Speed Tama's Kibi Dango[186] prove to be a key element in the Ninja-Pirate-Mink-Samurai Alliance's fight against the Beasts Pirates and their allies.[187] Most notably, he survived being executed by Buggy thanks to the execution platform being struck by a lightning bolt, which did not harm Luffy due to his Devil Fruit ability.[188]

Artistic Skill
A running gag is Luffy's utter lack of artistic ability. Before reaching Arlong Park, imagining how a fish-man would look, Luffy drew a fish with tentacle-like paws and an anthropomorphic fish with arms, legs and hair.[189] Before the Straw Hats arrived at Water 7, Luffy drew a childish picture of what he wanted the future shipwright to look like (coincidentally, it resembled Franky).[190] This lack of skill also extends to Jolly Rogers; the first Jolly Roger of the Straw Hat Pirates was a bad drawing designed by Luffy himself[191] (he later used a similarly bad drawn version of his Jolly Roger as a promise marker on the face of Laboon)[192] while also drawing a bad version of Foxy's flag after taking it from him after winning the Davy Back Fight.[193]

Situational Forms
Afro Luffy
Afro Luffy
Afro Luffy.

During the Long Ring Long Land Arc, Luffy had to face Foxy the Silver Fox in the final event, Combat. Beforehand, he got to choose what he would wear for the fight. Usopp, who was with him, spotted a big black afro, and had Luffy wear it. Thus, Afro Luffy (アフロルフィ, Afuro Rufi?) was born.[194]

Usopp claims that the afro gives Luffy extra power. While donning the afro, Luffy also donned boxing shorts, boxing gloves, some type of straps on his feet, and had a temporary tattoo of a flaming skull and crossbones on his chest. While wearing the afro, Luffy also tends to say things such as "Hell yeah!". Although only Nami and possibly Zoro think that it does not help anything, the others say "Because of the afro..." is how he gets more powerful (but they might be joking or just playing along).

Although this form only appears once in the original manga, Afro Luffy returns again in a filler episode. When Foxy tries to get his ship and crew back, he is forced to ask for Luffy's help. When doing so, he hands over the afro he had before, and Luffy uses it to fight.

Nightmare Luffy
Nightmare Luffy
Nightmare Luffy.

Before his fight against Gecko Moria and Oars during the Thriller Bark Arc, the Rolling Pirates helped Luffy become temporarily stronger by infusing him with the power of one hundred shadows that were separated from their owners by Moria's use of the Kage Kage no Mi. This enabled Luffy to become Nightmare Luffy (ナイトメア・ルフィ, Naitomea Rūfi?).[195] With Luffy's strong spirit, he was able to contain one hundred shadows within him when most normal people could only contain two or three. In this form, Luffy was several times bigger than his normal self and his skin turned completely blue.[196] He was roughly the same size as Moria and his body was similar to Chopper's post-timeskip Heavy Point. Luffy also talked differently, losing his usual carefree tone and instead speaking with a grim seriousness.

As Luffy possesses the Gomu Gomu no Mi, he is made of rubber and is thus able to stretch his fists to increase his range and attack momentum. By being further augmented by the 100 shadows, all of his normal techniques are further increased, enough to topple even Oars.

While in this form, Luffy was capable of using the combined strength and skills of the shadows within him. With this strength, Luffy was even capable of stopping a giant Gomu Gomu no Rifle attack delivered by Oars with one hand and delivering massive attacks onto the zombie behemoth.[197] Because one of the shadows belonged to a swordsman, Luffy also gained the ability of fighting with swords, something he never knew before.[198] He also appears to be able to move at an incredible speed, having safely snatched up both Nami and Usopp away from a rampaging Oars and it was only when Luffy made his presence known did Oars and Moria learn about it. In Unlimited Cruise, Nightmare Luffy also demonstrated archery skills and could shoot fireballs from his mouth after drinking sake.

This form however only lasted for ten minutes. After that, all of the shadows within Luffy returned to their original owners.

Weapons
Luffy has rarely used standard weapons, due to his inexperience and inability to use them. During his childhood, he wielded a metal pipe.[199] At Arlong Park, Luffy briefly tried to fight Arlong with swords and briefly attempted to use Arlong's teeth.[200] At Wano Country, he borrowed the cursed sword and Meito, Nidai Kitetsu, though it was mainly used as a prop for his disguise.[201]

Luffy has made use of some nonstandard weapons, though it was mainly due to the situation. On a few occasions, he made use of the hard-as-steel wax created by Galdino's ability as a type of armor.[202][203][204] Enel also once shackled him with a giant golden ball which he effectively used as a weapon.[205][206] Furthermore, in his second battle against Crocodile, Luffy briefly used a barrel of water with a pump to help counter the Warlord's Suna Suna no Mi ability.[207]
Each member of the Straw Hats has gained extreme notoriety because of their association with Luffy and for aiding him in nearly every single one of his exploits. This has resulted in a cumulative bounty of a staggering Beli8,816,001,000, across ten members, ranging from as low as Beli1000 to as high as Beli3,000,000,000.[6][26] This reputation and notoriety have strengthened their bond with their captain as they feel they could not be anywhere else but on their ship alongside him. Luffy does not discriminate against any of them when recruiting or giving them orders and is consistently grateful for the support his friends provide him. Part of Luffy's ability to succeed is him being able to have absolute faith in his crew members' abilities in any situation they find themselves in. This was made most apparent when Luffy fought Rob Lucci and he noted that he could not go and save his crew as he would have to take his eyes off Lucci, who would then quickly kill them all, and so chose to trust his friends to save themselves instead, which earned him the CP9 agent's praise.[27] Following the timeskip, when his crew was concerned about his plan to team up with Trafalgar Law to take on the Emperor, Kaidou, he openly stated that he is not concerned if Law ends up betraying him as he has faith in all his crew members to back him up since they have gotten much stronger, which caused Nami, Usopp, Franky and Chopper to comically blush.[28]

“	What a capable captain... If only a certain idiot could have heard you.	”
— Rob Lucci to Luffy[29]

Compared to other pirate captains, Luffy does not impose any sense of superiority over his crew and treats them as complete equals. He is easily the most laid back out of them all and is dominantly responsible for the fun that his crew has on their journey, being the life of every party, they have, and succeeds in putting a smile on all their faces even through the worst of times. He is comfortable with surrendering his authority when the situation calls for it, something that is dominantly seen with Nami, his navigator, as he allows her to be the voice of authority when it comes to sailing the ship across the seas. Another time was when he allowed Sanji to be the acting captain after he is separated from Nami, Chopper, and Brook by the Big Mom Pirates whilst on Dressrosa.[30] None of his crew members refer to him as ‘captain’ and instead call him by his name, a sign of how close they are. Despite the fact that they can all be frustrated by some of Luffy's reckless decisions, they all share an undying loyalty to him and will follow his orders without question whenever he is serious. Unlike most pirate crews, Luffy's crew seems to be the only one to commit some act of violence towards their captain, mostly in comedic fashion, as a way to vent their frustration with him, Nami being the biggest culprit.

As noted earlier, Luffy does not have a preference when recruiting someone, not on sex, race, age, or even strength. He is somewhat aware of having to recruit people who are capable in specific professions, such as cooking, medicine, and navigation, and has managed to recruit some of the very best in each one. He has pestered most of his crew members to join, such as Zoro,[31] Nami,[32][33] Sanji,[34][35] Chopper,[36] Franky[37] and Brook,[38] with Usopp,[39] and Robin,[40] joining of their own accord. Jinbe is much more mixed on this front as he wanted to join but only after he had concluded some unfinished business.[41] He also has the tendency to recruit people he just met, such as Brook,[42] and again with numerous zombies he found interesting whilst on Thriller Bark.[43] For Luffy, his crew act as a source of inspiration for him. When he had reached his lowest point and fell into a pit of despair after the death of Ace, he was able to recover when Jinbe reminded him of his crew and, realizing he has something to live for, cried out that he wanted to see them all again.[44]

Luffy and His Crew
Luffy and his crew after the timeskip.

Luffy's determination for his crew has been put on full display numerous times. After Nami had betrayed him, he followed her back to her home village and managed to defeat Arlong, the fish-man who had cruelly oppressed her since she was a child, in order to free her from him and have her return to his crew.[45] He carried a sick Nami on his back and an injured Sanji up a 5,000-meter mountain in order to get them medical attention during a blizzard, which was made even more grueling due to rubber's reaction to the cold.[46] When Nico Robin was taken by CP9 to Enies Lobby, he stormed the facility,[47] fighting through thousands of Marines[48] and defeated two members of CP9, including their strongest fighter, Rob Lucci, to get her back.[49][50] After Sanji had been taken by the emperor, Big Mom, he infiltrated her territory, sabotaged the wedding, fought Charlotte Cracker and Charlotte Katakuri for eleven and ten hours respectively,[51][52][53] and remained defiant even as Sanji brutally attacked him just so he could get him to return.[54] He was left completely distraught after he fought Usopp and kicked him out of the crew,[55] feeling great sadness over the loss of his friend,[56] and was overjoyed once he returned.[57] He was extremely angry when he saw Robin and Zoro had been defeated by Enel whilst Nami had been taken captive by him and vowed to defeat the false god.[58] When the Franky Family had assaulted Usopp, Luffy stormed their home along with Zoro, Chopper, and Sanji and defeated them all to avenge their crewmate.[59] After he witnessed Kaidou destroy Oden Castle, where his crew was hiding, he flew into a rage and attacked him.[60]

Straw Hat Crew Reaction To Luffy Dream
The crew's reaction upon hearing Luffy's dream.

Luffy's crew are among the handful of people he told his dream he wanted to achieve after he became the Pirate King; they reactions ranged from baffled to astonishment to the very concept of such an idea.[61] He has the habit of putting his crew in great danger, however, he does not do so out of a disregard for their lives but instead because he has absolute faith in his and their abilities. He burdens himself with the responsibility of protecting every single member of his crew if the situation calls for it and although this has dominantly worked out in his favor it eventually led to him losing every single one of them whilst on Sabaody Archipelago when Bartholomew Kuma used his Devil Fruit abilities to scatter them across the seas.[62] This experience crushed Luffy as he lamented himself for not being able to save a single one of his friends.[62] ​​​​​All of his crew members are aware of the effort he puts in trying to protect them as he always takes on the strongest opponent in every fight, they get involved in. This eventually led to some self-reflection for all of them after they heard that, whilst they were stuck on their respective islands, Luffy had fought in a major war between the Marines and the Whitebeard Pirates to rescue his brother, Ace, that ended with the latter's death.[63][64] Having discovered he lost his brother and received Luffy's message to wait two years, they all independently decided to do everything they could to become stronger and more capable for their captain.[65] Their dedication to Luffy has been a consistent theme of their friendship and was best shown when they all, in unison, bluntly refused Kuma's offer to save their own lives in exchange for their captain's.[66] At varying points, members of the crew, specifically Usopp,[67] Zoro,[68] Brook,[69] Chopper,[70] Sanji,[71] Nami,[72] and Jinbe,[73] have ridiculed anyone who has insulted Luffy's dream and have shown unwavering faith that he will become the Pirate King. On top of this, they all feel a debt of gratitude towards Luffy for being responsible for either reviving or initiating their own respective dreams.

His crew is very much aware of Luffy's idea of an adventure, with some, such as Nami, Usopp, and Chopper, often trying to hide information from their captain that could lead to him making a dangerous decision on their behalf. This was notable when Luffy overheard the details of Nami's new Log Pose and how it points to the most dangerous island, causing Nami and Usopp to panic once they realized Luffy understood what had been said and even threatened to break the compass.[74] This difference over 'adventure' often leads to them bickering about who decides to go where, particularly Luffy and Nami,[74][75] nonetheless, they always look to him for a direction to go and for a decision to be made. Though Luffy has caused conflict due to his unorthodox thinking and rationale, his crew often accept that Luffy can understand what to do in each difficult situation they find themselves in and have come to rely on Luffy's abilities and power to pull them through tough battles, a fact stated by Robin to Bartolomeo.[76]

The straw hat that Luffy dons has become the moniker of their crew and is extremely precious to Luffy, having received it from Shanks when he was just a child,[77] and thus deeply cares for it, remarking that it is his treasure.[78] He becomes greatly upset whenever he loses it,[79] or it has been damaged,[80] with the hat having to be repaired by Nami.[81] He rarely lets anyone else hold on to it aside from Nami, placing it on her head during the Arlong Park,[82] and Skypiea Arcs,[83] and letting her hold onto it during the Drum Island,[84] and Jaya Arcs.[85] It is purported to be a sign of Luffy's absolute trust in whoever he gives it to. The only other member to have worn it is Usopp, briefly, during the Long Ring Long Land Arc.[86] This trend has mostly subsided now that a string has been attached to his hat so that he no longer loses it whilst fighting.

Roronoa Zoro
“	The world's greatest swordsman? That's great! As a member of the Pirate King's crew, any less would make me look bad!	”
— Luffy after Zoro tells him his dream of being the world's greatest swordsman.[87]

Luffy and Zoro Meet Again in Wano
Luffy and Zoro preparing to fight in Wano.

The first crew member to join the Straw Hats, and the second friend Luffy made out at sea, Roronoa Zoro is a former bounty hunter that hunted down pirates. He has become one of Luffy's most reliable crew mates due to his unwavering loyalty to him. Even though the two can sometimes clash they highly respect and admire each other. They are good friends and are easily the deadliest duo among the Straw Hats, and out of all the crew members, Zoro and Luffy share the most apparent ‘brothers in arms’ relationship.

When Zoro met Luffy for the first time in Shells Town he was initially completely against his offer to join his crew, finding the idea laughable due to the nature of his work.[88] However, upon discovering that he would be receiving a dishonorable death at the hands of a corrupt Marine he agreed to Luffy's offer if it meant being saved.[89] Zoro's extreme affinity for honor meant he followed through on his deal with Luffy after he had been saved by him but warned his new captain that he if he got in the way of his dream to become the World’s Strongest Swordsman, he should commit hara kiri. However, Luffy shrugged this off and simply said that the Pirate King should have the World's Strongest Swordsman by his side.[90]

Luffy and Zoro Defeat Miss Valentine and Mr
Luffy and Zoro fighting together in Whisky Peak.

Since then, Zoro has followed Luffy faithfully and has been with him every step of his journey. The two have clashed from time to time, such as on Whiskey Peak when Luffy mistakenly believed that Zoro had slaughtered innocent villagers because they gave him food he did not like.[91] Nonetheless, Zoro has never given Luffy any reason to doubt his loyalty and his actions have shown that he is perhaps the most dedicated to him. He trusts his captain's judgement, despite his simple-mindedness, and followed Nami back to her home village on Luffy's order after she had betrayed them, despite disagreeing with the decision to get her back.[92] He saved Smoker, even though he is a hostile Marine, because Luffy ordered him to do so.[93] He followed Luffy's order when he told him not to fight back whilst they were being assaulted by the Bellamy Pirates on Mock Town.[94] At the risk of his own life, he attempted to cut down Giant Jack when Luffy and Nami requested him, and the others, to do so, which led to him being directly attacked by Enel.[95] Due to his belief that he must follow a captain's order without question he can often be frustrated by Luffy's mellowed personality and lack of initiative when it comes to leadership duties, and at one point threatened to leave if Luffy accepted Usopp back into the crew with open arms so readily.[96] He regularly enforces Luffy's rights as captain and reminds his fellow crewmates that a captain’s words are absolute.

Zoro is one of Luffy's most trusted advisers and often acts as the unofficial first mate as he compensates for what Luffy lacks, particularly a stern approach when reprimanding crew members who fail to maintain their composure. This notably occurred during the Davy Back Fight when he admonished Chopper after he became frantic because he was forced to join the Foxy Pirates.[97] He reminded Luffy, after his fight with Usopp, that a life of a captain is not easy and that if he wavers the crew has no one else they can turn to.[56] He later reminded Luffy that Usopp went against his captain, something that is unforgivable, and believed that accepting his return so easily would tarnish his authority as captain. This advice convinced Luffy not to immediately let Usopp return and instead waited for him to apologize first.[57][96] He also reprimanded Luffy on Punk Hazard after he let his guard down against Caesar Clown, as he felt frustrated that they had just entered the New World and are already struggling.[98] When he arrived on Zou with Luffy and the others and discovered the situation regarding Sanji, he advised Luffy to not be concerned over him as he had gotten himself involved with Big Mom, an Emperor, which complicates their current plans against Kaidou.[99]

Luffy recognizes Zoro as one of the strongest members of his crew and has complete faith in his abilities. He is never overly concerned about Zoro as he is well aware of his incredible sword skills and knows he can take care of himself. When he was told by Mr. 5 that his colleague had captured his swordsman, Luffy was not at all worried and warned him that Zoro would comfortably defeat them.[100] Whilst on his way to Enies Lobby, Luffy casually asked Zoro to cut an oncoming train cart in half, which left the Franky Family stunned, as he knew Zoro was more than capable of such a feat.[101] Whilst making his way towards Donquixote Doflamingo he reassured a concerned Viola that Zoro will be fine taking on Pica by himself.[102] Nonetheless, he still cares for Zoro and was distraught when he believed that Mihawk had killed him and tried to attack the Warlord of the Sea, but was relieved to see he had allowed his swordsman to live.[103] He was upset to see what Enel had done to Zoro, and the others, and swore to take him down.[58] After Zoro was put into a coma, by Bartholomew Kuma, Luffy tried to make him well again by giving him a barrel full of sake knowing it is his favorite drink.[104]

The friendship Luffy shares with Zoro is something he cherishes and was overjoyed when he was reunited with him in Wano, launching himself towards the swordsman and hugging him. Zoro returned the sentiment and greeted Luffy with a big smile.[105] However, Luffy can still frustrate Zoro and is not above trying to pull pranks on him such as when he put his booger in his drink, however, this did not turn out in his favor.[106] Due to Zoro's fierce rivalry with Sanji, he had expressed indifference when he had been taken away by the Big Mom Pirates, however, Luffy teased him when he found Zoro eavesdropping on what happened to Sanji, showing that he secretly does care.[107] Luffy sometimes propels himself at Zoro when he wants to catch up to him, causing them to collide, and has grabbed Zoro when jumping off high places to quickly reach the bottom, something the swordsman does not enjoy. He also unintentionally upset Zoro due to his poor handling of a katana he had borrowed and for throwing the scabbard about, but still chose to tease the swordsman by refusing his request to inspect his sword.[108]

Zoro After Taking Luffy's Pain
Zoro after taking all of Luffy's pain in Thriller Bark.

Zoro shares a similar composed mentality to that of Luffy's as he is rarely shocked or overwhelmed by the dangerous situations, he finds himself in and takes on any challenge in front of him with a smile. He has a blood lust for battle and is thus a valuable and dependable ally to Luffy during fights as he is never fazed by who he is up against. On top of this, his sword skills, physical prowess, and mental fortitude, especially post-timeskip, has made him one of Luffy's most dangerous combatants and has earned him the second highest of Straw Hats with a bounty of Beli1,111,000,000.[109] Zoro tends to take on the second strongest person of any group they face, with Luffy facing the strongest opponent, this has included Cabaji, Hatchan, Mr. 1, Ohm, Kaku, Ryuma, Hyouzou, Pica, and King. He has also fought the strongest opponent on occasions, such as Buggy, Mihawk, Enel, Kuma, Hody Jones, the Admiral Fujitora, and even the Emperor, Kaidou. He has dropped his initial condition of cutting Luffy down if he ever got in the way of his dream, tearfully declaring to his captain, after his defeat to Mihawk, that he will never lose another fight again whilst he is his swordsman, a promise he has somewhat maintained.[110] Whilst on Thriller Bark, he was prepared to give up his own life for Luffy's when given the choice by Kuma, stating that he cannot achieve his own dream if he cannot help Luffy achieve his. This led him to take all of Luffy's pain that he had accumulated from his fight with Gecko Moria, on top of his own, that left him in a coma for three days.[111]

Although he has the habit of reassuring people about Luffy's well-being during fights, often telling them to believe in their captain, he does care for Luffy and will try to protect him if he is in trouble, such as when he rowed all the way to Orange Town after Luffy was captured by a bird[112] and came to his aid when he was subsequently made a prisoner of the Buggy Pirates.[113] He even carried the cage Luffy was locked inside despite being grievously wounded.[114] When Luffy was about to be executed by Buggy in Loguetown, Zoro, alongside Sanji, desperately tried to reach the platform he was on in order to free him.[115] Whilst on Jaya, he held Bellamy at the edge of his sword after he attacked Luffy before warning him to think about his next step.[116] He also managed to slice Kuma, whilst on Thriller Bark, when the Warlord tried to take Luffy away.[117] He tried to leave Kuraigana Island after discovering that Luffy had fought in the Summit War of Marineford and lost his brother, Ace, right in front of him, as he worried for his captain’s well-being.[64] After receiving Luffy's message to wait two years, he decided to forget his pride and begged Mihawk to train him in order to become stronger for Luffy's sake.[118] Zoro implied during the Long Ring Long Land Arc that Luffy is the sole reason for him being a pirate and stated he'd have no reason to continue being one if he could not have him as his captain.[119]

Zoro thinks highly of Luffy and greatly admires him for his unwavering determination, complete lack of fear, incredible fighting abilities, and even, at times, his craziness. He was impressed when he took a blade to the back of the head from Jango only to pull it out and remain mostly unfazed.[120] When on Thriller Bark, he emphatically stated to Kuma that Luffy would become the Pirate King.[68] On Dressrosa, he intercepted Pica's attempts to attack Luffy multiple times and told him that he is not worthy to face his captain.[121][122] He was pleased to see Luffy was able to use Haoshoku Haki on Fish-Man Island to knock out 50,000 of Hody Jones' crew, jokingly remarking that if he was not capable of doing that much he was not worthy of being his captain.[123] He has shown to have complete faith in his captain such as when, after Luffy stayed behind to fight Crocodile, he ordered Chopper to keep the crab they were riding on moving and reassured a worried Vivi that Luffy will be fine.[124]

Nami
“	Nami...!! You're one of us now, okay?!!	”
— Luffy after defeating Arlong.[125]
Luffy Places His Straw Hat on Nami's Head
Luffy puts his "treasure" on Nami's head before going to fight Arlong.

Nami, who was originally part of the Arlong Pirates, is the second person to join Luffy's crew. She and Luffy share one of the closest relationships among the Straw Hats and have a mutual reliance on each other, with Luffy relying on Nami as his navigator and for day-to-day tasks whilst Nami relies on Luffy as a pillar of strength during dangerous and frantic times. The two are often seen arguing due to Nami getting frustrated by Luffy's antics and stupidity and Luffy being annoyed at Nami for being overbearing and ruining his fun.

Luffy is dominantly responsible for changing Nami's views on pirates. Due to her experience with Arlong she held a strong hatred for pirates and Luffy was no exception, and at one point she tried to attack him after seeing the devastation that had been done to Orange Town.[126] However, after seeing his interaction with the dog, Chouchou,[127] working alongside him to defeat Buggy,[128] and realizing he is not as bad as she originally thought, she decided to cooperate with him as a means to an end,[33][129][130] but eventually joined his crew after getting closer to him and seeing his kindheartedness firsthand. However, Nami betrayed Luffy and the crew during the Baratie Arc, stealing their ship with all their treasure on board, and returned to Arlong.[131] She did so with tears in her eyes as she wondered if she would ever meet them again and hoped Luffy and the others would still consider her their friend.[132] Following his victory over Don Krieg,[133] Luffy traveled to Nami's village and freed her and her village from Arlong's rule.[134] Since then, she has been a mainstay of the crew and has developed a fierce loyalty to Luffy, feeling indebted to him for everything he has done for her.

Nami acts as one of Luffy's negotiators and counsels him numerous times throughout their journey. When the crew first met Princess Vivi, in Luffy's absence, Nami negotiated the agreement with Igaram to return her to Arabasta, thereby instigating the entire Arabasta Saga.[135] On Water 7, she also negotiated the money that Luffy and their crew earned from the treasure they had stolen from Skypiea that eventually allowed them to pay for a new ship.[136] Luffy often listens to Nami's requests, such as on Punk Hazard where he forced Law to help him save the children there because Nami, as well as Chopper, wanted to do so.[137] Nami is also the only crew member, besides Luffy, to have invited somebody else to join the crew, doing so back on Drum Island to Chopper.[138]

Nami Tries to Wake Luffy Up

Very often, Nami tends to be the one to make sure Luffy does not do anything too reckless, having to explain to Luffy why he cannot do some of the crazy things he wants to do and frequently berates him for his careless actions, big or small. This has been seen when she stopped Luffy fighting with Zoro on Whisky Peak,[139] and when the crew landed in Mock Town, Nami made him promise her not to fight anyone.[140] When talking with Haredas, she says that it is her responsibility to deal with Luffy's reckless nature and to make sure he does not die when traversing the seas. Although admitting that he is high maintenance, she tells Haredas that she wants to help him as much as possible after she reflects on what he has done for her and acknowledges that she owes him so much.[141] Since the time skip, Nami has become less strict with Luffy, whereas before she would try and keep Luffy under control to avoid him causing chaos, which normally ended in failure, she now accepts whatever chaos Luffy brings with him. This change notably started on Sabaody Archipelago, when she just accepted that her captain had punched a Celestial Dragon and brushed it off despite the severe repercussions.[142]

Nami Hugs Luffy

To Nami, Luffy is the person she can turn to and rely on when emotionally distressed or feeling frightened. This was first seen on Syrup Village where she was relieved to see he was ready to fight after she had managed to wake him up.[143] When she broke down after Arlong denied her the chance to free herself, and her village, from him, she turned to Luffy in tears and asked for his help.[144] This moment showed Nami's great trust in Luffy, as up to this point she had refused to ever ask for help from anyone. When she fell sick with a mysterious illness, she sided with Luffy when he wished to carry her to the doctor who lives on top of the mountain on Drum Island and openly stated her complete faith in him getting her there safely, despite the extreme risks.[145] She was overjoyed when Luffy had come to save her after Enel had taken her to his ship.[146] When she was kidnapped by the Yeti Cool Brothers she scolded them and warned them that Luffy would come and save her.[147] When Luffy arrived on Zou she immediately ran up, tearfully hugged him, and apologized for allowing Sanji to be taken away by the Big Mom Pirates.[148]

Like all the other members of the Straw Hats, she has complete faith in Luffy's abilities. She rarely doubts him in a fight and is often left amazed and inspired by his feats, strength, and determination. Luffy's victories over enemies, especially in the case of Arlong and his declaration that she is his friend, which caused her to cry tears of joy,[149] has given her unwavering belief in her captain and she revealed as much when Vivi worried for Luffy after he went to fight Crocodile on his own.[150] When he defeated Big Mom's Sweet Commander, Charlotte Cracker, she was left amazed and soon overjoyed at their victory.[151][152] And when Luffy defeated an even stronger Sweet Commander, Charlotte Katakuri, she was both relieved that he was safe and stunned at his victory.[153] On Water 7 she was left utterly astonished by Luffy's lineage when she found out the Marine hero, Monkey D. Garp, is his grandfather[154][155] and was even more shocked when she was told his father is the Revolutionary Army's leader, Monkey D. Dragon, commenting that he is an outrageous man.[156]

Despite her faith in him she is regularly concerned for Luffy and tries to look out for him. This has been seen during Luffy's numerous battles, including Arlong, Enel,[157] Hody Jones,[158] Sanji, Big Mom's army,[159] and Katakuri. In the case of Sanji, she was much more distressed and angrier at the beating Luffy was getting, as he refused to fight back, and furiously slapped Sanji in retaliation.[54] She has also shown to worry for him outside of battle, this was seen when she caught him after he had defeated Kuro[160] and he caused her distress by trying to rip off his own arms in order to escape the prison, they were trapped in.[161] Notably, when faced with Kaidou's declaration that he had killed Luffy, Nami started to cry and called the emperor a liar. When she fell to the floor following Kaidou's attack towards her she weeps Luffy's name.[162] Nami is also aware of how close Luffy is to his brother, Portgas D. Ace, and showed her concern when, after leaving Thriller Bark, she goes to Luffy and asks how he is doing after being informed about the state of Ace's Vivre Card, but smiles when he reassures her.[163] When she read that Luffy witnessed Ace get killed before his very eyes she became distraught and tried to escape Weatheria whilst telling herself she needs to get to him before his heart completely shatters as she knows full well what he is going through. When Haredas pointed out her "fake tears" were still flowing she became embarrassed and punched him.[64]

Luffy has absolute loyalty and faith in Nami and has never doubted her. Even when she betrayed him Luffy's opinion of her did not waver and he remained determined to have her in his crew, in spite of Zoro and Usopp's protests, flat out stating to them that he would not accept anyone else as his navigator.[92] He was greatly angered when Johnny mistakenly believed that Nami had killed Usopp and called him a liar and threatened to "kick his ass" for saying such things.[164] This differs greatly when he believed the accusation that Zoro had slaughtered the people of Whisky Peak in cold blood despite the source being unreliable.[165][166] Luffy was determined to have Nami back in his crew and completely disregarded her request to leave her village, despite angering her,[167] and chose not to listen to Nojiko tell the story of Nami's past as nothing she could tell him would change his mind.[168] Even though Nami has no talent for fighting he does not hesitate to have her by his side in battle, such as when they worked together to defeat Buggy[128] and again to defeat the Sweet Commander, Cracker.[169] He never tries to stop her fighting tough opponents, as he trusts her to win, and has no qualms when she goes off to complete tasks she has been assigned regardless of the danger. However, they can differ when deciding what routes to take, as Nami prioritizes safety and Luffy desires danger as its more fun and adventurous. He has complete trust in her intuition and knowledge as a navigator and never questions her. When Inuarashi praised her navigation skills, Luffy chimed into state how amazing she is and patted her on the back but, typically, annoyed her by how hard he was hitting, although she was briefly thankful for the compliment.[170] He also trusts her enough to let her be in charge of the finances of the crew.[171]

Frequently, Luffy showed that he truly cared for her well-being. It was showcased in Arlong Park, when he angrily told Arlong, after punching him, not to make his navigator cry after the fish-man had upset her.[172] Later, Luffy became furious when he deduced that Arlong had imprisoned Nami in a room throughout her childhood to draw maps for him[173] and told the fish-man that he knew how to save her as he proceeded to destroy the entire room. This act caused Nami to tear up and thank Luffy as he was freeing her from the mental and physical prison, she was trapped in.[174] When Nami fell sick with a mysterious illness Luffy became worried and sought to get her to a doctor immediately[175] and carried her up a 5,000-meter-high mountain, whilst barehanded and in a blizzard, to do so.[46] Luffy's care for Nami is such that, despite his steadfast refusal to ever share his meat,[176] he made an exception for her when he saw she was upset as they left Arabasta.[177] When Nami came to him in tears and told him the real reason why Robin left them, he reassured and promised her that he would not let Robin die.[178] Notably, Luffy and other members of the crew holds a grudge on Nami's behalf for all the suffering she went through as he initially refused to save Hatchan because he was a former member of the Arlong Pirates,[179] however, he agreed to save him after Nami wished for him to do so.[180]

Throughout their adventures Nami has been one of the persons Luffy has given his straw hat to, either to wear as a source of comfort before he fights or to look after it. The first time she held it was on Syrup Village after Luffy had beaten Kuro.[160] Whilst on Cocoyasi Village Luffy placed his straw hat on her head right before his fight with Arlong as a sign of his promise that he will defeat him for her. Nami remembered Luffy saying his hat is his only treasure and teared up at the gesture[82] and later placed it back on his head after he had won.[181] He gave Nami his hat again, before he continued his fight with Enel, to reassure her after she began to panic.[83] This act has mostly subsided now that Luffy has a string attached to his hat that stops him from losing it during a fight and Nami has become more active in battles.

Realizing her own shortcomings, and wishing to be more helpful for Luffy, Nami turned to Usopp to help make her a device so she can be more capable in fights, feeling guilty that Luffy and the others constantly have to save her.[182] When she received Luffy's message to wait two years she was notably the only one frustrated by this decision[183] but decided to spend her time to get stronger and become a more capable navigator for Luffy's sake, believing she owed him so much for all he has done for her.[141] The two have rarely fought side by side but did so against Buggy when they first met[128] and again when they fought Cracker,[169] where she proved to be crucial to Luffy's victory both times. She also stayed by Luffy's side to fight against Big Mom's army when he refused to hide, which ended with them both being captured.[184] When she found out Luffy was going to save Sanji she insisted on going with him because she knew his group could not get there safely without her and felt responsible for getting Sanji back.[185] During her fight with Cracker, she remained defiant towards him, telling him that he might be the right-hand man of an Emperor but her captain will become the Pirate King.[186] Nami tearfully reiterated her belief in Luffy becoming the Pirate King during the Raid on Onigashima despite the threat of certain death from another attack by Ulti and being given the option to live if she stated he would never become Pirate King.[187]

Despite this she still has arguments with him, which has become a staple of their friendship and are usually started by Nami herself. They also have a running gag, which is Nami's tendency to habitually overcharge Luffy for various reasons, such as after she lent her jacket to him during the Drum Island Arc, she charged him a heavy sum for ruining it.[188] However, she has since toned down this habit as it once inadvertently led to Luffy destroying their food supplies when he tried to cook in Sanji's absence because she would not cook for free.[189]

Usopp
Luffy and Usopp Together
Luffy and Usopp together.

Usopp, the former captain of the ‘Usopp Pirates’, became the third member to join Luffy's crew. The two share a close bond of brotherly love and act like best friends. Whilst Usopp is cowardly and weak Luffy does not disparage him for it in the slightest and values him as a crew member, being distraught when he was forced to kick Usopp out and overjoyed when he had returned. They are seen engaging in silly antics on the ship and the two are notorious for being the idiots of the crew. Like Nami and Chopper, Usopp greatly fears Luffy's lust for dangerous adventures.

Luffy had first heard of Usopp when he was child as he met his father, Yasopp, who would talk about him.[190] They first met on Syrup Village when Usopp, being a habitual liar, tried to intimidate Luffy, Zoro, and Nami with his exaggerated crew size.[191] Later, during Usopp’s confrontation with Kuro, Luffy remembered that he had met Usopp’s father, who is an officer and sniper of the Red Hair Pirates, back on his home village. He informed Usopp of this and the two quickly bonded.[192] After Luffy's victory over Kuro,[193] who plotted to kill his friend, Kaya,[194] Usopp became inspired to go out to sea and start his own pirate journey.[195] Initially believing they would not want him to join, he became overjoyed when he was invited aboard the Straw Hats’ ship to sail with them, becoming their newest member.[39]

Since then, he has been a faithful member of Luffy's crew and does his best to contribute wherever he can. He was initially responsible for patching up the ship before the crew recruited Franky[196] and is also a gadgets expert who invents various equipment and weapons to become more useful to Luffy in fights, particularly with Dials.[197] When testing the cannon on the Going Merry, he greatly impressed Luffy with his accuracy and was made the gunner of the Straw Hats. He was also responsible for designing the official flag of the Straw Hat Pirates after Luffy proved to not have a talent for art.[198] Usopp has aided Luffy in battle, as well, such as when he tried to help him when he was at Mr. 5's mercy[199] and later was responsible for breaking Luffy free of Miss Goldenweek's Color Traps.[200] Whilst on Skypiea, he launched a barrage of attacks on Giant Jack so it would fall westwards after Luffy, through Nami, asked him and the others to do so, despite having seen Zoro get struck down by Enel earlier for attempting the same thing.[201] Despite being weak, he proved to be the only person capable of defeating Perona on Thriller Bark,[202] who had effortlessly subdued Luffy himself,[203] as well as Zoro, Sanji and Franky.[204] He has also taken down a slew of difficult enemies, including Jango,[205] Chew,[206] Mr. 4 and Miss Merry Christmas,[207] Perona,[208] Daruma,[209] and Sugar.[210]

Usopp holds great admiration for Luffy and often lies about himself in the mold of him, falsely claiming credit for some of his achievements. Luffy has made such a profound impact on him that he has mostly shed his cowardly personality, although some of it still remains, having become more comfortable and adept at fighting and adventuring. This change first started whilst on Cocoyasi Village, when, despite normally trying to discourage going into any kind of danger, he chose to walk by Luffy's side when he stormed Arlong Park for Nami.[82] Whilst on Water 7, he felt extreme guilt after he was assaulted and robbed by members of the Franky Family, losing a large portion of the crew's money, and tearfully told Nami he could not face Luffy and the others as a result.[211] Although they are close, Usopp is capable of irritating Luffy, such as when he proclaims himself to be the captain or when he once tried to redesign the crew's jolly roger to resemble him which prompted both Luffy and Zoro to hit him.[198] When he tried to recruit Chopper, Luffy chastised Usopp after he scared him off by calling him a "monster".[212] Although rare, he has even managed to anger Luffy, such as when he asked the former first mate of the Roger Pirates, Silvers Rayleigh, for the location of the One Piece. This resulted in Luffy delivering an impassioned speech to him about the importance of adventure and convinced him that it is better not to know at all.[213]

Usopp Angry With Luffy
Usopp getting angry with Luffy for his decision regarding the Going Merry.

The two reached a breaking point over the decision regarding the Going Merry. Usopp cherished the ship as it embodied his friendship with Kaya and took great pride in his responsibility to repair the Merry, the only thing he felt he was truly useful for. He also was absent when Luffy heard the news about the condition of the ship for the first time, and therefore didn't get to hear Luffy's initial objection nor Luffy's anguish at the thought of leaving the ship behind. Thus, when Luffy told him the news later. he was extremely angry that Luffy was so casually willing to abandon it. The fact Usopp was the only Straw Hat to have seen the spirit of the ship before and therefore knew that the ship was "alive" also contributed to his feelings of betrayal. In his anger, he quit the crew and challenged Luffy to a duel for the Going Merry but lost the fight despite putting on a good show.[55][214][215] Luffy himself was left in tears about having to fight his best-friend and despised every moment of it.[56] Having won, Luffy left the Going Merry to Usopp and solemnly walked away, kicking him out of the crew.[55] This did not affect their genuine concern for each other, however, as upon discovering the situation with Nico Robin, and his desire to help but knowing he could not face Luffy, he disguised himself as 'Sogeking' in order to help.[216] He succeeded in fooling Luffy, as well as Chopper, that he was not Usopp but failed with everybody else.[217] Under this disguise he successfully aided Luffy and the crew in their quest to save Robin.[218] At the end of the Enies Lobby Arc he was expecting to be welcomed back into the crew with open arms but panicked when he saw they were sailing away. The realization of his mistakes caused him to break down and scream out he is sorry, regretting his actions, which prompted Luffy to stretch his arms over and grab him, tearfully welcoming him back into the crew.[57] Luffy was actually more than prepared to allow Usopp to return, desperately wanting to do so, but was counseled by Zoro that doing so would tarnish his authority as captain and thus had to wait for him to apologize first. Therefore, when Usopp attempted to rejoin Luffy, the latter pretended that he could not hear him until the sniper gave a heartfelt apology.[96] Their friendship immediately recovered following his return and they continued with their shenanigans aboard their new ship, the Thousand Sunny.[219]

Usopp cares for Luffy and was devastated when Miss Merry Christmas told him that he had apparently died before refusing to believe her.[67] After hearing the news of Ace's death during the Summit War of Marineford he desperately tried to escape the island he was trapped on as he felt he needed to be there for Luffy.[63] He later resolved to become stronger for his captain’s sake after he received Luffy's message to wait two years. He trained with his new friend, Heracles, and made one of the most notable improvements among the Straw Hats.[220] He is also an adamant believer in Luffy's dream to become the Pirate King, being fully convinced that his captain will succeed and proudly declared so to both Mr. 4 and Miss Merry Christmas on Arabasta.[67] Although a coward, he will ridicule anyone who insults Luffy, even though he might be much weaker than them, and will defend his dream from people who laugh at it.[67] He notably remained defiant in front of Bartholomew Kuma when given the option to save his own life in exchange for Luffy's.[66] During Luffy's fight with Rob Lucci, he gave an emotional speech to his captain, reprimanding him for losing and even threatened the CP9 agent himself as a way to spur his captain to get back on his feet.[221] On Dressrosa, he became so worried about the thought of losing his memories of Luffy, due to Sugar's Devil Fruit abilities, that he awakened his Kenbunshoku Haki in order to accurately launch his attack to stop her turning Luffy into a toy.[222]

Usopp and Luffy Reunited
Usopp and Luffy reunited.

Despite generally looking down on people who are cowardly, such as Koby[223] and Shirahoshi,[224] Luffy has never insulted Usopp for his cowardly nature and treats him as an equal member of the crew. He is often concerned for Usopp's well-being as he is aware of his lack of fighting skills and timid personality when faced with danger, but still has faith in him. Luffy has shown to also be protective of Usopp, such as when Kuro went to attack him, and he intervened by punching Kuro to the ground.[225] Whilst fighting the Black Cat Pirates he became furious with them when they began to laugh at Usopp and threatened them.[226] After Usopp was brutally assaulted by the Franky Family, he became extremely angry and attacked all of them alongside Zoro, Sanji, and Chopper, whilst destroying their house in the process.[59][227] After the timeskip, he has gained a lot more confidence in Usopp's abilities and stopped Trafalgar Law from going after Caesar Clown because he knew Usopp could comfortably capture him.[228] He had no reservations with Usopp being involved in the Tontatta's plans, alongside Franky, as he believed he would be of great use to them.[229] He was also pleased that Cavendish acknowledged Usopp for his success in defeating Sugar and ending her Devil Fruit ability over the people of Dressrosa.[230] He also seems to view Usopp's habit of lying as an admirable skill, remarking to Arlong that, alongside not being able to use swords, navigate or cook, he is also not capable of lying as Usopp can.[231]

A key feature of their friendship is how often they like to fool around and have fun, occasionally doing impersonations of other crew members such as Zoro, Sanji and Chopper.[232][233] Like some of the others, Usopp fears his captain’s affinity for adventure and panicked when he realized Luffy had overheard how the New World Log Pose works and tried to tell Nami to destroy it.[74] When he discovered that Luffy had partnered with Law, in order to take on an emperor, he became frantic[28] and tried to overrule this decision with a vote.[234] He has become one of the characters to occasionally beat up Luffy for saying or doing silly things, even by his standards.[235] When he found out about Luffy's father being Monkey D. Dragon, and his grandfather being Monkey D. Garp, he was left completely stunned.[156][236] Usopp is the only other member of the Straw Hats, alongside Nami, to have worn Luffy's hat, very briefly doing so during the Long Ring Long Land Arc after he made Luffy wear an afro for his fight with Foxy.[86] Before leaving with Zoro to get Nami back, he returned Luffy's straw hat to him after he lost it when he tried to attack Dracule Mihawk.[237] They both share a similar desire of meeting the Red Hair Pirates, with Luffy wanting to reunite with Shanks and Usopp wanting to reunite with his father.[192] They are both extremely prone to being amazed by pretty much anything, such as ninjas,[238] Franky's robotic inventions[228][239] and Bon Clay's Devil Fruit abilities.[240]

Sanji
“	Be sure to come back, Sanji! Without you...I can't become the Pirate King!	”
— Luffy telling Sanji he still needs him on his crew.[241]

Luffy and Sanji Meet First Time
Luffy and Sanji meet for the first time.

Sanji is a former cook of the Baratie and the fourth member to join the Straw Hats. He is arguably one of Luffy's favorite crew mates because of his incredible cooking skills that satisfies his gluttonous nature. He is somewhat more antagonistic to Luffy than most, as he gets frustrated by his reckless nature and dimwitted-ness, but nonetheless respects him immensely and values him as his captain and as his friend. He was in tears from having to fight Luffy after he had left the crew and was delighted to return to them, as was Luffy, who was excited for him to cook again.[242]

The two first met during the Baratie Arc when Luffy was caught up in a dispute with the Head Chef, Zeff, for damaging the Baratie.[243] When a starving Gin entered the restaurant and threatened the staff there he was kicked out, however, Sanji still gave him a dish to eat despite his actions. Luffy, seeing this act, was impressed and was insistent he join his crew, but he refused.[34][244] Soon after, Don Krieg arrived and threatened to claim the Baratie into his fleet,[245] prompting Luffy to fight him.[246] After being inspired by Luffy's fearless and determined victory over Don Krieg,[247] and overhearing his colleagues' desire to see him achieve his dream of finding the All Blue,[248] he agreed to join Luffy's crew and gave an emotional farewell to Zeff and everyone at the Baratie.[249]

Since joining he has been the official chef of the Straw Hats and regularly makes everyone’s food. Although he admitted to Luffy that he prioritizes the women first and cooks the leftovers for him and the others, Luffy was not at all bothered by this as his food still tasted good.[250] On top of being the cook he is one of Luffy's most capable combatants and is easily in the top four strongest members of the Straw Hats having earned the fourth highest bounty within the crew, standing at Beli1,032,000,000.[109] He has proven to be extremely valuable to Luffy and has taken on some of the strongest opponents such as Kuroobi, Bon Clay, Jabra, Absalom, Vergo, Donquixote Doflamingo, Charlotte Daifuku, X Drake and Queen. He also works well with him as a fighting partner and even fought by his side against Big Mom.[251] Besides regularly fighting by his side in battle he has made a habit of saving Luffy whenever he can. He saved Luffy immediately after his victory over Don Krieg when he fell into the water,[252] again when he freed Luffy after he had been trapped underwater at Arlong Park[253] and when escaping Crocodile's casino via a flooded tunnel.[93] Whilst in Loguetown, he desperately tried to save Luffy from Buggy's attempt to execute him[115] and even fought Smoker, alongside Luffy, whilst they escaped.[254] Sanji was also the one responsible for freeing Luffy, as well as Zoro, Nami, Usopp, and Smoker, from Crocodile's cage.[255] After Luffy had fought Big Mom in his Gear 4 form, Sanji carried him away from the emperor to keep him safe.[256] Later, he waited patiently for his captain’s return from his fight with Charlotte Katakuri[257] and proceeded to carry an unconscious Luffy from Cacao Island back to the Thousand Sunny, fighting through hordes of Big Mom’s crew and suffering numerous injuries along the way.[258]

Luffy loves Sanji's cooking and will stop whatever he is doing in order to have whatever he makes.[235] After the timeskip Luffy was excited to eat more of Sanji's food, having gone two years without any, but had to settle for the food Boa Hancock gave him as Sanji was unconscious.[259] When Sanji had returned to the crew, following the events on Whole Cake Island, Luffy became excited when he said he would cook something for them.[242] He values Sanji highly as part of his crew and outright stated that he cannot become the Pirate King without him which caused Sanji to burst into tears.[54] Due to Sanji's honest personality, Luffy rarely gets annoyed with him but did so when he would not admit he wanted to come back to the crew and punched him in response[260] even though he had refused to fight back against him earlier.[261] Luffy also bears a grudge on Sanji's behalf, as he disregards all but one of Sanji's family members because of how cruelly they treat him. When Vinsmoke Judge questioned Luffy as to why he was so determined to get Sanji back in his crew, listing all of his 'faults', Luffy simply said goodbye and asked why he was listing all the good things about Sanji.[262] Luffy's trust in Sanji is so high that he gave him the authority of captain when he, along with Nami, Chopper, Brook, as well as their prisoner, Caesar Clown, was forced to leave Dressrosa with the Thousand Sunny whilst being chased by the Big Mom Pirates.[30]

After he had discovered that Sanji had been taken away to Big Mom's territory his determination for Sanji was put on full display.[99] He traveled to the emperor's territory,[263] gatecrashed the wedding,[264] fought against Big Mom,[265] her army[266] and Sweet Commanders Charlotte Cracker[267] and Katakuri,[268] for an extensive amount of time against both of them, just to make sure he could get Sanji to return. Even after Sanji's assault on him he still promised that he would not move from where he was stood nor eat any food unless it was made by him,[241] showing Luffy's deep understanding of Sanji's principles as a chef. He stuck by this promise and even declined Reiju's offer for food despite how badly his health had deteriorated.[269] He was furious with Cracker’s comments over Sanji's loyalty and attacked the Sweet Commander for saying Sanji would prefer to live a life of luxury with his new family than to come back to his crew.[270] Luffy did not waver in the face of Sanji's stubbornness when he refused to return and chose to take the full brunt of Sanji's attacks without retaliating.[241] Such was Luffy's desire for Sanji to return he was more than willing to allow his bride to join the crew so long as Sanji came back with her but was disappointed to find out that the marriage would mean they'd join have to join the Big Mom Pirates.[271] When Sanji requested Luffy's help to save his family, as they were about to be assassinated by Big Mom and her crew, Luffy accepted immediately as he understood that he could not force Sanji to leave his family behind.[272]

Sanji Carrying Luffy to Safety
Sanji carries Luffy to safety.

Sanji is incredibly dedicated to Luffy and competed with Zoro to be the one to take Luffy's place when Bartholomew Kuma tried to take him away but was knocked out by the swordsman.[273] Even though he was not happy being stuck with the Okama, he remained there for two years in order to get stronger for Luffy's sake.[274] Luffy's strength greatly impresses Sanji, and he was not surprised to see Luffy being able to use Haoshoku Haki, remarking that he suspected he was capable of such a thing.[275] When Pudding worried over Luffy's chances against her brother, Katakuri, he calmly told her that her brother will experience his first defeat.[276] When meeting Monkey D. Garp, Sanji remarked on his incredible strength and was shocked when he found out he is Luffy's grandfather, and even more shocked by the identity of his father, Monkey D. Dragon.[277] Sanji is also a firm believer in Luffy's dream to become the Pirate King and told Capone Bege that he would never do anything to risk it and told him that Luffy would succeed in this goal.[278] Although he mocked this dream when he fought Luffy, this was only because he wanted to try and discourage him from chasing after him.[279] Whilst he did leave the crew, he did so with great reluctantance, but was forced to do so under the threat of his former colleagues, adoptive family, and friends being killed.[278][280] It was clear he intended to return when he arrived on Whole Cake Island, however, as despite genuinely liking Charlotte Pudding, who was his betrothed, he initially refused to marry her so he could go back to Luffy.[281] Sanji also appeared guilt ridden for his actions towards Luffy as, echoing Zoro's beliefs, he stated he had lost the right to rejoin the crew for attacking his captain, but he quickly gave in to Luffy's refusal of this excuse.[272]

Whilst he has respect for Luffy as his captain, he is not above attacking or insulting Luffy for his stupidity. He has chastised his captain if he does anything to a woman, he perceives to be unbecoming, such as when he punched Vivi,[282] when he believed that he had done something terrible to Nico Robin,[283] or any time he argues with Nami. Due to his lustful desires, Sanji has been seen from time to time getting jealous of Luffy, such as when he discovered that he had been sent to Amazon Lily by Kuma, an island inhabited by the Kuja Tribe that are made up exclusively of women, and for having gained the affection of the Pirate Empress, Boa Hancock.[284] He was also seen to be jealous of Luffy for gaining the admiration of Shirahoshi, shouting at him that he is a lucky bastard when she hugged him after he had saved her.[285] Luffy's eating habits and endless appetite can be a source of frustration for him as well.[286] This has led him to set up numerous safeguards to stop him from emptying the fridge during the night and whenever food goes missing his first suspect is always Luffy. He was also annoyed and embarrassed when Luffy had discovered his raid suit that was given to him by Niji, with Luffy begging him to try it on.[287]

Tony Tony Chopper
“	SHUT UP!!! LET'S GO!!!!	”
— Luffy denying Chopper's refusal to join his crew.[288]

Luffy Tells Chopper to Join
Luffy tells Chopper to shut up and join his crew.

Tony Tony Chopper is a doctor from Drum Island who was formerly under the service of Dr. Kureha and was a student of the late Dr. Hiriluk. He is the fifth member to join the Straw Hats, the first Devil Fruit user and is the crew’s doctor. Due to being the youngest member of the crew he is very impressionable of Luffy and gets involved in his silly antics despite his innocent nature. The two greatly respect each other and he admires Luffy as his captain, only questioning him whenever he is at risk of injuring himself or does not adhere to his medical orders. His admiration stems from Luffy accepting him for who he is, as opposed to a monster by nearly everybody else.

After Luffy had carried Nami and Sanji to the top of the mountain where Chopper resides with Dr. Kureha, he found the trio and nursed them all back to health, having been amazed by Luffy's effort for his friends.[289] He got off to a chaotic start with him as he is an extremely timid person and was thrown off by Luffy's eccentric and bubbly personality. He was chased by Luffy when he was hungry as he was tempted to eat Chopper, but in reality, he wanted to ask him to join his crew.[290] He was moved by Luffy's determination to protect his pirate flag, which belonged to Dr. Hiriluk, atop his home from Wapol's attacks[291] and became grateful after he had defeated the former king.[292] Still, he refused to join Luffy's crew despite desperately wanting to do so, but whilst trying to explain how being half human and half reindeer made him a monster, and as to why he cannot join, Luffy flat out told him to shut up and to come with them, causing Chopper to cry and agree to join him.[288]

He is grateful to Luffy, not just for accepting him for who he is, but for also being interested in him and his abilities. The fact that Luffy is not at all fazed by his appearance, having been treated so poorly by reindeers and humans for much of his life,[293] makes him happy. Luffy, and the crew's acceptance of him has given him a family and the confidence to interact with people again. He is a determined member of the crew as he always looks to help Luffy in any way he can, from fighting to medical aid. Although he is not as brave as Zoro, he is not as cowardly as Usopp either, having shown he is a capable fighter despite his bounty only being Beli100. His former teacher, Dr. Hiriluk, first introduced him to what a pirate is, with Hiriluk leaving a strong, positive, impression on Chopper on the ideal pirate, and has come to see Luffy as the personification of the pirate Dr. Hiriluk was talking about.[294] Chopper has become a faithful admirer of Luffy and is constantly astounded by his impressive feats, especially when he goes beyond his human limitations, however, the excessiveness of how far Luffy pushes himself can irritate Chopper as a doctor. He was stunned when he found out that Luffy had developed an extremely strong immunity to most poisons.[295] He inquired to Luffy if he defeated Charlotte Katakuri and was amazed when he replied that he had.[296] After receiving Luffy's message to wait two years, Chopper resolved to become a "monster" so he can become stronger for Luffy's sake.[297] Like the other members of the crew, Chopper firmly believes that Luffy will become the Pirate King and reassures a sobbing Mocha that Luffy will defeat Caesar Clown because of this.[70]

Chopper and Luffy Eating a Cafe
Chopper and Luffy indulge themselves by eating a café.

Luffy is very friendly with Chopper and acts as an older brother of sorts. He does not patronize him for being the youngest member of the crew and treats him on an equal footing with everybody else. He often gets caught up in a lot of fun with Chopper as they mess around on the ship quite a lot.[298] When Sanji was given his raid suit by his brother, both Chopper and Luffy fantasied about trying it on and desperately wanted Sanji to use it for their own entertainment.[299] He has complete faith in Chopper’s abilities as a medic and demonstrated this when he allowed the children on Punk Hazard to suffer from withdrawal symptoms on Chopper’s orders.[300] Such is this faith, he intentionally allowed himself to be afflicted with the Mummy (Virus) because he knew Chopper could cure him.[301] He also listens to Chopper from time to time about his health, although this tends to be rare. Luffy also has faith in Chopper's fighting abilities and is never too worried about his well-being during battles, full believing in his strength, such as when he trusted him to take on Wapol's subordinates.[291] They both also possess a strong sweet tooth, as shown when they arrived on Cacao Island and ate Charlotte Pudding's cafe.[302] Some of the other crew members have concerns about how much of an impression Luffy has on the young Chopper, not wanting him to lose his innocence.[303]

As a comedic gag, Chopper will jump into the water to try and save Luffy whenever he is drowning, having forgotten he is also a Devil Fruit user and cannot swim.[304] This has led to Chopper copying Luffy's party trick of sticking two chopsticks up his nose and into the bottom of his mouth.[305] Although Luffy greatly values Chopper, he has found himself contemplating eating Chopper whenever he has begun to starve such as on their way to Totto Land.[306] Chopper is also prone to emotional outbursts whenever Luffy is in danger or appears close to death, he notably doubted his own medical skills when Luffy was poisoned Armored Stonefish.[307] Both of them also share a childish mentality, as they were both fooled by Usopp's alter-ego, Sogeking.[308] They also get amazed by numerous things, such as ninjas,[309] robots[310] and superhero suits.[299] Both Luffy and Chopper possess the ability to understand animals, Luffy because he possesses the ability to hear the "Voice of All Things"[311] and Chopper because he is half reindeer,[303] although this ability is much more inconsistent for Luffy.

Nico Robin
“	Robin! I haven't heard you say it! SAY YOU WANT TO LIVE!!!!	”
— Luffy to Robin after burning the World Government flag at Enies Lobby.[312]

Robin Asks Luffy About Alliance With Law
Robin asks Luffy about his alliance with Law.

A former agent of Baroque Works, and Crocodile's right-hand woman, Nico Robin became the seventh member to join Luffy's crew and the third Devil Fruit user. Out of all his crew members, Robin is the one he shares a complete wholesome relationship with as the two get on extremely well and have yet to be seen arguing. After she rejoined the Straw Hats, following the Enies Lobby Arc, she has continued being a reliable and devoted friend to Luffy. She is the archaeologist of the Straw Hats and deciphers the Poneglyphs for them.

Luffy and Robin briefly met for the first time as he and his crew sailed out of Whiskey Peak where she boarded his ship, temporarily took his hat, offered some advice for their next location, and left.[313] Luffy was very mixed on how to view her as she seemed friendly but still worked for the enemy, ultimately, he chose to distrust her and destroyed the log pose she had given him.[313] They met again when Robin saved Luffy after his first fight with Crocodile and made it apparent she has an interest in him because he carries the initial, "D.", in his name.[314] Later, she saved Luffy's life again by providing the antidote for the poison Luffy had been afflicted with by Crocodile after his victory against him.[315] When Luffy woke up, he chose to save her from the collapsing underground grave despite her protests. She then turned up on the Going Merry as the Straw Hats sailed away from Arabasta and argued that Luffy had forced her to live and thus should take responsibility by letting her join his crew, with Luffy accepting this proposal without hesitation, shocking everyone with the exception of Sanji.[40][316]

The two get on extremely well with each other. Their interactions can be somewhat infrequent compared to the rest of the Straw Hats, but when they do interact it is always positive. They both deeply care for each other and respect one another’s abilities. Robin's relationship with Luffy can best be described as motherly, as she has been seen feeding Luffy some of her food[317] and, out of all the crew members, is by far the most patient and calm with him. She is not at all irritated by his stupidity, recklessness, or carelessness, unlike the rest of the crew, and in fact, seems to admire these qualities. She tends to smile, and sometimes laugh, at Luffy's antics, which was first seen back on Arabasta when Luffy decided to drink a full barrel of water in order to take on Crocodile, causing her to chuckle at his bizarre improvisation.[318] She also has a keen interest in Luffy since they first met, taking a liking to the Straw Hat captain's bold and upfront personality. This interest in her captain has been prevalent since she first met him and whilst talking to Gan Fall on Skypiea she acknowledged his comment on Luffy's strange aurora that reminds him of Gol D. Roger, telling him that Luffy is a very interesting person.[319] Although this interest was an initial motive behind her decision to join his crew, she has come to see Luffy as a genuinely close friend.

She is very grateful to Luffy for having saved her life, twice. Due to her past, where she lost her family and friends and became an orphaned child[320][321] hunted by the World Government,[322] she struggled to find a place she could call home until she met Luffy. Whilst thinking of her past, she remembered her friend, Jaguar D. Saul, tell her that one day she will find people that will risk everything for her sake[323] and came to the conclusion that Luffy and his crew are the friends she has been longing for.[324][325] It was Luffy who convinced her to keep living even if the world does not want her to, with these words having a great impact on her. She no longer felt lonely by the fact that she was chased by the World Government as Luffy pointed out to her that he and his crew are also enemies of the world. Slowly, but surely, she became more comfortable with Luffy and his crew and began to open up, bonding with Luffy and growing to respect him as her captain and, more importantly, her friend. Her friendship with Luffy developed to such a point that, following the Summit War of Marineford, she was shown to be greatly relieved that Luffy was well[326] before receiving his message to wait two years. After reflecting on all the things Luffy has done for her, she decided to try and become stronger for his sake. Whilst blushing, she noted that the idea of doing such a thing has never occurred to her before.[327]

Similar to Zoro, she is completely accepting of Luffy's decisions as captain and does not hesitate in any situation she is put into by his reckless adventuring. She is often among the first people to follow Luffy into battle and is fully prepared to take on whoever is put in her way for the sake of helping him. She was the one to save Luffy after his fight against Rob Lucci by using her Devil Fruit abilities to carry him onto the Going Merry.[328] Whilst on Sabaody Archipelago, she saved an exhausted Luffy from being attacked by a Pacifista and a monster Chopper by carrying him under her arms.[329] Due to being very accepting of Luffy's decisions, she rarely offers up advice but has occasionally done so, such as when, after Luffy had formed an alliance with Trafalgar Law, she warned him that, although she is happy to go along with him, alliances are often marred by betrayals and that he should be certain he can trust Law.[28] After discovering Sanji's situation, Robin advised Luffy again by warning him about the strength of Big Mom when he proposed trying to get Sanji back, which prompted Luffy to decide to try and sneak into the emperor's territory instead.[99] She also has a fundamental understanding of how Luffy's mind works and has come to be one of the very few people who is capable of helping Luffy understand information or scenarios that are originally too complex for him. She clarified to Luffy the situation between Smoker and Tashigi when he was fighting them both on Punk Hazard,[330] and when Luffy could not remember who Marco was, despite everyone telling him he had met the Whitebeard Pirates' First Division Commander at the Summit War of Marineford, Robin was able to jog his memory by simply telling him he is the person who looks like a pineapple.[331]

Robin Feeding Luffy
Robin feeds Luffy some of her food whilst riding through Punk Hazard.

Luffy cares for Robin immensely and does not tolerate anyone hurting or taking her away. He has faith in her abilities as a fighter and trusts her whenever she goes out on her own to complete tasks. On Skypiea, he was furious when he found a heavily wounded Robin after she fought Enel and held onto her as she explained that Nami had been taken away by him.[58] During his encounter with the Admiral, Aokiji, he became furious when he threatened to take Robin away. When he proceeded to turn her into ice and tried to smash her, Luffy was just about able to save her.[332] He was upset and angry after being told that Robin had been taken against her will by CP9 in order to keep him, and the rest of the crew, safe and promised Nami to rescue her.[178] Such was his anger, he charged headfirst into Enies Lobby on his own,[47] fighting through a thousand Marines[48] and two CP9 agents,[49] including their strongest fighter, Lucci, just to reach her.[50] He was more than willing to burn the flag of the World Government to show Robin his complete disregard for them and his willingness to take on the world for her sake. This act of rebellion shocked Robin and caused her to cry at how far Luffy was willing to go just to save her. Luffy then passionately demanded her to say she wants to live and when Robin responded by saying she does and begged him to take her out to sea with him and his crew, he became even more determined to save her.[324] After his victory over Lucci, he called out to Robin and told her that they will all leave Enies Lobby together, causing her to cry.[50] When on Sabaody, Luffy tried to reach out and save Robin from Bartholomew Kuma but failed to do so, with her being the final crew member he lost to the Warlord before being sent away himself.[62]

Robin's faith in Luffy is absolute, like most of the crew, and she is often impressed by the actions of her captain. Whilst on Skypiea, she played a key role in convincing Wyper, a hostile Shandia warrior, to aid Luffy by informing him of the reason why he wants to ring the famous Shandorian Bell and expressed admiration for her captain's determination.[333] Following the time-skip, she was impressed by the improvements Luffy had made and was astonished when he used Haoshoku Haki to knock out 50,000 of Hody Jones' crew.[123] Although, for the first time since she met him, she expressed genuine horror over Luffy's actions when news that he had been captured by the Emperor, Kaidou, reached her.[334] She showed her faith in Luffy whilst being escorted by Spandam and Lucci, as she became elated when he had finally caught up to her and could not help but smile when she heard his voice call out her name.[335] When Nekomamushi warned her that a person of her abilities, to read Poneglyphs, is rare and that a lot of people would try to kidnap her, she simply responded that she has faith in her captain and crew to not allow such a thing to happen because they are strong, causing Luffy to comically blush over the compliment and state he would fight anyone for her.[336]

Due to her knowledge of world affairs, she was greatly surprised, and intrigued, upon discovering that Monkey D. Garp is Luffy's grandfather[154] and Monkey D. Dragon is his father.[156] She was further surprised to hear that he has connections with the Emperor, Red-Haired Shanks, and asked Nami for clarification whilst finding Luffy all the more interesting.[236] Out of all the Straw Hats, including Luffy himself, Robin is the only one who has met Luffy's father, Dragon, doing so during the timeskip.[326][327] Luffy has shown he is well aware of how intelligent Robin is, such as when he complimented her to Iceburg,[337] and will often turn to her whenever he wants to know information about certain individuals, including his own father.[156]

Franky
Luffy Impressed by Franky
Luffy impressed by Franky's upgraded physique.

Franky is the former head of the Franky Family, the seventh person to join the Straw Hats and is the shipwright of the crew. He is responsible for building their new ship, the Thousand Sunny. He and Luffy share a good bond and get on extremely well. Franky acts as a sort of older brother to his captain and enjoys entertaining him with his various inventions and robotic body. He has tremendous trust in Luffy's abilities, respects him as captain and holds great admiration for him. Luffy is often amazed by Franky's cyborg body and finds him to be greatly entertaining. He has complete faith in his skills as the shipwright and as a fighter.

The two first met on Water 7[338] and got off to a bad start when Franky and his family assaulted and robbed Usopp.[339] This seriously angered Luffy and led to the Straw Hat captain, as well as Zoro, Chopper, and Sanji, beating up the Franky Family and destroying the Franky House.[340] This, in turn, led to Franky wanting revenge and he attacked Luffy in broad daylight whilst he was with Nami.[341] Their fight was soon interrupted, however, and Luffy successfully fled.[342] Franky was later attacked by CP9 whilst with Usopp[343] and the two were taken hostage, along with Robin.[344] He ends up becoming an ally to the Straw Hats after being inspired by Luffy's determination to save his crewmate and finding a common enemy in CP9.[345] After successfully doing so he received his first bounty for his role[346] and was convinced to join the Straw Hats as their official shipwright[37] after building them the Thousand Sunny from the Adam Wood he had bought with the money stolen from Usopp.[347]

Throughout the Enies Lobby Arc, Franky came to respect and understand Luffy. He was amazed by his strength and determination to save his crew and wished to aid him directly in his fight with Rob Lucci but agreed to try and save Robin for him instead.[348] When he discovered Luffy's family members he was stunned at how notorious they all are and commented that it partly explains how he is so strong.[277] Franky's respect was such that he personally wished for Luffy and his crew to sail the rest of their journey in a ship he built, deeming them worthy.[277] He wished to join Luffy's crew but was conflicted with his wish to remain on Water 7 due to still being guilt-ridden about his mentor's death. After Robin and Iceburg were able to convince him to move on he agreed to join Luffy's crew. After being separated by Bartholomew Kuma on Sabaody Archipelago, and receiving Luffy's message to wait two years, he chose to spend his time modifying his robotic body in order to become more useful, and more capable, for his captain. Franky proudly declared to Nami that they are a member of the crew that will make Luffy the Pirate King when he faced the Emperor, Big Mom.[349]

Luffy and Franky in Dressrosa
Disguised Luffy and Franky intimidating one of Doflamingo's henchmen.

Luffy has a great amount of trust and respect for Franky. He completely accepts his knowledge as a shipwright and mechanic, and although he rarely understands what he is talking about, he trusts him anyway. Luffy also acknowledges him as a capable fighter, happy to have him by his side in a fight and has faith in Franky completing individual missions, such as recovering the Thousand Sunny whilst on Punk Hazard and aiding the Tontatta Kingdom. Such is Luffy's trust in him, he was willing to let Franky eat his late brother's Devil Fruit, the Mera Mera no Mi, despite not wanting anyone else to have it. Due to his child-like mentality, he is easily amazed by Franky's cyborg modifications, something Franky happily indulges him in, and is left dumbfounded by some of the weapons and constructions he makes, especially General Franky. He believes Franky epitomizes a boy’s dream.

Franky shares a similar outgoing personality like Luffy, but without the stupidity, which helps them get along. Due to Franky's emotional sensitivities, he has sometimes cried profusely with, or for, Luffy. He is very laid back with his captain and finds him funny and endearing. He still respects his authority, though, and asked for his permission to aid the dwarves whilst on Dressrosa and was overjoyed to hear Luffy approve his request. He refused Luffy's offer to eat the Mera Mera no Mi as he did not wish to give up his ability to swim but encouraged Luffy to go and retrieve his deceased brother’s Devil Fruit, despite being aware that it is probably a trap, as this might be his only chance and if it slips away, he will regret it. Despite having gotten used to Luffy's reckless nature, he was left in complete horror after discovering he had been captured by the Emperor, Kaidou. He was subsequently relieved Luffy broke out and gathered followers.

Brook
Luffy Asks Brook to Join Again
Luffy once again asks Brook to join.

Brook is the former musician, and acting captain, of the Rumbar Pirates. He is the eighth person to join the Straw Hats, the third Devil Fruit user and is the oldest member of the crew. He is one of Luffy's most loyal crew members. The two get on extremely well due to their similar upbeat and eccentric personalities. Their relationship is defined by their identical childish nature. Brook is continuously excited and bubbly and finds the joy in most situations just like his captain. Luffy adores Brook because of his music, his humor and for being a skeleton. Brook will often play songs for Luffy and the crew with piano, violin, or guitar.

Luffy first met Brook as he traveled through the Florian Triangle and sailed past the skeleton's ship. The Straw Hats spotted him and immediately became frightened, apart from Luffy who was bemused and intrigued. He boarded Brook’s ship and, after finding him hilarious, he immediately asked him to join his crew, much to the chagrin of his crew mates. Brook accepted and went to their ship and explained his past, and current, situation. He ultimately declined Luffy's offer to join his crew as he could not leave the Florian Triangle without his shadow that had been taken by Gecko Moria. However, Luffy immediately decided to get Brook’s shadow back so he could join. Once he succeeded in defeating Gecko Moria, and returning his shadow, Luffy found Brook still somewhat hesitant to join his crew as he had a commitment to a whale he had befriended, called Laboon, and wished to know if he is still alive. Luffy and his crew also met Laboon when they first entered the Grand Line and Luffy happily informed him of the whale's well-being. Brook cried in relief at this news and revealed his wanted poster to pledge his loyalty to Luffy.

Their relationship is immensely positive, and they get on very well with each other. They also respect each other’s positions, with Luffy being the captain and Brook being the musician and the second swordsman of the crew, after Zoro. They both acknowledge each other’s capabilities as Brook always believes that Luffy will win his fights and Luffy trusts Brook to handle the situations he finds himself in. His trust in Brook is so high that he allowed him to join Pedro to recover the Road Poneglyph that is in Big Mom's possession, an extremely important task that is fundamental to finding Laugh Tale where the One Piece is allegedly located. Although not as skilled as his compatriot, Zoro, he has proven himself to be a talented and capable swordsman for Luffy. He also holds the special accolade of being the only member of the Straw Hats, besides Luffy himself, to have fought an Emperor in one-on-one combat. Furthermore, Brook has proven himself to be the lynchpin for plans to come to fruition for the Straw Hats. He successfully acquired the Road Poneglyph from Big Mom, despite the emperor herself trying to stop him, and he also discreetly broke Mother Caramel's portrait in order to send Big Mom into a frenzy so the assassination plan could go ahead. On Wano, he discovered yet another Poneglyph whilst searching Orochi's castle.

Luffy And Brook Drink Milk
Brook and Luffy enjoy some milk to repair their bones and teeth.

Brook is extremely grateful for Luffy welcoming him into the Straw Hats due to having spent the last fifty years alone and has experienced extreme isolation and depression from losing all of his friends. Luffy was able to end that misery by giving him a family to call his own among the Straw Hats. Just the offer of joining his crew brought Brook a lot of happiness because he has been alone for so long. It is because of this that Brook’s loyalty to Luffy is extremely high and prefers to only take orders from him, as he initially declined Momonosuke's request to provide entertainment, stating he only takes orders from his captain. He also feels a special bond with his captain over their shared friendship with Laboon. Even crying tears of joy that the whale is still alive. After the two-year timeskip, he was in tears when he reunited with Luffy, stating that he had missed him so much and happily gave up his life as a rock-star in order to return to the crew. He tends to join Luffy, alongside Usopp and Chopper, in immature antics and will often indulge and encourage some of Luffy's childlike behavior. He is a firm believer that Luffy will become Pirate King and proudly stated so whilst being held up by the Marines on Sabaody Archipelago during one of his concerts. Here he also revealed to his fans that Luffy is actually alive and will one day rule the seas before leaving the stage after a final song. During his fight with Zeo, he once again states that Luffy will become the Pirate King. Whilst fighting Big Mom, he praised his captain highly to her, informing the Emperor that there isn’t a wall that Luffy cannot breakthrough in the pursuit of his ambitions.

Luffy likes Brook a lot and respects him as a swordsman of the Straw Hats. Unlike the rest of the crew, he was immediately friendly with Brook and enjoys his company immensely. Luffy is greatly intrigued by him being a skeleton and enjoys his humor, especially the Skull Jokes that he makes. His initial impressions of Brook were so positive that he offered him a place on his crew despite having just met him, finding him hilarious, and chose to help Brook regain his shadow for the purpose of recruiting him. Another huge reason why Luffy likes him so much is that he is a musician, something Luffy has wanted in his crew since the start of his journey and even prioritized getting a musician before a doctor or a cook and is very fond of Brook’s rendition of Binks' Sake. Brook is also one of the few crew members that can consistently make him laugh.

Jinbe
Jinbe Donates Blood to Luffy
Jinbe donates his blood to Luffy.

Jinbe is a former ally of the Big Mom Pirates, the former captain of the Sun Pirates, and a former Warlord of the Sea, who is the ninth person to join the Straw Hats and is their helmsman. Luffy and Jinbe hold each other in the highest regard and share a relationship of mutual respect, with Jinbe acting as a key adviser to Luffy, whilst Luffy acknowledges his wisdom. Jinbe is amazed by Luffy's tenacity, strength, and kind-heartedness, and Luffy is impressed with his talents as a fighter and helmsman. Between Luffy's initial invitation for Jinbe to join his crew at Fish-Man Island to Jinbe officially joining at Onigashima, Luffy was frustrated by Jinbe's existing obligations keeping him from joining despite his desire to do so.

They first met in Impel Down when Luffy infiltrated the Marine base to rescue his brother, Ace, who Jinbe had been imprisoned with. Jinbe convinced Luffy to let him out as he wished to aid him in saving Ace as he considered him a good friend. He proved to be an extremely helpful ally when escaping out of Impel Down and during the Summit War of Marineford, where the two grew to respect each other. Having helped Luffy overcome Ace’s death the two parted on very good terms and wished to see each other again. They would meet on Fish-Man Island after two years and worked together to defeat Hody Jones and his crew, the New Fish-Man Pirates. Whilst receiving his blood after his fight, Luffy officially asked Jinbe to join his crew, but he declined due to business he had to attend to first but asked Luffy to make him the offer again when they next meet. They would meet again on Whole Cake Island where he saved Luffy and Nami from being tortured and worked with the Straw Hats to help Sanji escape and assassinate Big Mom. It was during the wedding ceremony that Jinbe officially declared to the Emperor that he will leave the Big Mom Pirates and join the Straw Hats.

The two share a great admiration for each other, as Jinbe came to highly respect Luffy for his reckless rescue effort in Impel Down just for his brother, and his incredible determination on the battlefield at Marineford, showing no fear despite some of the strongest individuals in the world being present. Jinbe possesses the unique ability to talk sense into Luffy and to get him to understand the precarious situation he finds himself in, hoping that the Straw Hat captain will act accordingly. Luffy respects Jinbe's counsel and tries to take in some of his reasoning before he acts. Although this has led the two to get into heated arguments, and at one point, a brief fight, but this was quickly resolved. He is one of Luffy's most powerful crew members and is in the top four strongest fighters, having the third-highest bounty in the crew at Beli1,100,000,000.[109] The two have fought alongside each other when they tried to escape Impel Down and proved to be a devastating force.

Jinbe has a high amount of admiration for Luffy and will try to protect and save him whenever he can. During the Summit War of Marineford he took on Gecko Moria in order to protect Luffy. Despite his desire for Luffy to not die, he agreed to his request to launch him over the barrier and onto the platform, allowing him to be the first to breach the Marines’ defense, even though Luffy would have to face all three Admirals on his own. His admiration reached a point where he bluntly told Admiral Akainu that he would happily lay down his life to protect Luffy, a monumental statement as Jinbe rarely respects anyone outside of the Whitebeard Pirates. He took a powerful hit from Akainu during his escape whilst carrying Luffy, only to apologize to Luffy for allowing him to get hurt. He almost died because of it but managed to survive thanks to Trafalgar Law. Whilst talking to Law he stated how greatly worried he was for Luffy and his well-being once he realizes that Ace is dead. He chose to stay by Luffy's side whilst he recovered on Amazon Lily and was the key to helping him come to terms with Ace’s death, reminding him that he still has people to live for, namely his crew. On Fish-Man Island he offered up his own blood when Luffy had lost a lot of his, despite being a Fish-Man in a country that forbids fish-men sharing blood with humans. He saved both Luffy and Nami from Charlotte Opera and freed them both from captivity. He saved Luffy from Katakuri's attack by throwing tea on the Sweet Commander’s leg which nullified his Devil Fruit abilities. When he announced his decision to leave the Big Mom Pirates he had no fear of the emperor's wrath, rendering her Devil Fruit powers useless, and proudly stated to her that he has no fear because he is joining the crew of the next Pirate King.[73] He praised Luffy highly to his crew in the immediate aftermath of Pedro's death, recognizing his qualities as captain for not getting caught up in his emotions and instead took Katakuri away to the Mirro-World so his crew could set sail.

Luffy reciprocates the respect Jinbe has for him and talked positively of him to his crewmates, acknowledging him as the reason why he survived the war. His praise for him encouraged Nami to forgive Jinbe for his indirect role in Arlong's oppression of Cocoyashi Village and who had tormented her since childhood. Luffy values Jinbe as his ally and crewmate and appreciated how much he tried to help him during the Summit War of Marineford, as well as helping him bounce back from Ace’s death. By the end of the Fish-Man Island Arc, he gleefully requested Jinbe to join his crew and was extremely disappointed when he declined but made him promise him that once he had completed his unfinished business, he would find him again so he could join his crew, with Jinbe promising to do so. He was happy to be reunited with Jinbe on Whole Cake Island and was overjoyed when he announced to Big Mom of his decision to join the Straw Hats. He was extremely happy to have him as part of his crew and trusted him to look after Brook, Carrot, Nami, and Chopper whilst he was away fighting Katakuri. He was very annoyed by Jinbe's decision to not travel with him and his crew to Wano but understood that he could not leave his former crew behind at the mercy of the Big Mom Pirates. Luffy then reminded Jinbe that he is his captain now and ordered him to not die and reunite with him in Wano.[350] After escaping Big Mom's territory, the newspaper arrived with reports of the events on Whole Cake Island, Luffy immediately wanted to read it to find out about Jinbe but could not find anything on him.[351] When Jinbe finally arrived on Wano and reunited with the crew Luffy was overjoyed.[352]

Jinbe Scolds Luffy
Jinbe helping Luffy overcome Ace's death.

Despite his vast experience and affiliations with some of the most notorious pirates, he is still left shocked by Luffy and his actions. He was stunned that he would infiltrate Impel Down for Ace, something that not even Whitebeard attempted. He was frustrated by Luffy's determination to fight Hody Jones despite the repercussions it would have on the relations between fish-men and humans, at one point calling him foolish, and he was further shocked at Luffy's declaration that he does not wish to be a hero. When Luffy defeated Katakuri, out of all the crew members, Jinbe was the most surprised, understanding what Luffy had achieved. He was intrigued when Fleet Admiral Sengoku revealed that Luffy is the son of Monkey D. Dragon but was not as surprised as a lot of the others.

He is capable of talking sense into Luffy and have him follow the plans that are best to tackle the situation they are in. The first time was during Impel Down when he convinced Luffy not to waste time fighting Blackbeard as Ace was more important, despite his own desires to attack Blackbeard. He was able to stop Luffy from heading back into Impel Down to try and rescue Bon Clay, explaining that doing so would make his sacrifice count for nothing. Whilst on Fish-Man Island he, despite a tedious process and a brief fight, convinced Luffy to follow his plan on making him a hero to Fish-Man Island, although he had to bribe him with meat. He was able to convince Luffy to work with Capone Bege despite Luffy's strong dislike of him for trying to kill Pekoms and was able to keep the peace at their meeting. He successfully had Luffy follow the plan to assassinate Big Mom as opposed to Luffy's usual habit of just charging into his fights.

Nefertari Vivi
X Mark Farewell
Vivi and Karoo bid the Straw Hat Pirates farewell.

Nefertari Vivi is a princess of the Arabasta Kingdom, a former undercover Baroque Works agent and a former member of the Straw Hat Pirates. She and Luffy are close friends, despite having started off as enemies, and see each other as family. Even though she is often amazed by his stupidity, laid back attitude, and recklessness, she completely trusts him and finds it incredible just how strong he is. Luffy sees Vivi as an extremely kind person and someone he wishes to help. However, he also thinks of her as naive and was reluctant to continue helping her at one point until she understood his reasoning. Nonetheless, he adores her and was filled with crushing disappointment when she did not join his crew.

He first met Vivi during the Reverse Mountain Arc whilst she was undercover as "Miss Wednesday", when she and her partner, Mr. 9, tried to kill Laboon for his meat but failed due to the intervention of Luffy and his crew. She met Luffy again on Whiskey Peak and attempted to fight the Straw Hat Pirates but this comically ended in failure. Once her identity as an undercover agent, as well as her history, were revealed to Luffy and the crew they agreed to help her. She traveled with the Straw Hats to various locations, such as Little Garden and Drum Island, and throughout their adventures grew very close to Luffy. Once they arrived in Arabasta she worked alongside Luffy and his crew to defeat Crocodile and end the uprising against her father, King Nefertari Cobra.

Vivi is often left astounded by Luffy's laid-back attitude and lack of concern for the dangerous situations he finds himself in. This attitude still endears her to him, and she was seen occasionally engaging in the crew's banter that tends to revolve around Luffy. She sometimes copies Luffy's antics, such as when he grabbed Usopp by his nose and she started to do the same. She is often worried about Luffy because of how far he pushes himself and felt the need to watch over him from time to time. She was distraught when Luffy was being relentlessly attacked by Mr. 5 whilst on Little Garden. Despite her concerns, she is reassured by the strength Luffy possesses and is left in shock at his raw power and was relieved when he finally arrived to save her, as well as Nami and Zoro, from Mr 3's candle wax. Although she is tolerant of Luffy's attitude to most things, she does try to counsel him on what it means to lead people, such as when they arrived on Drum Island and she explained to him that he could not convince the local residents to help him by beating them up, despite having shot at her. Nonetheless, she has great respect for him and is eternally grateful for his aid in saving Arabasta. When she was crossing the desert with Luffy she was upset by his statements regarding her wish to prevent conflict from happening in her kingdom and got into a fistfight with him, however, she came to accept Luffy's points, and she immediately reconciled. Her bond with Luffy strengthened from this exchange and now has absolute confidence in Luffy and his crew.

She became so close to Luffy and the others that she was almost willing to abandon her life as a princess and continue sailing with them but chose not to do so in the end. Vivi passionately follows the Luffy's adventures and was one of the very few people able to deduce that Luffy had a message for his crew when he rang the Ox Bell following the Summit War of Marineford. She was not at all upset when she discovered Nico Robin, a former ally of Crocodile, has joined Luffy's crew, instead choosing to trust his judgement. She becomes friends with both Rebecca and Shirahoshi through their shared admiration of Luffy.

Luffy values Vivi to such a degree that he was willing to help her fight Crocodile and save her kingdom and got angry at the Warlord of the Sea for the torment he had put Vivi and her kingdom through. He was furious when Crocodile taunted Vivi after they were captured by him. He cares for Vivi a great deal and is very upset when someone tries to harm her, such as when Mr. 5 attempted to do so whilst on Little Garden, and he came to her aid when Crocodile dropped her from the top of the palace plateau, catching her with the aid of Pell, and reassured her that although her voice could not reach everybody that was fighting, her voice reached him and his crew. Luffy is not afraid to criticize her outlook on the world as he got into an argument with her that ended in a fistfight as he tried to get her to understand that she cannot carry the burden of saving her kingdom on her own, and to let him and his crew aid her in defeating Crocodile as that was the best way to save her kingdom. He agreed with Crocodile that her views of stopping the conflict in Arabasta without bloodshed are foolish, but chooses to unwaveringly help her, nonetheless. He has praised her, however, and did so after she successfully showed him that pleading for the villagers on Drum Island to help them, when Nami was sick, was a better option than fighting them.

By the end of the Arabasta Saga, Luffy begged her to join his crew. Although Vivi contemplated permanently joining them, she, with a heavy heart, declined due to her responsibilities as a princess. This upset Luffy as he wanted to continue their adventures together. However, he sees her as an honorary member of the Straw Hats and cherishes the time he shared with her as a part of the crew. Before leaving, he and his crew reassured her that they see her as a full-fledged member of the Straw Hats by displaying the cross Vivi had marked on all of them as they sailed away, leaving her in tears of joy.

Despite being separated since the end of the Alabasta Saga and not having seen each other in more than two years, Luffy still cares a lot about Vivi. When the crew discovered Cobra's murder, as well as Vivi's disappearance in the Levely in which Sabo had attacked, Luffy was more than willing to attack Mary Geoise and openly declare a mass war against Marine Headquarters, and face all the Admirals just to make sure Vivi was okay, only not having done so because he was reminded by Zoro that Vivi was like Ace; strong and able to fend for herself.

In return, Vivi still respects and trusts Luffy a lot. Her interactions with him and the other Straw Hats and the time they spent together had a strong influence on her. During the trip to Levely, Vivi was excited that it had been a long time since she had been to sea, climbing to the top of the mast and commenting that she missed the salty sea breeze. At Levely, Vivi became friends with Rebecca, Shirahoshi, Leo and Sai due to them being friends and allies of the Straw Hats, when Vivi learned about the events in Dressrosa, she realized that Luffy and the others had decided to help someone else again. Due to this trust, as well as her honest and fair nature, Vivi was very angry and disgusted by the article that incriminated Luffy of kidnapping Dr. Vegapunk, knowing that Luffy was not the type of person who would do that.

Appearance
Further information: Monkey D. Luffy/Gallery
Luffy is a young man of average height with shaggy black hair, round black eyes, and a slim muscular build. He is renowned for his trademark straw hat (from which he gets his epithet "Straw Hat Luffy"), which was lent to him when he was young by the legendary pirate captain, "Red-Haired" Shanks,[38] who in turn received it from Gol D. Roger.[41] Before the timeskip, his main outfit consisted of a red vest, light blue denim shorts cuffed just above his knees, and tan sandals. Luffy also has a scar with two stitches underneath his left eye, which he earned as a child by stabbing his face to show Shanks that he was tough enough to be a pirate.[42] He was severely wounded by Akainu in the Summit War of Marineford,[43] leaving a large X-shaped scar on his chest.[44]

Before the Timeskip
Similar to most of his male crewmates, Luffy has the same outfit throughout most of the series. Luffy will often wear a different outfit to suit the climate of an island (such as a hooded parka on Drum Island[45] or desert robes in Arabasta[46]) but will switch back to his trademark red vest and blue shorts after the adventures on that island are over. Despite this, he will wear his usual outfit in different colors and has been known to sport other miscellaneous items on his person from time to time like in Thriller Bark and Sabaody Archipelago. According to Eiichiro Oda in 37 Volume SBS, Luffy does not know how to dress stylishly so sometimes he is advised on how to dress by more fashionable team members, Nami, Usopp, Sanji, and Robin.[47]

During the Drum Island Arc, he wore two different parkas, the first being a burgundy parka with white fur on the cuffs, hood, and hem,[45] and then a checkered, hooded parka with the colors white, orange, and bright yellow, which Nami wore in the beginning.[48]
During the Arabasta Arc, he wore desert robes consisting of a dark red robe with three white rings decorated along both sleeves and a light blue wrap over his head.[46]
During the Skypiea Arc, he wore his vest open and additionally wore a black wristband around his left wrist with a white bangle over it.[49] In 37 Volume SBS, Oda said that two members of his crew lent him accessories: a black wristband by Usopp and a white bracelet by Sanji.[47]
During the Long Ring Long Land Arc, Luffy wore an afro on his head, dark red shorts, and red bandages on his feet, getting an image of a blue flaming skull and crossbones painted on his chest as well, when he was fighting Foxy.[50]
During the Enies Lobby Arc, he wore black shorts with larger pockets than his blue shorts.
During the Post-Enies Lobby Arc, Luffy wore a white T-shirt with the Galley-La Company emblem on it in red; red liners around the top, shoulders, and collar; and navy-blue shorts.[51]
During the Thriller Bark Arc, he wore an orange vest and dark red shorts.[52] After the battle against Moria in Thriller Bark, Luffy wore a dark decorated, jeweled armband around his left bicep, given to him by Nami.[53] This armband was later revealed to be a map that leads to Captain John's lost treasure, which Buggy sought for some time; Luffy handed the armband over to Buggy in exchange for his services in navigating through Impel Down.[54]
During the Sabaody Archipelago Arc, in the manga, he wore a blue vest and red shorts (which can also be seen on the cover of Volume 52). In the anime, he wore the same blue vest, but dark blue shorts.[55]
During the Amazon Lily Arc, Luffy wore a light blue vest with maroon shorts.[56]
During the Impel Down Arc, Luffy wore his outfit from his stay on Amazon Lily until after his fight with Magellan, at which point he replaced his light blue vest with a bright yellow vest and brighter red shorts given to him by Inazuma.[57]
No matter where he is, Luffy wears his Straw Hat through absolutely everything, though at the start, the hat was prone to get knocked off his head easily, forcing Luffy to either put it aside or have someone hold onto it during fights. From the Arabasta Arc onward, he has gotten a string strap for it, which was sewn on by Nami, allowing the hat to hang on his back from his neck during fights.

During his return to Marineford to give a silent prayer, Luffy was briefly shown with four characters written on his right arm spelling 3D2Y,[58] with the 3D crossed out to symbolize that the Straw Hat Pirates should meet up in 2 years (2Y) rather than the 3 days (3D) as planned after fleeing from Bartholomew Kuma.[59]

During his journey, Luffy has used the power of his Devil Fruit in creative ways, many of which involve altering his body. The greatest example of his altered appearance is the creation of his Gear techniques which dramatically affect his entire body:

In Gear 2, Luffy pumps more blood throughout his whole body, causing his sweat to rapidly vaporize and making it appear that he is releasing steam. In the anime, his entire skin turns slightly pink and shiny from the increased blood flow.
In Gear 3 form, Luffy blows a massive amount of air into his body, causing it to inflate and enlarge a specific part of his body to a size equivalent to that of a Giant. After the transformation wears off, his body temporarily shrinks to a child-sized form, with large hands and a vertically compressed head. The properties and appearance of this technique changed after the two-year timeskip.
After the Timeskip
After those two years, a few things have changed. He has grown slightly taller and is shown to be significantly more muscular due to his training. This can be seen in his slightly thicker neck, more pronounced deltoids, and a better-defined chest, which shows the X-shaped scar he received by then-Admiral Akainu covering most of it.[60] His usual attire is mostly the same as it was two years ago, but instead of a vest, Luffy wears an open, 3/4-sleeved red cardigan with four buttons and with a yellow sash tied around his waist with the end hanging from his left hip (somewhat reminiscent of Gol D. Roger's outfit).

Due to Luffy's increasing notoriety in addition to the increasing strength of his foes, after the timeskip he finds himself more often dressed in disguises to mask his identity, with varying levels of sophistication. Despite this, he still never loses his trademark straw hat and instead opts to at times cover it with other headwear.

During the Punk Hazard Arc, Luffy wore a long winter coat with red and white horizontal stripes, along with yellow earmuffs and dark red gloves, which he stole from one of Brownbeard's Centaur Patrol Unit.[61] Just before leaving, he switched to a different coat that is all red with dark brown fur lining and a light brown belt, as well as brown gloves.
During the Dressrosa Arc, due to his need to hide his identity in Doflamingo's territory, Luffy wore an open, dark blue short-sleeved shirt with a sunflower pattern, his standard blue shorts and yellow sash, and a black bowler hat over his straw hat. He also wore a fake beard.[62] Upon entering the tournament for the Mera Mera no Mi in the Corrida Colosseum, he wore Viking-style armor, complete with a sword and shield.[63] Upon revision to meet the tournament's weight restriction, he got rid of most of the armor, but kept the cape and helmet, along with his registration number '0556' and the word "Lucy" written on the back of his shirt, obscured by his cape.[64] When he recovered after his battle against Doflamingo, Luffy wore a dark red tank top along with his standard shorts in brown (dark grey in the anime).[65]
As he and the newly formed 'Sanji Retrieval Team' departed from Zou, he swapped out his standard blue shorts for a brown pair.
During the Whole Cake Island Arc, Luffy wore an open, fancy white shirt with puffy sleeves, red trim, and an ornate gold pattern on the collar along with red shorts and his standard yellow sash. He also had a decorative scarf wrapped around his straw hat after landing at the Seducing Woods, though he appears to have lost it during his battle with Charlotte Cracker. These clothes were eventually torn to shreds after several battles and he later dons a new outfit to meet with Capone Bege; a brick red blazer with matching shorts, a black dress shirt, and a pink cravat. He also fitted a black fedora to the top of his straw hat.[66]
During his fight with Sanji, Luffy loses one of his top teeth after being struck by a Diable Jambe Joue Shot directly into his face.[67] However, it grew back after he drank a bottle of milk.[68]
During the Wano Country Arc, Luffy wore a red yukata with patchwork mon of a blue rounded sun on a cyan background and a yellow obi. He also had a topknot on top of his hair. He also had the Nidai Kitetsu he borrowed from Tenguyama Hitetsu.[69] Before beginning the assault on Onigashima, Luffy received a set of samurai armor from Hitetsu.[70] When helping Kin'emon and the others against Kaidou's fleet at sea, Luffy wore a long black coat, his usual red shirt, orange shorts and a purple sash.[71] He also briefly wore a Beasts Pirates disguise created by Kin'emon when infiltrating Onigashima, which consisted of fake red horns, black pauldrons with white lining, a black belt with white lining and the Beast Pirates jolly roger on the front, which is connected to the pauldrons by brown straps connecting to a silver ring, black leather pants, a red feather cape, orange gloves, and his regular sandals.[72] During his celebration of the Raid's success, Luffy wears another red yukata, this one with a blue sash and yellow-and-white hexagonal patterns. In the following days, he wears a third red yukata with a purple ocean wave pattern and an orange sash. As he leaves Wano, he is seen wearing his Raid outfit, though his orange shorts were swapped for yellow ones.
During the Egghead Arc, Luffy received a long red coat with orange-yellow accents and the SSG logo, along with gloves, an earpiece, and a pair of red DOM Shoes.[73] During his fight with Kizaru, he discarded this attire, remaining in his original shorts and sandals.[74]
After the two-year timeskip, Luffy developed another two Gears, with one of them having its own sub-transformations, as well as significantly changing Gear 3:

During Luffy's two years of training, he further developed Gear 3 to have the air concentrated into his fist and a large sphere of air in his wrist, as opposed to throughout a whole limb as before. He also uses it in a variety of sizes, does not shrink afterward, and is almost always hardened with Busoshoku Haki, giving it a shiny black appearance.
In Gear 4, Luffy's body proportions shift dramatically, specific to the exact form he is taking. In all forms, he gains dark rings around his eyes, and a level of Busoshoku Haki coating over at least his arms and legs that has crimson accents in addition to the typical black.
In the Boundman form, Luffy inflates himself, transforming his torso to be more spherical. He increases the size of his arms to match his torso and spreads Busoshoku Haki coating over portions of his upper chest, creating the same type of swirls as those on the Gomu Gomu no Mi. In the process of inflating, Luffy also becomes taller and more muscular.
The details of the Tankman form's regular appearance are unknown, as Luffy has only used a variation called the "Manpuku Version". In the Manpuku Version of Tankman, Luffy's body goes through a similar yet exaggerated transformation to Boundman. In this form, his torso inflates significantly more than the rest of his body, while his arms only slightly inflate. The Busoshoku Haki coating covers most of his body except for his chest, creating a flame-like pattern. He goes through a much more significant height increase, though he loses the muscular physique of Boundman to increase the roundness of his body.
In the Snakeman form, Luffy's body does not shift dramatically, remaining largely the same in terms of overall proportions. While some expansion still occurs, it's much less than in Boundman and Tankman, with the bulk of the transformation occurring in Luffy's newly flame-like hair. Compared to the other forms, he has less Busoshoku Haki spread, barely reaching his shoulders. He also gains a trail of steam and fire that drapes over his shoulders.
In Gear 5, Luffy's hair and clothes turn pure white (save for his sash and sandals). His hair takes on the appearance of a flame, and his eyes glow with large pink pupils. Like in Snakeman, he has a trail of gas draped over his shoulders, this time formed out of clouds.

Monkey D. Luffy's family, overall, is made up of some of the most influential, notorious, and powerful individuals in the world. This includes his grandfather, Monkey D. Garp, who is considered a hero within the Marines and the man who had fought Gol D. Roger, the Pirate King. His father, Monkey D. Dragon, is the head of the Revolutionary Army. His two brothers are Portgas D. Ace and Sabo, though they are not related to him by blood but are his sworn brothers through the sakazuki ceremony. Ace became the Second Division commander under the Emperor, Whitebeard, who was considered the strongest man alive, and achieved a bounty of Beli550,000,000. Sabo is the second in command of the Revolutionary Army, serving directly under Luffy's father, Dragon, and has a bounty of Beli602,000,000. His foster mother, Curly Dadan, is a bandit and the boss of the Dadan Family. The identity of Luffy's biological mother, his grandfather other than Monkey D. Garp, and either of his grandmothers are still unknown.

Monkey D. Dragon
Dragon Saves Luffy from Smoker
Dragon saves Luffy from Smoker.

Luffy has never met Dragon, despite him being his father, and for a long time did not even think he had one. He has never inquired about his father to anyone, not even his grandfather, Garp. He also had no idea about Dragon nor about his position as a criminal and the head of the Revolutionary Army and was thus left confused by everyone's, including his crew's, shock when Garp revealed to them all that Dragon is Luffy's father.[26]

Since then, Luffy has remained indifferent about Dragon's identity, and is not at all fazed by his father's reputation. He never mentions or discusses him and has never tried to locate him. The only time Luffy has taken any interest in his father was when he read that Blackbeard had attacked the base of the Revolutionary Army and got his first look at Dragon's face, commenting that he looks nothing like him.[27] He nonchalantly told Ivankov that Dragon, who Ivankov served under, was his father while the Okama was discussing his role in the Revolutionary Army.

Dragon, on the other hand, had occasionaly went to check on Luffy, watching over him from a distance and seems to keep up with his son's exploits, although this is rarely shown. He is completely accepting of Luffy's decision to become a pirate and expects great things of his son. He made an appearance in Loguetown in order to save Luffy from Smoker and as his son sailed away to the Grand Line, he shouted towards him with a smile to go forth and achieve his desires. This is the closest Dragon has ever been to meeting his son. He smiled when he heard the news of Luffy's actions at Enies Lobby, remarking to himself that Luffy should live the life he wants and that the day for them to meet will eventually come. It was noted by Ivankov that Dragon tends to stare off into the distance in the direction of East Blue, where Luffy was born, acting as some sort of homing instinct. When asked about it, Dragon casually confirmed to his men that Luffy is indeed his son, showing that he had no problem with sharing this information. He sounded somewhat grateful for Ivankov's role in protecting Luffy during the Summit War of Marineford but remarked that Luffy is not a child anymore. Dragon did express interest in Luffy's adventure in Totto Land.

Since this connection was fully revealed by Fleet Admiral Sengoku during the Summit War of Marineford, Luffy has garnered a lot of attention, both positive and negative. He has been labeled a 'dangerous future element' and has been hunted down, personally, by Admiral Akainu, as well as the World Government, who escalated their hunt for Luffy, although this is now mostly because of Luffy's own actions than his relationship with his father. Luffy also gained allies because of his connection to Dragon, such as Ivankov and Kuma, the latter of whom never revealed to Luffy he was aiding him in order to maintain his cover. His connection with Dragon has also inspired fear into some people, with members of the Marines growing wary of fighting Luffy.

Monkey D. Garp
Fist of Love
A typical moment of Garp punching Luffy.

Monkey D. Garp is a Vice Admiral, a hero of the Marines, and is Luffy's grandfather. Due to being a prideful member of the Marines, Garp had high expectations of his grandson and wished for him to become a Marine just like him. As a result, he was extremely vexed that his grandson chose to become a pirate instead, the natural enemies of the Marines, and blamed Shanks for inspiring him to become a pirate in the first place. Nonetheless, he cares deeply for his grandson and has shown to be proud of some of his achievements. Luffy loves, but also fears, his grandfather. However, the two get along quite well with each other, often laughing or scolding one another.

It is unknown how Garp came into custody of Luffy. However, it is assumed that because of the nature of Dragon's life as a revolutionary, he had passed Luffy off to Garp to be raised by him. Luffy's childhood relationship with Garp was dominated by the latter's unorthodox, and brutal, training methods, such as throwing him into valleys, leaving him alone in dangerous forests, and tying him to balloons to fly at high altitudes. He did all this with the explicit goal of making Luffy a strong Marine. Due to Garp's work, he had to give Luffy to Curly Dadan, a local mountain bandit, whilst he was away. He regularly returned to Luffy during his vacations and held training sessions with him and Ace, and at one time, with Sabo.

Due to his experiences of Garp from his childhood, Luffy has developed a fear of him whilst having also grown to love him. This was highlighted when the pair reunited in Water 7 and Luffy was immediately on the receiving end of one of Garp's punches. Such was Luffy's fear of Garp he refused to fight back and told his crew not to attempt anything either. The two are more than capable of pleasant chit-chat however, as despite the rough start to them reuniting they were happy to see each other, Garp even told Luffy about who his father was and updated him on Shanks, as well as inform him about the Four Emperors. He also promised Luffy he would not try and stop him leaving Water 7 and was willing to falsify a report to do so. However, he was later forced to renege on this promise but was happy to see he managed to escape him. The two share similarities, such as their bizarre habit of spontaneously falling asleep, as they both did so whilst Garp was scolding Luffy, shocking everyone. The Straw Hats noted that he really must be Luffy's grandfather because of the striking similarities in their personalities.

Luffy was completely ignorant of Garp's great reputation within the Marines and had no idea his own grandfather fought on an equal footing with the Pirate King, Gol D. Roger, until his crew informed him. However, Luffy shrugged it off and still sees him as just his grandfather. Due to his love for his grandfather, he was extremely reluctant to fight him during the Summit War of Marineford, despite him standing between him and Ace, but eventually gave in and punched him out of his path. Since the timeskip, Luffy has not met his grandfather but showed some curiosity in seeing him again after Chinjao mentioned him. He does not appear to hold a grudge against Garp for being indirectly involved with Ace's execution and eventual death, fully understanding that Garp's duty as a Marine made it difficult for him to act.

Although he is greatly disappointed by Luffy's decision to become a pirate, he is still pleased with how Luffy has turned out as a person. Garp was upfront about how proud he was when he heard that Luffy had outrageously infiltrated Impel Down, remarking gleefully that his grandson had done it again, annoying Fleet Admiral Sengoku. He was left in a panic when he saw Luffy falling from the sky to join the Summit War of Marineford, fearing for his well-being. He was the least surprised out of everybody that Luffy could use Haoshoku Haki, simply remarking that he did inherit it after all. Due to Garp's pride and loyalty to the Marines he accepted that he had to try and stop Luffy reaching Ace. He shouted at Luffy to be a man and take him on as that was the only way he could save his brother. As Luffy attacked him Garp's loyalty to his grandchildren won out and he allowed Luffy to strike him. He was guilt stricken by the loss of Ace and Luffy's suffering, despite trying to hide it, and took a beating from Dadan over the serious pain Luffy was going through. Since the timeskip, Garp has become more lax about his grandson's well-being, as he did not seem fazed by the news that two members of the Four Emperors, Kaidou and Big Mom, had teamed up to take down Luffy, instead just laughing it off.

Adopted and Honorary
Portgas D. Ace
Luffy And Ace Reunite
Luffy reunites with Ace in Arabasta.

Portgas D. Ace was a notorious pirate of Whitebeard's crew who was the sworn brother of Luffy and Sabo. The two shared an extremely close bond that was forged in their childhood. They first met when they were kids after Luffy was sent to Dadan by his grandfather, Garp. They grew close on their many misadventures and eventually recognized each other as brothers through the ritual drinking of sake. Luffy was fully aware that Ace's father was Gol D. Roger.

The pair got off to a bad start as Ace was hostile towards Luffy and at one point spat on him before they had been introduced. Luffy was determined to become friends with Ace, however, and persistently followed him around trying to win him over, having to overcome constant dangers forced upon him by Ace for three months. Luffy eventually won Ace over when he refused to reveal the location of Ace's treasure stash to Porchemy. Impressed, and understanding the loneliness that Luffy felt, Ace decided to become friends with him.

Throughout their childhood the pair would regularly fight to see who was stronger, with Luffy losing every time despite the advantage of having a Devil Fruit. Nonetheless, Luffy remained determined to one day defeat Ace. They swore over a bottle of sake that they are brothers and continued living their lives of misadventures throughout Foosha Village. They grew even closer after Sabo's apparent death, the devastating loss of their brother hardened their determination to become pirates and they both promised each other that once they turn 17, they would set out for sea, with Ace doing so first as he was three years older than Luffy. They would reunite in Arabasta whilst Ace was on the hunt for Blackbeard and Luffy was aiding Princess Vivi. Once he had held off Smoker for Luffy he met up with him on his ship and offered Luffy to join the Whitebeard Pirates, despite knowing he would say no. He was introduced to Luffy's crew, the Straw Hats, and Ace implicitly apologized to them for the trouble his brother causes them without needing to know the details. The two were very friendly and happy to see each other again after three years. He then chose to leave Luffy and his crew before giving him his Vivre Card so they could meet up again.

Ace cares deeply for Luffy and became angry with Blackbeard when he revealed his plan to capture Luffy and hand him over to the Marines, responding that he would not just let him do that to his brother. This protectiveness of Luffy has been a staple of his relationship since they were kids, as he would often intervene when Garp was too rough or harsh with Luffy. He grew distressed when he overheard that Luffy had made it inside Impel Down and actively tried to rush back into the elevator to head down to the level he was on but was stopped by Magellan. He was angry with Luffy when he arrived at the Summit War of Marineford because he feared that he was going to get himself killed, however, he pretended that it was a matter of his pride. Despite this, he could not help but be surprised that Luffy could use Haoshoku Haki and being joyful when Luffy had successfully freed him from his seastone handcuffs, both lamenting and praising him. He then quickly tried to flee the battlefield with Luffy. However, it would be Ace's loyalty and protectiveness that would be his downfall. Having taken the bait by Admiral Akainu, he tried to protect Whitebeard's pride and ended up having to take a direct hit from one of Akainu's attacks that was aimed at Luffy, destroying his internal organs. He collapsed into Luffy's arm and poignantly noted that he would not get to see him become the Pirate King, being certain that he would achieve this dream. But nonetheless, he died with a smile on his face after thanking Luffy for loving him when nobody else would.

On his journeys, Ace was never shy when it came to talking about Luffy. When he met Yamato in Wano, the son of Kaidou, he repeatedly brought up Luffy and even annoyed her because of it. He talked fondly of the dream Luffy had shared with both him and his other brother, Sabo, with her but demanded that she did not laugh at him like he and Sabo did. Firmly stating that whilst he can laugh, nobody else could. When Yamato affirmed, she would never laugh at him and mentioned that Luffy repeated the words of a big figure, unaware she was talking about Gol D. Roger, he became overjoyed at hearing this. After Ace joined Whitebeard's crew, he made a frequent habit of talking about Luffy, especially after he got his first wanted poster. This became so common that many of the Whitebeard pirates were already familiar with Luffy before they had actually met him. It was because of this they chose to accept him as an ally in the Summit War at Marineford and to save his life at its climax. Even Whitebeard grew an admiration for Luffy because of how joyfully Ace spoke of him.

Ace's Bloody Death in the Manga
Luffy's mind collapses from Ace's death.

Luffy greatly admired Ace and is proud of his accomplishments out at sea. His devotion to Ace is so high that he was willing to infiltrate the Marines' most notorious prison to save him, and then immediately traveled to the Summit War of Marineford to try and save him from his execution. Luffy outright refuted Ace's pleas for him to stop, shouting back at his brother that he can say whatever he likes but that he was still going to try and save him regardless. This devotion greatly impressed Whitebeard and his crew who all followed suit. When Ace ultimately died Luffy was crushed, both mentally and emotionally. The shock from losing his brother, after he risked so much to save him, sent Luffy into such a catatonic state that he was completely unable to react to his surroundings and protect himself. He almost certainly would have died at the hands of the Marines, and in particular, Akainu, if it were not for the allies, he had around him. He had to be carried off the battlefield and eventually woke up at Amazon Lily where his mental breakdown continued, not being able to fully comprehend Ace's death, and at times outright refused to believe it was true, whilst lashing out destructively at his environment. It was only thanks to Jinbe that Luffy was able to get out of this depression and continue living his dream of becoming the Pirate King, like he promised Ace so many years ago.

Since the timeskip, Luffy has rarely talked about Ace unless under certain circumstances. Whilst in Dressrosa he abandoned his original mission there in order to compete in the gladiatorial games as Ace's Devil Fruit, the Mera Mera no Mi, was the prize and did not want anyone else to have it. Whilst fighting Chinjao, Luffy was greatly angered when he mocked Ace's death and unleashed his Gomu Gomu no Thor Elephant Gun on him. When Luffy reunited with Sabo, as Sabo expressed his happiness that Luffy survived, Luffy tearfully replied that he'd let Ace die in front of him, showing he still loves Ace dearly and still blames himself for Ace's death. When he landed on Wano Country and met a young girl named Tama who had befriended Ace. She was unaware that he had died due to Wano being cut off from the rest of the world, forcing Luffy to bluntly tell her that Ace was now gone, showing he had come to terms with his passing. Luffy befriended Kaidou's son, Yamato, because of his friendship with his late brother. She informed him of how she met Ace, and they were able to bond over him.

Curly Dadan
Dadan Argues With Luffy
Dadan and Luffy arguing.

Dadan is the foster mother of Ace and Luffy and is a notorious Mountain Bandit. She was extremely reluctant to take on Luffy as she felt her hands were already full with Ace but was blackmailed by Garp to do so. Luffy disliked Mountain Bandits due to being captured by the mountain bandit, Higuma, and almost fed to a Sea King by him before Shanks saved him. Despite this, they grew to love and care for each other deeply.

She was often left flabbergasted by Luffy's attitude, as he never seemed fazed by the threats or challenges, she threw at him. Remarking that both he and Ace are too strong for her to handle. Dadan was initially cold to Luffy as she stated outright that she does not care if he were to die, leaving him out in a forest for a week. This started to change, however, as she begrudgingly got use to his presence and was willing to rescue him and Ace from the pirate captain, Bluejam. She was greatly distraught over Ace's death, but even more so for Luffy, knowing full well that his heart is in complete agony. She begged him not give in to the pain and to bounce back. She proudly declared that no matter what Luffy does, she will always be on his side.

Luffy was greatly worried for her well-being when she was defending him from Bluejam. He had grown attached to Dadan and wished for her and the rest of her family to see him off before he sets sail on his pirate journey. However, she stubbornly refused whilst trying to put on a brave face. Before leaving, Luffy told her once again that he hates Mountain Bandits, but that he likes her, causing her to burst into tears.

Dadan has been seen making a scrapbook of news articles about Luffy whilst her bandit family were wearing Straw Hats. She was overjoyed when she heard the news of Luffy defeating the Warlord, Doflamingo, and his bounty increasing, having a party with her bandit family and the rest of Foosha Village to celebrate.

Sabo
Luffy reunites with Sabo
Overjoyed by the revelation that his brother was alive after 12 years of thinking he was dead, Luffy tearfully clings to Sabo.

Like Ace, Sabo was initially annoyed with Luffy when they first met. At first, Sabo wanted to kill Luffy for discovering his and Ace's plans. However, when Luffy refused to give away the location of Ace and Sabo's treasure to Porchemy, Sabo and Ace rescued and befriended him. Like with Ace, Luffy is very close to Sabo, who had a tendency to defend or save Luffy when they were hunting together.

Sabo, Luffy, and Ace shared a drink, making them official brothers and establishing the deep bond between the three. According to Luffy, Sabo was a nicer brother to him than Ace. When Sabo's father came to take him back, Sabo willingly returned with him so that Luffy and Ace would be safe from the hired pirate Bluejam. When Sabo's apparent death was reported by Dogra, Luffy grieved by crying all night until he fell asleep. Luffy only snapped out of this sorrowful moment when Ace told him to live proudly, as Sabo wanted. Sabo's supposed death was also one of the main motivations for Luffy to become stronger.

When Sabo and Luffy were reunited after twelve whole years, Luffy did not recognize him at first and even challenged him after hearing he would not let him have Ace's Mera Mera no Mi. However, he reacted in shock upon realizing the latter's identity. Luffy quickly embraced Sabo while crying joyfully after finding out his remaining brother was alive and well.[28] Sabo thanked Luffy for surviving the Summit War of Marineford and asked for permission to eat the Mera Mera no Mi which Luffy unhesitatingly allowed.[29] When Jesus Burgess attempted to kill Luffy, Sabo quickly intercepted him and Luffy was happy to see his brother again even more so after seeing that Sabo inherited Ace's power.[30] When Sabo was preparing to leave Dressrosa, he left Luffy a Vivre Card and entrusted Luffy's safety to the Straw Hats similar to what Ace once did in the past.

After learning about the Blackbeard Pirates' attack on the Revolutionary Army's base, Luffy expressed worry for Sabo's safety and only calmed down when Pedro mentioned the possibility of Sabo being okay due to there being no mention of him being killed or captured. When further news came that Sabo allegedly killed Nefertari Cobra, Luffy absolutely refused to believe it, remaining faithful to Sabo as a freedom fighter and not a murderer due to his own childhood of being bound to his nobility.

Overview
As Luffy aims to become the Pirate King, he meets a variety of intriguing pirates who have a lasting impact on him. Some become trustworthy allies and dear friends, while others pose as formidable enemies in his search for the elusive One Piece. Luffy's unwavering determination and remarkable exploits also inspire aspiring pirates, who regard him as a role model and pledge their loyalty to him without hesitation. After the incident at Enies Lobby, Smoker pointed out that the Straw Hats' actions would motivate pirates around the world to become more daring, during the Return to Sabaody Arc, It was discovered that Luffy had become such an infamous pirate that Demaro Black and the Fake Straw Hat Crew were able to take advantage of Luffy's and the real Straw Hats' infamy to achieve their own fame, prestige, power and influence, as a testament to this, they managed to recruit several infamous pirates, including Supernovas. At the end of the Dressrosa Arc, seven powerful pirate crews swore eternal loyalty to Luffy because he had earned their respect and admiration thanks to his strength and charisma.

Straw Hat Grand Fleet
Straw Hat Grand Fleet
The seven representatives swear loyalty to Luffy.

The Straw Hat Grand Fleet are a group of pirate crews who's captains have pledged their allegiance to Monkey D. Luffy under his crew's name, and were formed at the end of the Dressrosa Arc. They are made up of seven pirate crews, the Beautiful Pirates, Barto Club, Happo Navy, Ideo Pirates, Tonta Corps, the reborn Giant Warrior Pirates and the Yonta Maria Grand Fleet.

Throughout the events of Dressrosa, the various captains had gained a lot of respect for Luffy and his crew, and desired to serve under him. Luffy bluntly stated that he had no desire for such a large fleet, but the captains resolved this issue by declaring their allegiance to Luffy among themselves. Luffy was still annoyed but ultimately acknowledged them as his friends and will help them whenever they need it. With all the parties happy with this outcome they exchanged Vivre Cards and went their separate ways.

After Luffy had successfully infiltrated and escaped Big Mom's territory a grand catalog of Luffy was made by the press which included the details of the Straw Hat Grand Fleet. Luffy's fleet, that gives the Straw Hat captain a cumulative bounty of Beli4,183,000,100, contributed significantly to him being labelled as the "fifth emperor" of the seas by "Big News" Morgans and the World Economy News Paper.[26]

Cavendish
Cavendish And Luffy Talking
Cavendish explaining to Luffy that he will take down Doflamingo for him.

Cavendish is the captain of the Beautiful Pirates and is the First Captain of the Straw Hat Grand Fleet. Originally, Cavendish despised Luffy as he was part of the Worst Generation that gathered so much attention away from him. However, after the events of the Dressrosa Arc, he came to respect Luffy to the point of becoming the head of his Grand Fleet. Cavendish admires Luffy but is annoyed by him because of his apathetic attitude towards him. Luffy respects Cavendish but is irritated by his vanity and the way he talks down to him, nonetheless, they see each other as dependable allies and friends.

He fell for Luffy's "Lucy" disguise whilst competing in the gladiatorial games and was initially friendly and sociable to him. Once he discovered that Lucy was in fact Luffy he became immediately hostile and violent, with Luffy having to be saved by Rebecca to get away from his blood lust. His hatred of Luffy is great and he was annoyed at how much the crowd loved Luffy after his victory against Chinjao. He later made an attempt at killing Luffy after the match, though Luffy was able to escape him.[27] However, when Cavendish lost his gladiatorial match and was sent to the basement of the Colosseum where he was turned into a toy, he saw Usopp and, after hearing he was part of the Straw Hats, he silently promised himself that he would cease all hostilities towards Luffy if Usopp saves him.[28] Thanks to Usopp, he was reverted back to his human form and stuck by his promise. He thus offered his aid to the Straw Hat captain as a means to repay his debt.[29] Such was his determination to pay his debt back, he offered to personally take down Donquixote Doflamingo for Luffy.

Throughout the Dressrosa Arc he proved to be a very useful ally for Luffy, as he carried him and Law on the back of his horse, Farul, when the Straw Hat captain was on his way to confront Doflamingo. He took on two members of the Donquixote Pirates, Gladius and Dellinger, the latter he defeated in his Hakuba personality. He was more than willing to fight Doflamingo on Luffy's behalf and became irritated when Luffy would not allow him to do so. He defended Luffy's friends from Doflamingo and was more than prepared to go fight him but accepted Luffy's request to escort his friends to safety under the incorrect assumption that Luffy was his fan.[30] Alongside the various allies Luffy had made in Dressrosa, Cavendish chose to stand against the Admiral Fujitora until Luffy had arrived to leave the kingdom. He still believed Luffy was his fan by the end of the Dressrosa Arc but had come to respect him enough to announce his fealty towards the Straw Hat captain.[31] It was Cavendish that revealed to the press the details of Luffy's Grand Fleet.

Cavendish was amazed by Luffy's abilities, although initially not wanting to admit it. He was stunned to see him knock out Hajrudin, a giant, with a single punch and was even more amazed when he unleashed his Haoshoku Haki when he clashed with Chinjao. When he saw Luffy dominate Doflamingo in his Gear 4 form he was astounded and complimented Luffy, stating he is unbelievable. He was so impressed by Luffy that he desired to serve under him as part of his fleet but was irritated when Luffy refused to accept him along with the others, but ultimately used Luffy's own logic against him and successfully formed the Grand Fleet in the Straw Hat captain's name.

Luffy was initially annoyed by Cavendish and his constant pursuit of him. Although he defended Rebecca from the crowd's vicious jeers against her, something Luffy respected him for, he still did not like him.[32] However, once he realized Cavendish no longer bore any ill will towards him, he became much more comfortable and friendlier around him, although still annoyed by his vanity. Regardless, Luffy sees Cavendish as a strong fighter and someone he can rely upon should he ever need his help. He trusted Cavendish's abilities enough to ask him to protect his friends and help them get away from Doflamingo. Although Luffy considers Cavendish to be a friend, he still did not wish to have him follow him and his crew across the seas. Luffy tends to annoy Cavendish as he regularly calls him "Cabbage" instead of his actual name.

Bartolomeo
Luffy Praises Bartolomeo's Abilities
Bartolomeo grins happily after Luffy praises him.

Bartolomeo is the captain of the Barto Club and the second captain of the Straw Hat Grand Fleet. He is a major fan of Luffy and has extreme admiration for the Straw Hat captain. Such is his admiration that he struggles to maintain his composure in his presence and has shown his willingness to die for him.

He first came across Luffy all the way back in Loguetown when he became awe struck after witnessing Luffy survive Buggy's execution attempt atop Gol D. Roger's execution platform thanks to a stray lightning bolt. He became immediately enamored by him because of this spectacle and followed Luffy and his crew's adventure with a great passion. After the Summit War of Marineford he gave up his life as a Mafia boss to become a pirate. He traveled to Dressrosa with the intent of winning the Mera Mera no Mi, as he was well aware it belonged to Luffy's brother, Ace, and wished to give it to him as a memento. It was here that he finally met Luffy after overhearing Bellamy call "Lucy" by his epithet, Straw Hat.

Throughout the Dressrosa Arc, Bartolomeo was passionately determined to aid Luffy and his crew in any way he could. He led Luffy to Zoro and Kin'emon when the two needed to talk to Luffy, and he protected him from Cavendish's attempts to kill him. Whilst he worked with Luffy and the Straw Hats to take down Doflamingo, he aided Rebecca and Robin when they tried to take the key to Law's handcuffs to Luffy, produced a flight of stairs to provide a shortcut for Luffy to get to Doflamingo, and protected him from Gladius' attacks with his own body. He was enthusiastic about forming the Straw Hat Grand Fleet and was initially disappointed by Luffy's refusal, but respected him even more after hearing his explanation about not wanting fame, but just freedom. This led to him, and the others, to form the Grand Fleet anyway out of their own freedom. He then provided transportation for Luffy, Zoro, Usopp, Franky and Robin to get to the rest of their crew in Zou.

His admiration of Luffy goes to extreme lengths and he has openly stated that he would die for him, earning Robin's acknowledgement. He faints when looking at him and fails to make eye contact with him as a result, often crying profusely when Luffy thanks him and blushing from any kind of acknowledgement Luffy gives him and became overly excited when Luffy said his actual name for the first time. Although he is normally aggressive and cruel to everyone else, he comes in contact with, when it comes to Luffy and his crew he cannot help but be overtly kind, defensive, and sincere to all of them. He does not tolerate anyone insulting, or even back talking, Luffy, and at one point he cut off a man's tongue for mocking Luffy's failure to protect his brother. He chastised Rebecca for not being more respectful in front of the Straw Hat captain, and almost went into a fight against Sabo for how he talked to Luffy, not realizing who he was at the time. He looks up to Luffy and seems him as a great inspiration and refers to him as "senpai", showing his great respect for him.

Bartolomeo is constantly amazed by Luffy's abilities and gets excited whenever he does an attack in front of him. He was left completely stunned when Luffy chose to attack the Admiral Fujitora as everyone was making their escape from Dressrosa. His inspiration for his attacks are sometimes based on Luffy's own attacks, such as his finishing move on Gladius which he named "Bari Bari no Pistol", based on Luffy's "Gomu Gomu no Pistol". He admires Luffy's strength to such an extent that he sees himself as greatly inferior to him, and thus promises that he will become strong enough to be of use to the Straw Hat captain one day. He is also a firm believer that Luffy will become the next Pirate King.

Luffy did not interact much with Bartolomeo throughout the Dressrosa Arc and didn't seem to notice Bartolomeo's obsession with him, but he praised him numerous times for his aid and eventually acknowledged him as a friend, seeing him as a capable ally. He finds his Devil Fruit abilities impressive and complimented Bartolomeo when he created stairs for him as a shortcut to Doflamingo. He was also intrigued by Bartolomeo's ship, the Going Luffy-senpai, as it takes on a lot of features of the Going Merry whilst using Luffy's likeness as the ship's figurehead. Luffy has given Bartolomeo the nickname "rooster head", something Bartolomeo does not mind. However, after he delivered Luffy to the Thousand Sunny outside of Zou he finally called Bartolomeo by his actual name, causing him to become overjoyed.

Sai
Aggressive Sai
Sai becoming aggressive after Luffy thanks him.

Sai is the current, and 13th, leader of the Happo Navy, the third captain of the Straw Hat Grand Fleet, and the grandson of the notorious pirate, Chinjao. The two are allies and friends, but initially Sai somewhat disliked Luffy because of his relations to Monkey D. Garp who had fought his grandfather and flattened his pointy head. However, by the end of the Dressrosa Arc this was no longer an issue and they now share a positive relationship.

The two first met after Luffy had defeated Spartan and was about to be disqualified until Sai, who had witnessed the incident, defended Luffy and informed the official that it was Spartan who started the fight. Luffy thanked Sai but he soon became aggressive, demanding Luffy that he take back the apology and had to be restrained by his brother when he became violent. He next appeared alongside his grandfather, Chinjao, who went after Luffy, seeing through his Lucy disguise, and tried to kill him whilst Sai held him back. He was placed in the same match as Luffy, as well as his grandfather, and was defeated by the Straw Hat captain. After the match, he, along with Chinjao, ceased any hostilities towards Luffy after he fixed his grandfather's pointy head.

Initially, he indulged his grandfather's hatred towards Luffy as he was perfectly fine with his desire to kill the Straw Hat captain and only restrained him because it would potentially compromise their true mission, telling his grandfather that he can just kill him during their match. After the match he held no grudge for his defeat and he brought Chinjao to Luffy so his grandfather could thank the Straw Hat captain for fixing his head. He then became an ally to Luffy and his crew after he was saved by Usopp, a member of the Straw Hats. Once he found Luffy again he declared that he would defeat Doflamingo for him as a way to pay back his debt. Throughout the events of Dressrosa, Sai worked to defeat members of the Donquixote Pirates and to support Luffy in his quest to defeat Doflamingo. Following Dressrosa he chose to become a subordinate of Luffy's and join the Straw Hat Grand Fleet, but like everybody else, was left stunned by Luffy's initial refusal.

Luffy does not think much of Sai due to their limited interactions. He was thankful for coming to his aid and explain his innocence after defeating Spartan, but was left shocked by his sudden turn of aggression towards him. He was also annoyed by his insistence to defeat Doflamingo for him and competed with him to see who could reach Doflamingo first. By the end of the Dressrosa Arc he had come to see Sai as an ally and friend, although was still irritated by the formation of the Grand Fleet. Nonetheless he shared his Vivre Card with Sai before they went their separate ways.

Ideo
Ideo Shocked By Luffy's Power
Ideo amazed by Luffy's power against Pica.

Ideo is a XXX rank boxer, a member of the Longarm Tribe, the captain of the newly formed Ideo Pirates and the fourth captain of the Straw Hat Grand Fleet. The two have scarcely interacted and thus their relationship is not fleshed out, however, they have come to recognize each other as allies, having worked together to defeat Doflamingo and end his reign over Dressrosa. He is also a representative of the XXX Gym Martial Arts Alliance in Luffy's Grand Fleet.

They were opponents in the same match during the gladiatorial games in the Corrida Colosseum. Having lost the match after being defeated by Chinjao, he was sent to the basement of the Colosseum and turned into a toy. He was soon rescued by Usopp who he discovered was a member of the Straw Hats and because of this he decided to aid Luffy in his fight against Doflamingo.

Ideo was a very helpful ally to Luffy throughout the Dressrosa Arc. He defended Luffy when some toys came after the Straw Hat captain, working with some of the other Colosseum fighters to fend them off. He worked with the Colosseum fighters again to hold off members of the Donquixote Pirates whilst Luffy and Cavendish made their way towards Doflamingo. Following Luffy's victory, he and some of the other fighters subdued the Marines at the port that they intend to sail out of with Luffy.

He is surprised, and sometimes annoyed, at Luffy's abilities and brazen attitude. After being thrown out of the ring he watched in awe as Luffy clashed his Haoshoku Haki with Chinjao's. He was stunned when he saw Luffy and his group riding up Pica's arm and was left even more amazed when he shattered Pica's stone head with his Grizzly Magnum. He was irritated by Luffy's refusal to drink the cup of sake in order to confirm the Grand Fleet that would be formed under the Straw Hat captain, and even proposed forcing Luffy to drink it. However, he understood Luffy's reasoning and used his logic to form the Grand Fleet with the other captains anyway.

Luffy has not been seen interacting with Ideo on any particular basis. However, he was annoyed with Ideo when he tried to compete with him to take down Doflamingo. By the end of the Arc he accepted Ideo as a friend, being grateful for his aid in defeating Doflamingo, and professed that he would come to aid him, and the others, should they need his help, but did not wish to have him form a Grand Fleet in his name. Nonetheless, despite him having formed the Grand Fleet with the other captains, he gave him his Vivre Card before they parted ways.

Leo
Leo Ready To Drink His Cup of Sake
Leo about to drink his cup of Sake to form the Straw Hat Grand Fleet.

Leo is a dwarf from the Tontatta Kingdom, the leader of the Tontatta Pirates and the fifth captain of the Straw Hat Grand Fleet. He did not directly work with Luffy throughout the Dressrosa Arc, but instead worked with Usopp, Nico Robin and Franky to loosen Doflamingo's grip on Dressrosa. Despite this, he came to admire Luffy greatly for defeating Doflamingo and ending his tyranny, though he still refers to Luffy as "Luffyland" (due to Usopp's influence).

Although he never directly interacted with Luffy, he proved to be a helpful ally. He indirectly aided him by providing transport for Robin, Rebecca and Bartolomeo to deliver the keys to Trafalgar Law's seastone handcuffs. He also reattached Law's arm after Luffy had entrusted him into his, and the other's, care. After hearing an explosion on the palace roof, he wished to aid Luffy but was told by Robin and Kyros that they would just get in Luffy's way.

He was thankful for what Luffy did for him and his kingdom, as well as Dressrosa. Particularly for allowing his crew members to aid him and his kingdom to save the princess, Mansherry, and undo the affects of Sugar's Devil Fruit abilities. He cried into Robin's chest after hearing from Gatz that Luffy was victorious against Doflamingo. Such was his joy he worked to build statues of Luffy, as well as Usopp and Kyros, to celebrate what they had done. Following the defeat of Doflamingo he requested permission from his king, Gancho, to join the others in forming the Straw Hat Grand Fleet. When Luffy was fighting the Admiral Fujitora he commanded his troops to aid him. He was initially annoyed at Luffy's refusal to form the Grand Fleet, but understood his reasoning and ultimately formed the Grand Fleet anyway. He traveled with Rebecca to the Levely and befriend Nefertari Vivi and Shirahoshi through their shared admiration of Luffy. This reason alone was enough for him to attempt to attack a World Noble who was trying to enslave Shirahoshi.

Luffy has rarely been seen interacting with Leo, but still acknowledged him as an ally and friend. He professed that he would come and aid him, as well as the others, if they ever needed his help, and recognized the help he provided during his fight against Doflamingo. Despite being irritated that he, along with the other captains, formed the Grand Fleet anyway, he still exchanged Vivre Cards with Leo so that they could come and aid each other.

Hajrudin
Luffy Defeats Hajrudin
Luffy defeating Hajrudin in their first encounter.

Hajrudin is a giant warrior from Elbaf, the captain of the reformed New Giant Warrior Pirates and the sixth captain of the Straw Hat Grand Fleet. Despite getting off to a bad start during the gladiatorial games after they fought each other in their respective match, he proved to be a useful ally for Luffy throughout the Dressrosa Arc in order to take down Doflamingo. They have both come to respect each other as allies, friends and warriors.

The two met during their match in the Corrida Colosseum when Hajrudin crushed Luffy and the Fighting Bull who he had befriended, because of this, Luffy angrily punched Hajrudin, defeating him instantly. After being defeated he was sent to the basement of the Colosseum where he was turned into a toy. He was then saved by Usopp when the Straw Hat sniper was able to nullify Sugar's Devil Fruit abilities, turning Hajrudin, and everybody else, back to normal. From then on, he allied with Luffy to defeat Doflamingo.

Despite being opponents in the match, he did not harbor any particular dislike for Luffy, seeing him simply as an opponent he needs to defeat and did not hold a grudge towards the Straw Hat captain for defeating him. Hajrudin is responsible for helping Luffy gain so many allies during his fight with Doflamingo as he was the one that made sure everybody knew it was Usopp, a member of the Straw Hats, that saved them. He promised Luffy on his pride as a warrior of Elbaf that he would defeat Doflamingo for him.

Throughout the Dressrosa Arc, Hajrudin aided Luffy numerous times. He held off a number of toys that were after Luffy alongside the other fighters. He fought off members of the Donquixote Pirates in order to allow Luffy and Cavendish to go on ahead to face Doflamingo. He was prepared to stand his ground against the Marines and the Admiral Fujitora until Luffy had arrived to leave the kingdom. Whilst escaping from Dressrosa, he caught Luffy and forcibly took him away from his fight with Fujitora so they could successfully escape, even keeping hold of him in fear he would continue trying to fight the Admiral. He is determined to continue aiding Luffy and has set out to reform the Giant Warrior Pirates for his sake.

He has come to respect Luffy and acknowledged his abilities as a fighter. He was willing to forget about his defeat to the Straw Hat captain in order to aid him. He was stunned to see Luffy was charging up Pica's arm and was left speechless when he used his Grizzly Magnum to destroy his stone head. Nonetheless, he was still greatly annoyed by Luffy's decision not to drink the cup of sake to form the Straw Hat Grand Fleet but understood his reasons why, and used this reason to form the alliance anyway, along with the other captains.

Luffy did not take kindly what Hajrudin did to Ucy who he had made friends with and knocked him out with a powerful punch for it. However, by the time they reunited Luffy had seemingly dropped any ill-will he had towards the giant. He was appreciative of him for his aid and found him helpful as an ally whilst trying to reach Doflamingo. He still became irritated with Hajrudin for making him leave his fight with Fujitora prematurely. By the end of the Arc, he considers Hajrudin a friend and swore to come to his, and the other's, aid should they ever need it. He still exchanged Vivre Cards with Hajrudin even though he was annoyed that he and the other captains formed the Straw Hat Grand Fleet despite not wanting them to.

Orlumbus
Formation Of Straw Hat Grand Fleet
Orlumbus present during the formation of the Straw Hat Grand Fleet.

Orlumbus is the Admiral of the Yonta Maria Grand Fleet and the seventh captain of the Straw Hat Grand Fleet who met Luffy during the Dressrosa Arc. The two did not interact very often but he became a determined ally for Luffy in his quest to take down Doflamingo. Luffy acknowledges his efforts and sees him as a friend and ally.

Following his lost during the gladiatorial games he was sent to the basement of the Corrida Colosseum where he was transformed into a toy. He was saved by Usopp after the Straw Hat sniper managed to nullify Sugar's Devil Fruit abilities and allied with Luffy and his crew.

He protected Luffy and his friends when some toys came for them, fighting them all off alongside the other Colosseum fighters. He then worked with the other Colosseum fighters to provide an opening for Luffy and Cavendish to reach Doflamingo. He was crucial for Luffy's, and everybody else's, escape from Dressrosa as he provided 56 ships to cover their escape and had them board his flagship, the Yonta Maria.

Orlumbus is greatly impressed by Luffy's abilities and determination, whilst also being irritated by his refusal of the Straw Hat Grand Fleet. He was amazed to see him riding up Pica's arm and was left speechless when the Straw Hat captain destroyed Pica's stone head. When Luffy refused to form the Straw Hat Grand Fleet he seemed to take personal offence that his fleet of 4,300 men was not enough power for Luffy. However, after hearing Luffy's reasoning he understood what the Straw Hat captain meant and chose to form the Grand Fleet with the other captains anyway.

Luffy was annoyed by Orlumbus' determination to take down Doflamingo, as he wished to do so himself. Nonetheless, by the end of the Dressrosa Arc he has come to see Orlumbus as a valuable ally and recognized his efforts in freeing Dressrosa from the Warlord of the Sea. He promised Orlumbus, as well as the other captains, that he will come to their aid should they ever need it. Despite being annoyed that they formed the Grand Fleet anyway, he exchanged Vivre Cards with him and went their separate ways.

Worst Generation
Trafalgar D. Water Law
Law And Luffy On Their Way to Dressrosa
Luffy and Law sitting side by side.

The captain of the Heart Pirates, Trafalgar Law is a former Warlord of the Sea and Luffy's most prominent ally since the time skip. They first met on Sabaody Archipelago and briefly became acquainted. They met again on Punk Hazard where Law formed an alliance with Luffy to take down the Emperor Kaidou.[33] Despite their opposing views on what an alliance is meant to be, their relationship is positive. Law puts up with Luffy's antics and begrudgingly respects him. Luffy, himself, is very fond of Law and is overtly casual with him despite his serious demeanor.

The two met on Sabaody Archipelago inside the Human Auction House when Law witnessed Luffy punch the Celestial Dragon, Charlos. He smiled at Luffy's defiance towards the World Noble and fought alongside him, as well as Eustass Kid, when the Marines surrounded the auction house. Following this, the two went their separate ways. Law was the one to save Luffy at the end of the Battle of Marineford and operated on the Straw Hat captain to save his life. He then left Luffy in the company of Jinbe and Silvers Rayleigh before Luffy could thank him. Following the time skip, Luffy met Law again on Punk Hazard after the now Warlord of the Sea saved Luffy and Nami from the Yeti Cool Brothers. He formerly requested an alliance with the Straw Hat captain to take down the emperor, Kaidou. Luffy agreed and together, with the help of others, including their fellow Worst Generation member, Kid, successfully took down both Kaidou and Big Mom.

Despite his outward stoic demeanor and apathetic attitude towards Luffy, Law does seem to like him. He also seems to accept following Luffy's lead when it comes to carrying out their plans and tolerates the Straw Hat captain taking the initiative in a lot of situations, even if it can annoy him from time to time. His first impressions of Luffy were positive as he smiled when he punched a Celestial Dragon. He decided to brave the attacks of the Marines and the Admirals to rescue Luffy and Jinbe when they tried to escape the Summit War of Marineford, before he then saved his life by tending to his wounds. Although he admitted that it would have been a shame if Luffy had died at Marineford, he tried to claim to Luffy that he only helped him on a whim. He later saved Luffy as he fell from the sky after he defeated Donquixote Doflamingo and attempted to save Luffy's life again after the Straw Hat captain was defeated by Kaidou but was stopped by Basil Hawkins. During the Dressrosa Arc, he stated that if Luffy were to die at the hands of Doflamingo he would be prepared to die along with him, as he felt a sense of guilt for dragging Luffy into a battle that was outside their original agreement. He also stood alongside Luffy when they faced against Kaidou and Big Mom during the Raid on Onigashima.

He has come to respect Luffy enough that he tolerates some of his decisions. He agreed to aid him in rescuing the children from Punk Hazard, despite seeing them as a burden, and accepted Luffy's decision to retrieve Sanji from the Big Mom Pirates despite neither having anything to do with their plans, and the latter would in fact make their alliance much more complicated if they were to anger another emperor. He appeared to be grateful, as well as amazed, when Luffy defeated Doflamingo, who Law had hated since he was a child after he killed Donquixote Rosinante, a very close friend of his. When it came to facing Kaidou, Law chose to fight by his side again, like they had done against Doflamingo. The two proved to be effective at times in their battle, albeit Law was still annoyed when Luffy ordered him around. He is ultimately not above being childishly competitive with Luffy, as well as Kid, as all three of them made a bet to see who would be the last to move against Big Mom's attack.

Nonetheless, Law often feels frustrated by Luffy's carefree and reckless attitude. He laments his misunderstanding of what an alliance is supposed to be but he still has plenty of faith in his abilities and trusts him to complete his tasks. He was greatly annoyed when Luffy charged in to attack Caesar Clown as the original plan was to capture him quietly. However, he later bragged to Doflamingo with great confidence that Luffy would capture Caesar. He was irritated when Luffy sent Caesar flying away and admitted that he regrets their alliance, but was pleased to see his crew had actually captured Caesar. At one point, he tried to nullify their alliance when their plan to have Kaidou attack Doflamingo was no longer possible, but he was rebuffed by Luffy. When Law was at Doflamingo's mercy he chose not to give the Seven Warlords of the Sea what he wanted and berated Doflamingo for underestimating Luffy and the Straw Hats, warning him that he would lose his fight against them as they are capable of performing miracles.[34] At one point, he reflects on his alliance with Luffy and comments to Smoker that although he intended to use Luffy for his own means he feels like he is the one who is being used. When Luffy formed the Ninja-Pirate-Mink-Samurai Alliance he was briefly annoyed that Luffy had not consulted him first but ultimately had no objections. When the two are reunited in Wano he is immediately annoyed after Luffy and Zoro attracted too much attention, compromised Kin'emon's plans and eventually led Kaidou to their location. When Luffy believed Kaidou had potentially killed his crew Law tried to stop him from attacking the emperor, but this was in vain. Annoyed, he was forced to watch as Luffy hopelessly fought against Kaidou.

Luffy treats Law as one of his closest friends and likes him a lot. Due to his lack of understanding of what an alliance is supposed to be, and being oblivious to Law's attitude around him, he ends up dragging Law into a lot of his chaotic situations. He was very happy to see Law again on Punk Hazard and thanked him for saving his life following the Summit War of Marineford.[35] Even though he does not know Law that well, he implicitly trusts him and was more than willing to make an alliance with him as soon as he offered. When challenged by Robin if he could trust him, Luffy simply asked Law if he was going to betray them and believed him immediately when he said he would not. He is very protective of Law and was determined to rescue him when he had been captured by Doflamingo,[36] and became extremely angry when he believed Doflamingo had killed him.[37] He carried Law up towards the Flower Field in order to get the key to his seastone handcuffs so he could be freed. He did not accept Law's attempt to end the alliance after their plan had been compromised whilst in Dressrosa, stating that he cannot decide that for both of them. Although from the outset he intends to follow Law's plans, as he trusts him enough, he ultimately ends up disregarding it and relying on his improvisation instead.

It also seems like Luffy cannot pronounce "Trafalgar" properly and calls him "Tora-o" (トラ男, Tora-o?) instead, a portmanteau of the "Tra" in "Trafalgar" and the Japanese kanji for "male". It is often localized as "Tra-guy" in some subs or as "Traffy" in Pirate Warriors 3.[38] Despite being allies, they still see each other as rivals for One Piece.

Eustass Kid
Luffy And Eustass Kid
Luffy and Eustass Kid whilst in the Prisoner Mine.

The captain of the Kid Pirates, Eustass Kid is a rival to Luffy's dream of becoming the Pirate King. In spite of their rivalry, Kid has a degree of respect and admiration for Luffy because of his infamous reputation of causing chaos wherever he goes. On the other hand, Luffy had not heard of Kid until he arrived on Sabaody Archipelago, but got on with him pretty well when he first met him and acknowledged him as a rival. The two have cemented a competitive relationship since they reunited on Wano.

The two first met on Sabaody Archipelago where both were seen as members of the Worst Generation.[39] Kid was greatly excited when he heard that Straw Hat Luffy was on Sabaody and was eager to see him do something crazy. He got his wish as he witnessed Luffy crash land into the Human Auctioning House and deliver a devastating punch to the World Noble, Charlos, something that not even he was expecting him to do.[40] In the ensuing chaos, he decided to work with Luffy, as well as Trafalgar Law, to fight off the Marines before going their separate ways.[41] The pair reunited two years later in Wano after both Kid and Luffy were captured by the emperor, Kaidou.[42] Despite their disagreements, they ultimately formed an alliance to take down Kaidou, with Kid joining Luffy and Trafalgar Law in the Raid on Onigashima.[43]

Although their personalities are opposites of one another, Kid has a certain amount of respect for the Straw Hat captain and is impressed by his numerous feats and his well documented craziness.[44] He praised Luffy for being the only Supernova brave enough to take part in the Summit War of Marineford and believed (incorrectly) that Luffy ringing the Ox Bell on his return to Marineford was his declaration of a new age that he will forge himself.[45] Ultimately, however, he sees Luffy as his rival first and foremost, and states he will not let him do as he pleases. During the incident on Sabaody, Kid was caught off guard by Luffy nonchalantly claiming he will be the one to find One Piece,[46] remarking to himself that those who say something like that would normally get laughed at, but understood that they had to stake their claim if they want to survive in the New World. Kid thus acknowledged Luffy's determination and promised to meet up with him and Law in the New World.[47]

When he reunited with Luffy in Kaidou's prison, he could not help but show his competitive side with the Straw Hat captain, often arguing with him on who would be the one to take down Kaidou and who did the most work.[48] Nonetheless, he willingly worked with Luffy to defeat the deputy warden, Dobon, and even listened to his command to not attack first.[49] Despite his begrudging respect for Luffy, he rejected his offer of an alliance, not out of any animosity towards him, but because of his bitterness after being betrayed in his last alliance with Basil Hawkins and Scratchmen Apoo.[50] Nonetheless, he reneges on this decision and joins Luffy in his fight against Kaidou.[51] The two would fight side by side against Kaidou at the top of Onigashima and would still show their overt competitiveness with each other.[52] Despite wanting to defeat Kaidou, Kid made the decision to fight Big Mom, alongside his crew mate, Killer, as a means to keep the emperors separated.[53] Following their victory, Kid's competitive nature still came through, as he was furious that Luffy was named an Emperor and he was not. Such was his annoyance, he even tried to attack Luffy during the celebrations, but the Straw Hat captain wrapped his arm around to continue singing and laughing, much to his chigrin.[54]

Luffy does not necessarily think much of Kid as he does not pay attention to the people in his generation, but still recognizes him as his rival and believes he is a strong fighter. Luffy was intrigued by Kid's Devil Fruit and commented that his power is weird, with Kid retorting that Luffy's Devil Fruit was the weirdest.[55] Luffy met Kid again whilst in Kaidou's prison and argued with him on who would defeat Kaidou and who did the most work.[56] He still was able to work with him to defeat the deputy warden, Dobon, and showed deep concern when Queen threatened to drown Kid.[57] By the time they escaped he had come to like Kid enough to request an alliance, but this was rejected.[58] Luffy was still happy to have him as an ally, when he changed his mind, and fought alongside him against Kaidou[59] before Kid chose to go after Big Mom whilst Luffy is left to fight Kaidou on his own.[60] Both of them completed their tasks, as Luffy defeated Kaidou[61] and Kid defeated Big Mom along with Trafalgar Law.[62]

Luffy refers to Kid by the nickname "Giza-o" (ギザ男, English versions: Jaggy?), referencing Kid's spiky hair.[63] Giza comes from giza giza (ぎざぎざ?), which is an onomatopoeic word that indicates something having serrated or jagged edges.

Capone Bege
Straw Hats and Fire Tanks Part Ways
Bege parting ways with Luffy and his group.

The captain of the Fire Tank Pirates and a former ally of the Big Mom Pirates, Capone Bege was originally an antagonist to Luffy but chose to ally himself with the Straw Hats once he realized their goals against Big Mom were aligned. He proved to be a helpful ally to Luffy and his crew throughout the Whole Cake Island Arc. Bege found the Straw Hat captain to be a reckless and an exhausting person but grew to respect him. Luffy did not like Bege for his actions against him and his friends, but grew to like him nonetheless.

Bege first met Luffy on Sabaody Archipelago when he became extremely annoyed with the Straw Hat captain after he punched a World Noble and brought the wrath of Admiral Kizaru onto the island. Following the time-skip, he made an enemy out of Luffy and the Straw Hats when, as a member of the Big Mom Pirates, he traveled to Zou in order to take Sanji away to be married. Having succeeded, Luffy became angry with his actions and chose to infiltrate Big Mom's territory to recover his crewmate. He found himself begrudgingly agreeing to ally with Bege, due to Jinbe's insistence, once it was revealed he intended to assassinate Big Mom.

Through this alliance their relationship greatly improved. Bege became sympathetic towards the Straw Hats, especially because his wife, Charlotte Chiffon, felt indebted to them for helping her sister back on Thriller Bark. As a result, he became a valuable ally during the Whole Cake Island Arc, at varying points protecting them and refusing to give them up to the emperor or her crew. The two parted on good terms after he aided Luffy and the Straw Hats' escape from Whole Cake Chateau, although he continued to aid the Straw Hats with his own escape from Big Mom's territory.[64]

Luffy initially disliked Bege because of his former life as a Mafia don and for trying to kill Pekoms, someone who Luffy considered a friend. Despite this, at the behest of Jinbe, he agreed to meet with Bege to discuss forming an alliance since Bege wished to assassinate Big Mom and was willing to help the Straw Hats escape with Sanji. The two got into a heated argument during negotiations, and at one point Luffy tried to punch him, but the two were able to set their differences aside and agreed to work together. Luffy began to soften up to Bege and he was very concerned for him when he was being attacked by Big Mom whilst protecting him and his crew in his Big Father form and tried to help him. Luffy found his Devil Fruit abilities amazing and was left star struck when he saw his tank form just before they parted.

Despite getting off to a bad start with Luffy on Sabaody, he stayed loyal to him as an ally. Bege refused to turn on Luffy despite being ordered to do so by Charlotte Katakuri, as despite his disreputable past, he still believed in honoring his deals. He then tried to hold off the Sweet Commander so that Luffy could continue their plan. He provided shelter for Luffy and his crew with his Big Father form and took the onslaught of Big Mom's attacks in order to protect everyone inside. Like most people, he can be irritated by Luffy's recklessness, as he was stunned when Luffy openly revealed his presence to Big Mom, jeopardizing their plan.[65] After risking his life to keep Big Mom at bay, Bege said that he would not forgive the Straw Hats if they were to die.[66] He was annoyed when Luffy was falsely credited with being the mastermind behind the plot to assassinate Big Mom.

X Drake
X Drake is a Marine soldier undercover as a pirate and the captain of both the Marine unit, SWORD, and the Drake Pirates. After infiltrating the Tobiroppo of the Beasts Pirates, Drake chose to ally himself with Luffy and the Ninja-Pirate-Mink-Samurai Alliance during the Raid on Onigashima once his treachery was uncovered. Whilst not familiar with Luffy, he had heard positive things from his fellow Marine, Koby, and thus decided to take a chance on the Straw Hat captain.

As a member of the Worst Generation, Drake first came across Luffy on Sabaody Archipelago.[67] He did not directly interact with him, but was forced to fight the Admiral, Kizaru, when Luffy assaulted a World Noble.[68] He would not cross paths with Luffy until Wano, by which point he had become a subordinate for Kaidou.[69] His views on Luffy are largely influenced by his colleague, Koby, who lavished praise on the Straw Hat captain.[70] He was particularly intrigued by Koby's suggestion that Luffy has a way of pulling people towards him.[71] This led him, During the Raid on Onigashima and in a desperate situation after his cover is blown, to ally with the Straw Hat captain to take down the Beast Pirates.[72] It is clear that Drake holds a degree of respect towards Luffy, as he vowed to repay him by taking down Scratchmen Apoo.[73] He also tried to take out a CP0 agent after he overheard orders given to him to kill Luffy, commenting that his justice tells him he must prevent this from happening.[74]

Luffy is largely ignorant X-Drake. He is not familiar with most of the Worst Generation, and was even a bit flabbergasted when Drake offered an alliance, since he was an apparent member of the Beast Pirates.[75] However, Luffy decided to accept him as an ally, almost on a whim. His reasoning is not clear, and even went against the views of his own crew mates. Although, Luffy did comment to Drake that he knows him, implying that he might have some knowledge of his status as a member of the Worst Generation.[76]

Jewelry Bonney
Luffy, Chopper and Bonney Eating
Luffy, Bonney and Chopper chow down together.

Jewelry Bonney is the captain of the Bonney Pirates. Although they did not interact before the timeskip, Bonney held animosity towards Luffy for assaulting a Celestial Dragon.

After the timeskip, Bonney praised Luffy for defeating Doflamingo.[77]

After entering Dr. Vegapunk's territory, Luffy ended up saving Bonney from drowning after she escaped the maw of a Mecha-Shark.[78] She thanked him for saving her but reminded him that they are rivals. Bonney showed disbelief that Luffy became an Emperor and has Jinbe as his crewmate.[79] Despite being rivals, they enjoyed eating food together from Vegapunk's vending machine.[80]

Bonney soon realized that Luffy is Nika although he is unaware of it. Bonney begs Luffy to show her how he can throw a punch at Jaygarcia Saturn, which he obliged.

Luffy originally called Bonney "Bogey" until he got her name right.

Seven Warlords of the Sea
Gecko Moria
Luffy Confronts Moria
Luffy finally reaches Gecko Moria on Thriller Bark.

Gecko Moria is the captain of the Thriller Bark Pirates, a former Warlord of the Sea, and was the antagonist of the Thriller Bark Arc. The two met when Luffy stumbled upon Moria's ship by chance and became enemies once Luffy had discovered what Moria had been doing to the people he captured, as well as for standing in the way of him recruiting Brook. The two do not like each other; Moria sees Luffy as a rookie who is naive about the reality of the world and a pain in his plans. Luffy dislikes Moria for taking people's shadows and trapping them on his ship.

When Luffy arrived in the Florian Triangle he met Brook, a lonely and trapped skeleton man who was also a musician. Whilst talking with Brook he was told about Moria and what he has been doing to people on his ship, and explained how he is also a victim and could not join his crew as a result. This made Luffy want to defeat Moria as he wanted Brook to join his crew. He landed on Thriller Bark and tediously had to fight his way through the entirety of the ship before he was able find, and defeat the Warlord after a grueling battle with him and his pet zombie, Oars.

Luffy does not like Moria and believes him to be cruel for taking other people's shadows for his own personal use, having met numerous zombies and other victims on Thriller Bark who were stranded there due to having their shadows taken by him and developing an aversion to sun light. Luffy also sees him as a rival, as he too wishes to become the Pirate King, which fueled his motive to fight and defeat him. When he arrived at the Summit War of Marineford he bemoaned having to deal with Moria again but was spared fighting him thanks to Jinbe.

Moria finds Luffy to be greatly irritating, and believed he was too inexperienced, much like Crocodile did, and warned him that even at his current strength, he would lose his crew just like he did. This prediction turned out to be true when the Straw Hats were scattered by Bartholomew Kuma at Sabaody Archipelago. Nonetheless, he did acknowledge Luffy's strength, as he stole his shadow to put into his most powerful zombie, Oars. He warned Luffy to go forth and see the terror of the New World after he was defeated by him. He was more annoyed and angrier than anybody else when Luffy arrived at the Summit War of Marineford, holding a grudge against the Straw Hat captain for defeating him and ending his ambitions. Despite this, he sought Luffy's shadow again because of his strength. Moria was the only member of the Warlords of the Sea to be shocked at the revelation that Luffy's father is Monkey D. Dragon.

Bartholomew Kuma
Kuma About To Take Luffy Away
Kuma about to take Luffy away on Thriller Bark.

Kuma is the former king of the Sorbet Kingdom, a former pirate, a former officer of the Revolutionary Army, a former Warlord of the Sea and a current slave. He appeared to Luffy and his crew at the end of the Thriller Bark Arc and again at the end of the Sabaody Archipelago Arc. The two have rarely interacted and as a result do not have a clear relationship. Kuma is an ally to Luffy, despite appearing to be an enemy, and seems to respect Luffy and his crew. Luffy initially loathed Kuma for his actions on Sabaody, however, he now recognizes him as a good person after Franky informed him of the things he did for them.

He appeared before Luffy and his crew on Thriller Bark after Luffy defeated Gecko Moria. He offered to spare all of their lives in exchange for Luffy's, but everyone refused. In response, he released his "Ursus Shock" attack, which only succeeded in knocking most of them out. Zoro, who was one of the people to stay conscious, offered his own life in Luffy's place, with Kuma agreeing. Before leaving, he made Zoro experience all the intense pain Luffy had accumulated in his fight with Moria. He reappeared on Sabaody and initially defended the Straw Hats from a Pacifista but then, using his Devil Fruit powers, forcibly separated the Straw Hats to different islands across the world. During the Summit War of Marineford, Luffy and Kuma crossed paths briefly, but did not engage in a serious battle.

Kuma appears to have taken a liking to Luffy and his crew, having gone to such great lengths for them. He remarked to himself on Thriller Bark that Luffy has loyal comrades and that Monkey D. Dragon would be proud of him. When he arrived on Sabaody, he saved the Straw Hats from a Pacifista, and his decision to separate Luffy and his crew was an act of mercy to save them from Admiral Kizaru, who had come to the island after Luffy punched a World Noble. Before he sent Luffy away, he told the Straw Hat captain that this would be the last time they would ever meet, as he was fully aware he was going to lose his free will and memories. Following the Summit War of Marineford, he convinced Dr. Vegapunk to allow him to complete one last mission of his own free will before becoming a full Pacifista. Vegapunk appeared to have accepted his request and allowed him to spend the next two years protecting the Straw Hat's ship, the Thousand Sunny, from thieves and pirates, greatly damaging his own body in the process.

Out of all the enemies Luffy has faced, Kuma is one of only two people that made him experience true despair, the other being Akainu. During their first encounter, Luffy was unconscious and was completely unaware who Kuma actually was. He was left completely devastated, and crushed, after being resoundingly defeated by Kuma on Sabaody and was distraught that he could not protect any of his friends from him, who were all sent flying one by one. However, at the time, Luffy had no idea this was actually Kuma saving him from Admiral Kizaru. Once it was revealed to him that Kuma had, in fact, saved them all and defended their ship throughout the time skip, Luffy remarked that he was a good guy after all. [81] After the time-skip when his Luffy and his crew arrived to Egghead Island Luffy and his crew would meet and save his daughter Jewelry Bonney.[82]

Boa Hancock
Luffy Hugs Hancock at Marineford
Luffy hugs Hancock.

Boa Hancock is the Empress of Amazon Lily, captain of the Kuja Pirates, and a former Warlord of the Sea. Hancock fell in love with Luffy after initially trying to kill him. Their relationship is often defined by her complete and growing love for him whilst he remains indifferent to her feelings. She was a crucial ally to Luffy during the Impel Down Arc and the Marineford Arc. While Luffy does not return her feelings, he nonetheless sees her as a genuine friend and thus cares for her a great deal. He is thankful for all the help she has provided for him.

They started out as enemies when they first met after Luffy was sent to Amazon Lily by Bartholomew Kuma and fell into her private bath house, finding Hancock naked, and seeing the slave mark on her back, something she found to be too severe for him to live. Her intrigue in Luffy began when she discovered that her Devil Fruit powers were completely useless against him, due to him not having any lustful desires for her despite seeing her naked. She then had him captured and ordered his execution via combat. During his fight with her sisters, she was left stunned when Luffy protected her sister's back to hide the slave mark from the crowd and called off the execution. After testing him in order to prove he is like all men, selfish and immoral, she is amazed to find he is nothing like she imagined (soon afterward he became her love interest). Eventually, she told Luffy the story about her slave mark and quickly fell in love with him. Hancock is willing to obey Luffy's orders.

Hancock's love for Luffy runs to extreme lengths, dropping her normally stoic and serious demeanor whenever in his presence, and often acts like a little girl in love. She constantly blushes over him and is overwhelmed whenever he says her name or makes any kind of physical contact with her. Despite being a rather intelligent person, she can easily exaggerate his interactions with her, such as during the Summit War of Marineford, when she believed that Luffy's hug was a marriage proposal. Hancock is completely unaffected by the news that Luffy's father is Monkey D. Dragon, the leader of the Revolutionary Army, despite his notorious reputation, simply stating she would not care if he was the son of the devil himself.

Love Sickness Infobox
Boa Hancock suffering from "Love Sickness" over Luffy.

Hancock's actions sometimes leads to her doting on Luffy because of her love for him. She has helped him on multiple occasions and tries to make sure he is well cared for in her company. She actively aided Luffy in his infiltration of Impel Down so he could rescue his brother Ace, as well as to deliver a message to him on Luffy's behalf. She also covertly gave Luffy the key to Ace's seastone handcuffs during the Summit War of Marineford. Throughout the battle, Hancock was completely worried for Luffy's well-being. She is very protective of him and holds complete and utter contempt for anyone who thinks about harming him and immediately came to Luffy's aid when Smoker attacked him, aggressively threatening the commodore. She tossed aside her obligations of aiding the Marines as a member of the Seven Warlords of the Sea to instead openly aid Luffy during the war, risking the protection status of Amazon Lily from the Marines. After the war, she was grief stricken when she discovered that Luffy was in a critical condition and was extremely concerned over his future well-being because of Ace's death. She barely ate her food back on Amazon Lily until she knew he would recover. Before Luffy began his training with Silvers Rayleigh, Hancock was angry with Rayleigh when he told her that she cannot come and give Luffy food throughout his training, but relented when he told her that it was for Luffy's benefit. After the two-year timeskip, she gave Luffy a comically large luggage filled with food, medicines, and various other things so he can look after himself. After Luffy returned to Sabaody Archipelago, she aided Luffy and his crew's escape by holding off the pursuing Marines. She posted a gigantic version of his new wanted poster on the wall of her castle.[83]

Hancock is surprised by Luffy's abilities in combat and his unique personality. She was irritated when he easily defeated Bacura and was left stunned when he was able to use Haoshoku Haki when fighting her sisters. His devotion to protect members of her own tribe who Luffy had made friends with both, surprised, and annoyed her. She was shocked when he chose to save Marguerite, Sweet Pea, and Aphelandra over benefiting himself. When Luffy saw her naked a second time and he simply asked why she responded that his rudeness never ceases to amaze her. After hearing that Luffy did the unthinkable and attacked a World Noble, and showing no regret, she was left completely speechless and crying at this revelation, stating she is happy there are people like Luffy still fighting the World Government and compared him favorably to Fisher Tiger. She teared up when Luffy said he harbored no hatred for Hancock for her past as a slave, admitting that she likes him and offered up her ship to him. It was after this interaction that she was soon stricken with "Love Sickness" over Luffy.

After the recent invasion of Amazon Lily, Hancock still desires to reunite with Luffy for her safety.

Hancock's love for Luffy is so strong that it passed down to her Seraphim clone, S-Snake when shown Luffy ordered S-Snake to undo her spell on Franky, Usopp and Lilith. S-Snake has Hancock's love for Luffy as a genetic source when she granted his order as well begged him to not look at her eyes directly. Luffy mistook S-Snake for the real Hancock. When Luffy thanked her for undoing her spell, S-Snake mistakenly believe that Luffy confessed her love for him much like the original Hancock.

Luffy, on his part, originally did not like Hancock and believed her to be a cruel person for attacking members of her own tribe for simply standing up for him. At one point he tells her that she makes him sick, causing her to almost collapse because of her vanity. However, he grows to like her after being given the offer to save the three girls, finding it generous of Hancock. Luffy was shocked to find out she was a slave to the World Nobles, and empathized with her horrific past. When he finally understood of her actions, Luffy quickly forgiven Hancock when he declared he never actually hates her for being a slave, but only loathed the World Nobles. He was extremely grateful when she offered up her ship to him so he could go and reunite with his crew. Luffy decided to keep her secret between them by never telling any of the Kuja. Although he does not reciprocate Hancock's love, he greatly appreciates everything she does for him, seeing her as a close friend and a trusted ally. He was willing to protect her when Magellan demanded to know how he got inside Impel Down, stating he would not tell him anything even if it meant his death. Despite Luffy rejecting her proposals, Hancock's love for Luffy only increased during the time-skip and with each refusal, she only becomes more determined to marry him no matter what. Although he refuses to marry her, he is still happy for the things she did for him and hopes to see her again someday.

Donquixote Doflamingo
Luffy Stops Doflamingo
Luffy stops Doflamingo from killing Law.

Donquixote Doflamingo is the former captain of the Donquixote Pirates, the Patriarch of the Donquixote Family, a former Warlord of the Sea, the former king of Dressrosa, and a former World Noble. Doflamingo proved to be one of Luffy's most frustrating enemies since the timeskip. Originally having no interest, Luffy ended up fighting him due to his alliance with Trafalgar Law. Doflamingo underestimated Luffy and believed him to just be a simple rookie, but grew irritated by his constant interference in his plans. Initially apathetic, Luffy came to despise Doflamingo for his cruelty and manipulation.

Doflamingo was well aware of who Luffy was well before the events of the Dressrosa Arc, as he attended a Seven Warlords of the Sea meeting in order to discuss Luffy's recent victory over Crocodile. When he gathered information on Luffy, he was visibly shocked that he has the initial, 'D', in his name. At the Summit War of Marineford, he was greatly amused when Luffy arrived, and even more so upon hearing that Luffy's father is Monkey D. Dragon, remarking that this explains why Ivankov was fighting alongside him. He commented that Luffy escaping with Ace would be more amusing to him and, as a result, he chose not to fight or hinder him. The two would eventually cross paths after Luffy allied with Trafalgar Law and arrived on Dressrosa where he worked with the various citizens there, as well as his fellow Colosseum fighters, to take him down.

The Warlord of the Sea grossly underestimated Luffy's abilities. This largely came down to believing in his own divinity and Luffy being of common blood. Having said that, he was well aware of Luffy's potential and warned his allies, Caesar Clown, Vergo, and Monet to be wary of him back on Punk Hazard. Nonetheless, due to his cunning and deceptive nature, he was able to frustrate Luffy throughout his time on Dressrosa. However, he began to hate Luffy because of his perseverance and constant interference, such as preventing him from killing Law several times and undoing all of Sugar's work. Such was his hatred, he decided to place a personal bounty on him and his allies to incite the citizens of Dressrosa to apprehend him. When Luffy activated Gear 4, he initially laughed at his appearance but found himself being quickly overwhelmed after the Straw Hat captain unleashed devastating attacks on him. Doflamingo then began to see Luffy as a great threat and used his awakened Devil Fruit powers to try and defeat him. When Luffy was rendered immobile for ten minutes, Doflamingo was relentless when trying to find him so he could make him pay for his actions. After his defeat and arrest, Doflamingo did not seem to hold a grudge against Luffy and instead was getting excited at the incoming chaos that will engulf the world because of his defeat.

Luffy did not take Doflamingo any more seriously than any of his previous enemies, and casually threatened him when he got in contact with him through a Den Den Mushi whilst on his way to Dressrosa. However, this changed when he found out that the Warlord has been turning humans into toys, that he dethroned Rebecca's grandfather, forced Bellamy to fight him, constantly attempting to kill Law,[84] and forced Rebecca to try to kill her own aunt, Viola. At one point, Luffy cried out Doflamingo's name in a complete rage. Doflamingo also managed to get hold of the Mera Mera no Mi, Ace's Devil Fruit, and used it as bait for Luffy by offering it up as a prize in his gladiatorial game. Earlier in the arc, Luffy had promised Rebecca that he would defeat Doflamingo for her, which served as one of the key motivators for him to take down the Warlord. Throughout the Dressrosa Arc, Luffy constantly referred to Doflamingo as "Mingo".

East Blue Pirates and Crews
Gaimon
Luffy and Gaimon Laughing
Luffy and Gaimon bonding.

Gaimon is a former pirate and the protector of the animals on the Island of Rare Animals. Although their time was brief, he and Luffy grew close and became fond of one another. Gaimon was very appreciative of Luffy's efforts on his behalf and was impressed by his determination to become the Pirate King. Luffy became endeared to Gaimon after hearing his story and gets along very well with him, and at one point offers Gaimon a place on his crew.

Following the Orange Town Arc, Luffy and his crew sailed towards the Island of Rare Beasts where they were attacked by Gaimon. However, once it was clear they were not a threat the pair quickly bonded. After hearing his story, he chose to try and aid Gaimon by retrieving the treasure that he came to the island looking for twenty years prior, however, they turned out to be empty. Nonetheless, Gaimon was grateful for Luffy's efforts and waved him off with tears in his eyes.

Gaimon got on well with Luffy, having initially mistaken him and his crew to be poachers, he was convinced that they were not a threat to the animals there. He felt comfortable enough to confined in Luffy about how he was a pirate that got stuck in a treasure chest after falling during his attempt to get the treasure he came looking for, and explaining that his crew had left him behind on the island. This made Luffy the first person he talked to about his situation. Despite Gaimon openly stating that he does not trust anyone to retrieve the treasure for him, he felt he could trust Luffy to retrieve it for him. He was saddened that the treasure chests turned out to be empty, but was nonetheless extremely grateful for Luffy's efforts. He was overwhelmed with emotion when Luffy offered a place to him on his crew, but turned him down because of his obligations to the animals on the island. He was sad to see Luffy go but was also happy to have made a friend like him, and wished him luck on his journey to find One Piece.

Luffy was amazed at Gaimon because of his large afro and being stuck inside a treasure chest. He had no hard feelings with Gaimon's initial hostility, and after hearing his story, came to like him. They bonded very quickly and got on well with each other. Luffy chose to aid him by getting the treasure chests that he has been guarding for twenty years, however, he was saddened to find they were all empty and tried to pretend he was going to steal it from him, as oppose to telling him the truth, but Gaimon deduced what he was doing. He then comforted Gaimon over his disappointment, telling him that he is happy to have met him and invited him to join his crew, although disappointed when he refused, he understood his reasoning. Luffy tends to refer to Gaimon as “uncle”.

Kuro
Gomu Gomu no Kane
Luffy defeats Kuro.

Kuro is the former captain of the Black Cat Pirates and was an enemy of Luffy during the Syrup Village Arc. The two did not like each other in the slightest and disagreed strongly on what it means to be a pirate. Kuro believed Luffy to be too naive and does not possess the necessary qualities to be a captain. Luffy loathed Kuro for how he treated his own crew members and for trying to harm his friends, Usopp and Kaya.

The two first met on Syrup Village when he was posing as Kaya's butler. However, it was soon revealed that he was orchestrating a plan to take Kaya's family fortunes for himself, which led to Luffy and Usopp working together to take down him and his crew. This resulted in Luffy defeating Kuro after a grueling fight and throwing his unconscious body back at his crew members, telling them to leave.

To Kuro, Luffy was an irrelevant and weak pirate. Despite evidence to the contrary, he maintained this view right up until he was defeated, as he believed his plans could not possibly fail. Kuro was extremely patronizing towards Luffy and convinced himself that the only reason he defeated his crew's best fighters was because they were unforgivably weak, rather than Luffy being too strong. He mocked Luffy's ideals of piracy and camaraderie, believing him to be too naive about the world and thus will be an inevitable failure.

When Luffy first met Kuro he did not like him in the slightest for how he treated his new friend, Usopp, and for the way he looked down on pirates. After he discovered his true identity and intentions, he came to hate him, finding his actions against Kaya to be despicable, and worked with Usopp to stop him. The two disagreed strongly on what it means to be a pirate, with Luffy scolding him for becoming a pirate in the first place when he could not take the reputation of being one. When Kuro began massacring his own crew members, Luffy flew into a rage, finding his actions absolutely abhorrent, and managed to stop him.

Zeff
Luffy And Zeff Meet
Luffy and Zeff meet and negotiate Luffy's payment for the damage he had done.

Zeff is a former pirate, the former captain of the Cook Pirates, and the head chef and owner of the Baratie, as well as Sanji's adoptive father. The two got off to a somewhat hostile start but came to respect each other after the events of the Baratie Arc. Zeff was originally angry with Luffy for the damage he had done to his restaurant but was won over by the Straw Hat captain's performance against a threatening Don Krieg. Luffy felt guilty for the damaged he had done to his restaurant but soon came to respect him as a former pirate and his role in raising Sanji, believing him to be a great man.

Whilst heading towards the Baratie, Luffy was attacked by Marine Lieutenant Fullbody's ship and deflected one of the cannon balls aimed at him towards the Baratie, damaging it. He was dragged into the restaurant and promptly apologized to the head chef, Zeff, and eventually agreed to work there for one full year. Once Don Krieg had arrived and became a clear threat to the people of the restaurant Luffy decided to fight him with the promise of not having to work at the restaurant if he won. Having defeated Krieg, Luffy was allowed to leave the Baratie and take Sanji along with him.

Zeff was initially furious with Luffy for the damage he had done to his ship and scolded the Straw Hat captain numerous times, but appeared to harbor some level of admiration for his personality. He was annoyed that Luffy did not have the money to pay for the damage and offered him a choice of either working for a full year at his restaurant as a chore boy or give up one of his legs. However, after Luffy proved to do more harm than good as a chore boy he accepted his offer of defeating Don Krieg for him in exchange for allowing Luffy to leave. It was during this fight that he became a strong admirer of the Straw Hat captain, being left nothing short of impressed by his determination, bravery and fighting spirit. He informed Sanji to observe Luffy closely, and to recognize the Straw Hat captain's sheer will power. By the end of the battle, after Luffy's victory, he had become so impressed by Luffy that he requested that he take Sanji along with him on his journey, signifying how much trust he has in Luffy to take care of the person he considered to be like a son.

Luffy felt very guilty about the damage he had done to Zeff's restaurant and initially thought he had blown off his leg but was reassured he did not. Such was his guilt, he begrudgingly agreed to work a full year as a chore boy. He ultimately respects Zeff, and felt compelled to defend him and his restaurant from Don Krieg when he arrived and threatened to take it. He also admired Zeff for how he raised Sanji, as he found out that Zeff had given up own his leg to save him and saw the parallels with how Shanks gave up his arm in order to rescue him. At one point he ridiculed Sanji for being willing to throw his life away after all Zeff had done for him. When Zeff asked him to forcibly take Sanji, he declined, as although he appreciated his offer, he wished for Sanji to choose to join his crew himself. Although they have not seen each other for over two years, Luffy still remembers Zeff and promised Sanji that he would not allow any harm to come to him or his restaurant when he was being blackmailed by his biological family, the Vinsmoke Family.

Don Krieg
Luffy Punches Krieg With Gomu Gomu no Bullet
Luffy fighting Krieg.

Don Krieg is the Admiral of the Krieg Pirates and the antagonist of the Baratie Arc. Both Luffy and Krieg fought each other after the latter intended to take over the Baratie and revealed his intention to become the Pirate King, causing Luffy to see him as a challenger. The two generally dislike each other, Krieg is annoyed by Luffy's open defiance towards him and perseverance throughout their fight, whilst Luffy dislikes Krieg because of his method of fighting and cruelty towards his own crew members.

The two first met during the Baratie Arc when Krieg tried to forcibly take over the restaurant and make it a part of his fleet. He attacked Luffy during Sanji's fight with Pearl and the two ended up fighting each other. Even though he used plenty of cheap tricks and deceptions, he was not able to keep Luffy down. Eventually, he was defeated by the Straw Hat captain who fought him with sheer determination.

Krieg found Luffy to be irritating because he continuously stated that he was stronger out of the two of them. Despite a slew of tricks and deceptions during their fight, Luffy would not stay down and kept getting back up, frustrating Krieg. Because of his ego and his belief that he is the most powerful captain in all of East Blue, he desired to have Luffy executed for daring to challenge him. After his defeat, Krieg unconsciously got up and demanded to continue the battle, only to be knocked down by Gin.

Luffy has a low opinion of Krieg because of his use of dirty tricks in battle and finds them ridiculous. At one point he asked Krieg if he was going to take the fight seriously. Luffy was not at all fazed by Krieg's insults, such as calling him a monkey, as he was confident that he is much stronger than Krieg and it became more apparent, throughout the fight, that he was frustrating him with his will power. Luffy was furious when Krieg insulted Gin after he was poisoned by the "MH5" gas, that Krieg had launched onto the battlefield, because he gave his own gas mask to Luffy.

Arlong Pirates
Arlong
Arlong Lies Defeated
Arlong lies defeated after his fight with Luffy.

Arlong is a fish-man, the former captain of the Arlong Pirates, a former member of the Sun Pirates and was the main antagonist of the Arlong Park Arc. The two strongly dislike each other. Luffy especially loathes Arlong because of what he has done to Nami since her childhood and believes Arlong to be an exceptionally cruel and despicable person. Arlong dislikes Luffy, not just for being a human, but for being a pest that interfered with his ambitions to eventually rule the world.

After Nami had taken his ship, the Going Merry, and the treasure, Luffy sailed after her and arrived on Cocoyasi Village, Nami's hometown. He intended to get her back in his crew but was rebuffed numerous times. When Arlong betrayed Nami he saw her crying and stopped her stabbing her tattoo, she turned to him and asked for his help, with Luffy screaming of course he will. Luffy proceeded to storm Arlong's base, Arlong Park, alongside Zoro, Sanji, and Usopp and fought the fish-man, eventually defeating him and winning Nami back into his crew, as well as liberating Cocoyasi Village.

Arlong thought very little of Luffy and did not consider the possibility that he was the captain of his group, instead assuming it to be Zoro. Due to his arrogance, and opinion that fish-men are superior to humans, he underestimated Luffy and was eventually defeated by him. Throughout his fight with the Straw Hat captain he grew greatly irritated by Luffy's persistence and tenacity. When inside Nami's old room Arlong became antagonistic to Luffy, trying to annoy the Straw Hat captain with taunts about Nami. He lost his composure and confidence when Luffy decided to destroy the makeshift prison that had all of Nami's maps that she drew for him since childhood. In his fit of rage he tried to attack Luffy but allowed himself to be on the receiving end of his final attack.

Luffy holds complete hatred for Arlong. As soon as he met him Luffy wasted no time punching him, chastising the fish-man for making Nami cry. Despite the strength Arlong possessed, Luffy was absolutely determined to defeat him even though he admitted that he has no special skills like his other crew members. When they ended up in Nami's room during their fight, Arlong remarked that he would use her for his plans to dominate the world, angering him. Luffy deduced that the room they were in was a prison for Nami, which angered him even further. He decided to trash the room and destroy all of the work Nami had been forced to do for Arlong. His determination went so far as to try destroy Arlong Park all together, doing so with a final attack that simultaneously knocked the fish-man out. He emerged from the rubble with great satisfaction of having defeated Arlong and freeing Nami from him. Luffy's hatred for Arlong has spread to people who were associated with him, such as Hatchan, who he initially refused to save upon realizing he used to be part of Arlong's pirate crew.

Hatchan
Hatchan Tries To Stop Luffy
Hatchan attempts to stop Luffy attacking a World Noble.

Hatchan is a fish-man and a former pirate of the Arlong Pirates and Sun Pirates. He was an antagonist to Luffy and his crew during the Arlong Park Arc but became an ally during the Sabaody Archipelago Arc and the Fish-Man Island Arc. Though they started off as enemies, the two now genuinely care and respect each other, forming a strong friendship. Hatchan, despite having once been his enemy, held no dislike for Luffy and quickly became friends with him. Luffy loathed Hatchan as he was partly responsible for Nami's suffering under Arlong, but has come to like him a lot since they became allies.

The two briefly met during the Arlong Park Arc after Luffy had broken down the entrance to Arlong Park and proceeded to punch Arlong. Hatchan briefly tried to attack Luffy but was goaded into a fight with Zoro that he eventually lost. They would meet again after Luffy met Camie who took him to save her friend, Hatchan, from the Flying Fish Riders. Despite not wanting to do so initially, he saved Hatchan after Nami told him she was fine with it. He then joined Luffy and his crew to Sabaody Archipelago. Whilst on Sabaody he was shot by the Celestial Dragon, Charlos, which incurred Luffy's anger upon the Celestial Dragon. Eventually, the Straw Hats were scattered off the island by Bartholomew Kuma. They reunited two years later on Fish-Man Island where he was supportive of Luffy defeating Hody Jones.

Hatchan is fond of Luffy and treats him as a very good friend, despite initially trying to kill him back when he was a member of the Arlong Pirates. He admires Luffy's abilities and is grateful that he saved, not only him, but Camie as well. When Camie was kidnapped and taken to the Human Auction House he tried to stop Luffy from doing anything rash as he did not want him earning the wrath of the World Nobles. After he was shot by the Celestial Dragon, Charlos, Hatchan tearfully begged Luffy not to attack him, telling the Straw Hat captain this is what he deserves for being a pirate anyway, as well as apologizing for the trauma him and his crew had inflicted on Nami. He was happy to be reunited with Luffy and his crew on Fish-Man Island two years later and agreed with Jinbe's plan to make Luffy a hero of Fish-Man Island by taking out Hody Jones. He bid the Straw Hat's farewell as they left the island.

Luffy initially hated Hatchan for his role in Nami's suffering, outright refusing to aid him once he realized who he was. However, after Nami told him she was fine with saving him he agreed to do so, and after getting to know Hatchan, quickly became friends with him. He bonded with him on Sabaody and was extraordinarily angry when he saw Charlos shoot Hatchan. The Celestial Dragon's taunts pushed him to the point where he delivered an extremely powerful punch to the face of the World Noble, in spite of the consequences. He empathized with Hatchan as he tearfully informed Luffy of the tremendous regret he had for what he and his crew had done to Nami, believing him to be sincere about his guilt. When they reunited on Fish-Man Island Luffy was very happy to see him again. He is very fond of Hatchan's takoyaki.

Paradise Pirates and Crews
Roger Pirates
Crocus
Crocus And Straw Hats Discuss Log Pose
Crocus with Luffy as he informs his crew of the nature of the Grand Line.

Crocus is a doctor, a former member of the Roger Pirates, and the caretaker of Laboon. Luffy first met him during the Reverse Mountain Arc and quickly befriended him. The two get on well and have developed a respect for one another. Crocus is grateful for Luffy's role in healing Laboon's suffering and noted his similarity to his former captain, Gol D. Roger. Luffy, like the rest of his crew, found Crocus to be an odd person but came to respect him for his determination to care for Laboon.

During the Reverse Mountain arc, Luffy arrived on the Grand Line only to get immediately swallowed up by Laboon where he eventually met Crocus after being separated from his crew. After defeating Miss Wednesday and Mr. 9, he became friends with the doctor and was able to escape the inside of Laboon thanks to his help. After helping Laboon cope with missing his friends and discussing the nature of Grand Line with Crocus, along with getting a log pose from him, he left Reverse Mountain.

Crocus was able to make quick friends with Luffy and found him to be an interesting character. He was thankful that he knocked out Miss Wednesday and Mr. 9 as they were attacking Laboon. He was also extremely grateful for how Luffy helped Laboon overcome his depression of losing his friends. Crocus also came to care for Luffy, as he was concerned when he was fighting the giant whale, but was reassured by Nami that Luffy will be fine. He also aided Luffy and his crew in understanding the magnetic fields of the Grand Line and the necessity of a log pose, even giving his own log pose when the one they found was broken by Sanji and Luffy as a way to thank him. As Luffy sailed away, he noted that Luffy has a mysterious aura around him, a lot like his former captain, Gol D. Roger, and commented that he and his crew might be the people that him, and the rest of the Roger Pirates, have been waiting for.

Luffy was impressed by Crocus' determination to look after Laboon, and even though he did not understand the situation, chose to aid him and Laboon when Miss Wednesday and Mr. 9 attacked him. When he found he was a doctor he request Crocus to join his crew, but he declined. Luffy listened to Crocus tell the story of Laboon, despite appearing disinterested as he was climbing a tree at one point, and chose to help him in his quest to help Laboon by fighting the giant whale, having understood the nature of the whale's friendship with the missing crew. He was thankful for the information Crocus provided about the Grand Line and for providing him and his crew with a new log pose.

When meeting Rayleigh, he was quite surprised to learn Crocus was a member of the Roger Pirates.

Silvers Rayleigh
Rayleigh and Luffy Bonding
Rayleigh and Luffy bonding during the timeskip.

Luffy first met Silvers Rayleigh on Sabaody Archipelago and became immediately interested in him when he revealed he is the former first mate of the Pirate King, Gol D. Roger. Luffy respects Rayleigh's wisdom and knowledge and was enthusiastic to hear about his stories of Roger. The two created a close student-teacher relationship during the two-year time skip, with Luffy respecting his authority as a mentor and willing to accept the punishment of not being allowed to eat food.[85] Rayleigh becomes a huge catalyst for Luffy's progression, being largely responsible for his major increase in strength post time-skip.

Rayleigh developed a great interest in Luffy after hearing about him from Shanks. Since then, he had been eager to meet him. He has noted Luffy's similarities with his old friend and captain, Gol D. Roger, on several occasions and because of this, unlike a lot of others, Rayleigh never really expresses shock over Luffy's actions. He seems to be pleased that Luffy is exactly the person he believes, and wants him, to be. He throws Luffy a question at one point, asking him if he truly thinks that he is capable of conquering these unforgiving seas, but was pleasantly surprised when Luffy wished not to conquer anything but instead just desires to have the most freedom. Despite his great intrigue in the Straw Hat captain, he is capable of getting annoyed by Luffy, such as when the latter accidentally knocked over his bowl of food during training and proceeded to hit him.

After meeting Rayleigh at the Human Auctioning House, Luffy was able to develop a friendship with him to such a point that he was willing to coat the Straw Hats' ship in Yarukiman Resin for free, and he revealed himself to Admiral Kizaru in order to protect Luffy and his crew. Immediately following the end of the Summit War of Marineford, he swam through the Calm Belt to reach Amazon Lily, where Luffy was recovering, in order to train him. It was Rayleigh that rationalized the necessity of Luffy becoming stronger and to not rush back into the fray, warning him that he and his crew would just end up experiencing the same failure they did back at Sabaody. Luffy agreed and Rayleigh assisted him with leaving a message for his crew. While on Rusukaina, the two would begin to develop a close bond while Rayleigh rigorously trained Luffy in the use of Haki and helped him to develop his powerful Gear 4 form. He explained to Luffy how Haki works, informing him that his Haki will become stronger in the heat of battle when he fights other powerful Haki users.

Rayleigh had become satisfied with Luffy's progress that he chose to leave him on his own for the last six months of his training so he can further his progress independently. Once the Straw Hats had reunited back on Sabaody, Luffy declared to Rayleigh that he would become the Pirate King as he ran towards the Thousand Sunny, Rayleigh smiled with tears in his eyes.[86] He then helped in their escape by holding off the Marines by drawing a line in the ground for them to not cross whilst stating with pride that his apprentice is setting sail. He later told his wife, Shakuyaku, that Luffy is a man worthy of the straw hat, revealing to her that it was once worn by Roger, and commented that it might not be a bad idea to live a little longer in order to see the rest of Luffy's progress.[87]

Bellamy
Luffy And Bellamy Reunite in Dressrosa
Luffy and Bellamy reunite in Dressrosa.

Bellamy is a former pirate, the former captain of the Bellamy Pirates, and a former member of the Donquixote Pirates. He and Luffy started out on negative terms but have become very good friends. The two first met back on Jaya where he ended up fighting, and losing, to Luffy. By the time of the Dressrosa Arc Bellamy had come to respect Luffy and the two now get on really well. Bellamy looks at Luffy with great admiration and respect after his loss to him, whilst Luffy acknowledges him as a reformed person and a good friend.

When they met, Bellamy loathed Luffy for believing in legends and dreams, chastising him for thinking the sky islands existed and that the One Piece is real. He began to assault Luffy, but the Straw Hat captain refused to fight back and was ultimately dragged out by Nami alongside Zoro. After seeing that Luffy's bounty was much higher than his own, Bellamy refused to believe this was true and instead claimed that it was forged by the Straw Hat Pirates. Luffy's attitude changed once he discovered that Bellamy and his crew had assaulted and robbed Mont Blanc Cricket at his house. He then returned to the bar Bellamy was at and got into another fight. Bellamy taunted Luffy and charged up his strongest attack, but Luffy knocked him out instantly. After visiting a sky island himself, he met Luffy again at Dressrosa, he reacquainted himself with Luffy and dropped his patronizing attitude towards him, vowing to never laugh at him again.

Bellamy respects Luffy to a great extent, accepting that he was wrong to doubt him. Other than Doflamingo, Luffy is the only other person he looks up to. When he was ordered to assassinate Luffy by Doflamingo he was extremely reluctant to do so despite wanting to join his family. He seeks to emulate Luffy's passion to stand by his principals and chooses to do the same. This led to him having to fight Luffy again, on Doflamingo's orders, even though he wished not to do so and was completely distraught throughout. However, he found solace in the idea of being defeated by someone he admired. When he was defeated by Luffy once again he thanked the Straw Hat captain for considering him a friend. After Doflamingo's defeat, Bellamy refuses to join the Straw Hat Grand Fleet, as he did not wish to be Luffy's subordinate. Nonetheless, he took a piece of Luffy's Vivre Card should he ever need his help.

Luffy acknowledges Bellamy as a reformed man and respects him greatly. He cheered him on during his match in Block B and engaged in a friendly chat with him. He was angry when he saw how badly Doflamingo had beaten him up and outright declared Bellamy to be his friend. He became even more upset when Doflamingo had managed to force Bellamy into fighting him and tried to convince Bellamy not to fight. This caused Luffy to curse Doflamingo's name after having to knock out someone he considered a friend and fueled his hatred for the Warlord.

Foxy
Foxy Being Rejected by the Straw Hats
Foxy's feelings get hurt when Luffy and the Straw Hats say they do not want him in their crew.

Foxy is the captain of the Foxy Pirates and the antagonist of the Long Ring Long Land Arc. He and Luffy met on Long Ring Long Land when the two of them competed in a Davy Back Fight. The pair, generally, do not get along well. Luffy regularly hurts Foxy's pride while Foxy is intentionally antagonistic towards the Straw Hat captain. He is very overconfident in front of Luffy and grossly underestimated the Straw Hat Pirates even though they have a much higher bounty than his own crew.

When on Long Ring Long Land, Foxy decided to try and claim some new crew members in a Davy Back Fight and targeted the Straw Hats. He antagonized their captain, Luffy, by shooting Tonjit's hooooorse, Shelly, and successfully goaded Luffy into participating in his game. The two crews won numerous round each, but Luffy and the Straw Hats finished as the ultimate winners, with neither crew losing any members, but still managed to part on hostile terms.

Foxy found Luffy to be a frustrating challenger to his game, having been undefeated, and is openly hypocritical throughout his matches with Luffy and the Straw Hats, using underhanded tactics but chastising Luffy and his crew for thinking up some of their own tactics. Foxy is not above being a petty loser, especially with Luffy, as when the Straw Hats won the last game, Foxy seemingly went to congratulate Luffy but instead tried to get revenge with a sneak attack, but this failed due to Luffy's rubber body. Because of Luffy hurting his pride repeatedly, Foxy decided to challenge him in combat as their final game. He used various tricks and traps to try to defeat Luffy, with each one ending in failure, and in the end, he was defeated. He teared up out of gratitude when Luffy decided to take his jolly roger, but not his sails so that he could continue traversing the seas. However, he has sworn vengeance on Luffy for giving him a poorly drawn jolly roger as a replacement for the one he had claimed.

Luffy thought poorly of Foxy, believing him to be a weird person, but did not hold any serious animosity towards his rival captain, even though he was frustrated when he took Chopper from his crew. He was nonetheless furious when Foxy shot Shelly, and agreed to partake in his game. With the reward of winning a Davy Back Fight being a crew member from the opposing team, Luffy, at one point, contemplated trying to claim Foxy himself, as that would mean they wouldn't have to play anymore, but decided against it because he did not want a ‘weirdo' like Foxy in his crew, hurting his feelings. In the anime, having also won the last game, Luffy was in a position to take the entirety of Foxy's crew, made up of 500 members from winning so many Davy Back Fights, however, he decided to claim them but immediately kick them out of his crew so they could go back to Foxy. Although this was mostly because Luffy did not want such a large crew than out of any kindness for Foxy, he still did not try to keep any of Foxy's shipwrights, despite being in search of one.

Charlotte Lola
Luffy Shows Lola Ace's Vivre Card
Luffy shows Lola his brother's Vivre Card.

Charlotte Lola is the captain of the Rolling Pirates, the 23rd daughter of the emperor, Big Mom, and an ally of Luffy and the Straw Hats during the Thriller Bark Arc. The two get on very well with each other and see one another as good friends. Lola is extremely impressed by Luffy's physical capabilities and sheer will power. By the end of the Thriller Bark arc she comes to see Luffy and his crew as her saviors. Luffy is very thankful for Lola's help in taking down Gecko Moria and his zombie, Oars, and appreciates her advice regarding Ace's Vivre Card.

After meeting Brook, Luffy wished to take down Gecko Moria and arrived on his ship to defeat the Warlord. Luffy found Moria and chased him into the forest but lost him. Luffy was then found by the Risky Brothers and was taken to Lola where she then offered her aid in defeating Moria. She and her crew began forcing shadows they had collected, thanks to Moria's Devil Fruit, inside Luffy and turned him into "Nightmare Luffy". He then took on Oars and Gecko Moria, eventually defeating both of them in a grueling fight whilst Lola aided his crew as best she could. Following the fight, after a brief encounter with another Warlord of the Sea, Bartholomew Kuma, Luffy and Lola celebrated their victory and parted ways.

Lola came to have incredibly high admiration and faith in Luffy. After being stuck on Thriller Bark for three years due to Moria claiming her shadow, as well as the rest of her crew's, she had lost a lot of hope of ever escaping. However, Luffy arriving on the island and causing complete chaos compelled her to put her faith in him. Luffy's power greatly impressed her, as she watched him in amazement throughout his fight with both Oars and Moria. This faith in Luffy compelled her to aid her fellow captain by putting purified shadows inside him in order to increase his strength and was left stunned that Luffy could take 100 purified shadows, finding it inconceivable at just how strong willed he is. Her faith is so high that she decided to risk her own life by staying out of the shade whilst the sun rose as she believed that Luffy would get her shadow back before the sunlight killed her.

Following Luffy's victory, she was very grateful for what he had done and was more than prepared to face off against Kuma in order to protect Luffy. Having survived Kuma's attack, she happily partied with Luffy and his crew and later gave Luffy's crew mate, Nami, her mother's Vivre Card, as she was under the impression she was still on good terms with her mother and that she would help Luffy and his crew in the New World. She also informed the Straw Hat captain about the state of Ace's Vivre Card when he showed it to her and warned him that his brother is in danger. At one point, she asked Luffy to marry her but was rejected for the 4444th time.

Luffy was very sympathetic to Lola's situation and felt bad that she has been stuck on the island for three years because of Gecko Moria. He also respected her as a fellow captain and agreed to her plan in order to take down Moria and Oars, but was caught off guard by having to have 100 shadows put into him. Nonetheless, he was very happy for her help and celebrated his victory over Moria by having a party with Lola and her crew. He was saddened when she informed him about the dire situation Ace is in due to the condition of his Vivre Card but appreciated her warning. After he was captured by the Big Mom Pirates, he defended Lola from her mother, telling the emperor that Lola made her own choice and that the only person to blame for her failing to become the Pirate King is herself. Despite the positive relationship he has with Lola, he still outright rejected her marriage proposal, becoming the 4444th person to do so.

Kuja Pirates
Kuja Fascination With Luffy
Kuja Pirates stretching Luffy's skin.

The Kuja Pirates are an infamous, and powerful, all-female crew led by the Pirate Empress, Boa Hancock, from the Kuja Tribe. They share an extremely positive relationship with Luffy after they became infatuated with the Straw Hat captain due to him being the first man, they have had a serious interaction with. Their relationship improved further after he won the approval of Hancock and discovered he has a rubber body. Luffy is very kind and friendly with the Kuja Pirates and appreciates their help since being separated from his friends.

Luffy arrived on Amazon Lily, the home of the Kuja Tribe and the Kuja Pirates, after he was separated from his crew by Bartholomew Kuma. Whilst running rampant on the island, the Kuja Pirates returned to the island with their captain, Boa Hancock, where he was eventually captured by the Pirate Empress. The members of the Kuja Pirates watched on, along with the rest of the Kuja Tribe, as Luffy was to be executed. They were shocked to see Marguerite, Aphelandra and Sweet Pea defend Luffy and accepted Hancock petrifying the trio. The execution was called off after Luffy prevented everyone, including the Kuja Pirates, from seeing the slave mark on Boa Sandersonia's back. After he won the approval of Hancock they have become very friendly with Luffy.

Just like every member of the Kuja Tribe, the members of the Kuja Pirates are obsessed with Luffy. This comes from him being the first and only man they have been permitted to interact and bond with. They find him to be a fun and kind person and enjoy partying with the Straw Hat captain. Although they did initially dislike Luffy and wanted to see him executed as that is what their Pirate Empress wished for, who they idolize. They were stunned when he continuously made offensive remarks towards Hancock and could not believe how much of a capable fighter he was, especially when he defeated Bacura, overwhelmed Sandersonia and Marigold, and used Haoshoku Haki, knocking some of them out. It is because of this idolization of Hancock that they quickly accepted Luffy once he won her affection and have since become very devoted to him. They were happy to aid him when he travelled with Hancock to Impel Down, and again when taking him back to Marineford to deliver a message for his crew. Following the time skip, the Kuja Pirates arrived on Rusukaina to pick up Luffy and return him to his crew on Sabaody Archipelago, waving goodbye to him and wishing to see him again someday. The Kuja eventually hanged a giant portait of Luffy's bounty at the castle wall.

Luffy was frustrated by the Kuja Pirates for seemingly being indifferent that their friends had been petrified by Boa Hancock. However, he did not hold a particular opinion of them and befriended them all quickly after he became friends with Hancock. He happily partied with the members of the Kuja Pirates but was annoyed by their obsession with his rubber body, although he has since, seemingly, come to tolerate it. He greatly appreciated their help for getting him to Impel Down and again when they transported him to Marineford following the battle there, openly apologizing to them for the hassle. After the time skip, he returned to the Kuja Pirate and waved goodbye to them as he returned to Sabaody to reunite with his crew. He has made specific friends with some members of the Kuja Pirates, such as Marguerite, Aphelandra and Sweet Pea, who joined the crew after the time-skip, and gets on well with Daisy, Rindo and Ran, tolerating their constant stretching of his skin.

Due to Hancock loving Luffy, the Kuja are completely loyal towards Luffy and worshiping him as an exceptional man. During the banquet, the Kuja are laughing in amusement at Luffy's funny performances. Kuja now hold a desire of touching and stretching Luffy's rubbery skin. They also addressed Luffy as "Luffy-sama" in a honorific way.

Boa Sandersonia and Boa Marigold
Boa Sandersonia And Boa Marigold Talking With Luffy
Boa Sandersonia and Boa Marigold with Luffy.

Boa Sandersonia and Boa Marigold are the sisters of the Pirate Empress, Boa Hancock, the second-in command of the Kuja Pirates, and are members of the Kuja Tribe. The pair were originally hostile to Luffy due to their fierce loyalty towards their sister, who had a strong dislike towards him. However, they became friendly with Luffy after he helps them during his execution and later winning over Hancock. They have since become very committed allies to the Straw Hat captain. Luffy was initially angry with the sisters for threatening Marguerite, but has managed to come and see them as good friends.

After arriving on Amazon Lily, Luffy was saved by members of the Kuja Tribe and was taken to their village only to be imprisoned after they discovered he is a man. He escaped and ended up landing in Boa Hancock's bathhouse whilst the Pirate Empress was bathing. Both Sandersonia and Marigold barged in and apprehended Luffy after it was revealed he had seen Hancock's slave mark. The pair then attempted to execute Luffy via combat, but the event was called off after Luffy helped cover Sandersonia's slave mark from the spectating Kuja Tribe. After Luffy bonded with Hancock, the sisters came to respect Luffy and expressed their gratitude towards him.

Both Sandersonia and Marigold were outright hostile towards Luffy. Unlike the rest of the Kuja Tribe, they have no actual curiosity with Luffy being a man due to their cruel experiences with men when they were children. They were both openly antagonistic towards Luffy and patronized him throughout their fight. At one point, Sandersonia attempted to torment Luffy by smashing the petrified Marguerite, having realized that he cares for her. Despite this, they were not above complimenting Luffy, as both acknowledged him as a capable fighter. They were surprised when he effortlessly defeated Bacura and were completely stunned when Luffy unleashed his Haoshoku Haki on them. Luffy's compassion has caught Sandersonia and Marigold off guard, too, as they were confused when Luffy moved Marguerite, Aphelandra and Sweet Pea out of the ring so they would be safe, and were shocked when Luffy requested to have the three women saved, rejecting the offer of returning to his crew with the help of the Kuja Pirates from Hancock.

Their attitude towards Luffy changed when, during their fight, Sandersonia's slave mark was revealed and Luffy covered it up for her so the spectators would not see it. This confused the sisters, but they ultimately became grateful for his actions and expressed their gratitude before he went to visit Boa Hancock in her chambers, showing a much more friendlier side towards him. They were left speechless at the news that Luffy had recently assaulted a World Noble and also shared a hatred for the World Nobles like they do. The two are very indulging of Hancock's feelings for Luffy, despite initially being outraged with the Straw Hat captain for requesting Hancock to fulfill her Warlord obligations in order to help him save his brother, Ace. Both Sandersonia and Marigold were saddened to see a heavily injured Luffy but were relieved that he had gotten through his grief of losing Ace, having delivered him some food along with Hancock. After the time skip, the pair picked up Luffy from Rusukaina, where he has been training for two years, and were impressed that he had tamed the beasts on the island.

Despite their hostility towards him, Luffy did not wish to truly harm the sisters and fought them half-heartedly. However, at varying points he became overwhelmed by the pair, and when Sandersonia threatened Marguerite he became enraged and unleashed his Haoshoku Haki. He then activated Gear 2 to dominate the sisters. Luffy showed his sincerity towards the sisters by covering Sandersonia's back, as he understood how important it is that nobody, especially the Kuja Tribe, sees her slave mark. He explained to them that he has no intention of killing them or allowing their secret to get out. Following his attempted execution he immediately became friendly with the sisters and empathized with their suffering at the hands of the World Nobles, openly stating his shared hatred for them. Due to their tragic pasts as slaves of the World Nobles, Luffy quickly forgiven the sisters and decided to keep their secret between them by never telling the Kuja. He was very grateful for the aid the sisters provided for him when he travelled with Hancock to Impel Down and during his recovery following the Summit War of Marineford. He was happy to meet them again after two years and thanked the sisters, along with Hancock, for taking him back to Sabaody Archipelago, before waving goodbye to them.

Marguerite
Luffy and Marguerite
Luffy and Marguerite together whilst he tries to escape Amazon Lily.

Marguerite is a member of the Kuja tribe and the Kuja Pirates. She and Luffy first met during the Amazon Lily Arc and, after briefly being enemies, became good allies and friends with each other. Marguerite finds Luffy very interesting since he is the first man she has met and thinks of him as a kind and sincere person, ultimately coming to care for him. Luffy finds her to be an impressive and strong fighter and is grateful to her for saving his life, twice. He cares for her a lot and considers her to be a close friend.

Whilst out exploring their jungle, Marguerite and her friends come across Luffy who had fallen unconscious from eating too many Body Mushrooms. They carried him back to their village, mended him back to health and bathed him before being told by Gloriosa that he is a man, shocking them all. After being locked away, Luffy manages to escape and kidnaps Marguerite as she was in possession of Silvers Rayleigh's Vivre Card. Whilst alone, they end up bonding, and at one point Marguerite saves Luffy's life when he starts to drown. However, she tries to attack Luffy again and he is forced to run away. He was then captured by Boa Hancock and was set to be executed. During his execution, Marguerite, along with Sweet Pea and Aphelandra, were turned to stone by Hancock for standing up for Luffy, but were eventually saved after Luffy convinced Hancock to undo her petrification on them. They have since been on good terms and are always happy to see each other.

Marguerite thinks Luffy is a great person and a great friend. Like all the women of the Kuja tribe, she finds him to be extremely interesting because he is the first man she has ever met. She offered Luffy some fresh clothes that she had made for him whilst he was imprisoned despite being somewhat fearful of him. When she was kidnapped by Luffy she was initially hostile but soon became comfortable enough to talk to him, but found him to be bizarre. Marguerite has come to care for Luffy a great deal since they met, being concerned for his well-being and has saved his life on two occasions. She chose to save him when he started to drown after he made a raft to get back to Sabaody Archipelago, but nonetheless told herself she cannot become attached and tried to kill him immediately after. Believing that Luffy was not as bad as her tribe believed, she chose to stand up for him but was turned to stone by Hancock. When Luffy was being harassed by the women of the Kuja tribe she helped him escape and took him to Elder Nyon's house where she made him tea.

The two tend to have pleasant conversations and end up chatting about pirates, with Marguerite informing Luffy that her empress, Boa Hancock, is also a pirate. She finds him to be incredibly restless, and his simple-mindedness bewildering, but has come to see it as an amusing side of him. She is very grateful to Luffy for protecting, and then saving, her life after she was turned to stone and thanked him whilst they ran across the roof tops of the Kuja village. She has become fond of Luffy and said goodbye to him when he left with Hancock to save his brother, Ace. She was overjoyed when she heard Luffy had returned from the Summit War of Marineford, looking forward to seeing him again, and intended to make some clothes for him but without the frills this time. Following the time-skip, she escorted Luffy back to Sabaody as part of the Kuja Pirates and was happy to see him again if only briefly. As a gag, she is curious to see the inside of Luffy's "Kintama", or testicles.

Luffy cares for Marguerite a great deal and had no serious issue with her initial hostile attitude towards him, instead trying to reassure her that he was not a threat. He was very thankful she saved his life after he was informed he would have died due to eating too many Body Mushrooms. Although he was initially thankful that she made him some fresh clothes, he was irritated that they had frills stitched onto them, but was happy when she removed them for him. After he took her somewhere quiet, he was grateful that she had kept his Vivre Card safe and was thankful when she saved his life once again after he started to drown whilst trying to sail a raft back to Sabaody. Later, he was thankful when she escorted him to Elder Nyon's house and away from the Kuja women who were hounding him.

He is very protective of her, as when she was turned to stone after she stood up for him he was extremely angry with Hancock, finding her actions to be sickening. He moved her, as well as Aphelandra and Sweet Pea, out of the arena so they would be safe during his fight. When Boa Sandersonia picked up Marguerite with her tail to smash her he became incredibly distressed and angrily unleashed his Haoshoku Haki to tell Sandersonia not to harm her. He proceeded to check her body for any cracks and moved her back to safety. Luffy chose to save Marguerite, and the others, over returning to his crew, being grateful when Boa Hancock undid the petrification on her and the others. Following the time skip, he was happy to see her again and protected her from the beasts on Rusukaina, who he had managed to tame. He was very happy to see she had joined the Kuja Pirates.

Aphelandra
Aphelandra Stops Luffy
Luffy crashes into Aphelandra's chest whilst trying to escape.

Aphelandra is a member of the Kuja Tribe and the Kuja Pirates. She is a brief antagonist and supporting ally of Luffy during the Amazon Lily Arc. Like all of the Kuja women, she has a great interest in Luffy because he is a man, whilst also finding him to be a funny and kind person. Luffy came to see Aphelandra as his friend after she stood up for him during his execution and has been very kind to her since then.

Whilst out exploring their jungle, Aphelandra, along with Marguerite and Sweet Pea, came across an unconscious Luffy and carried him back to their village. After mending him back to health, and bathing him, she was startled to discover he was actually a man, having assumed he was a woman. Luffy was then put inside a cage but was soon able to escape. Aphelandra pursued Luffy and at one point blocked his path, but he managed to get away. Eventually, Luffy was caught by the Pirate Empress, Boa Hancock, and was to be executed. Before his execution, Aphelandra attempted to defend Luffy, along with Marguerite and Sweet Pea, but was petrified by Hancock. After Luffy had won over Hancock, Aphelandra was saved at Luffy's request and has since become a good friend of Luffy's.

Unlike the majority of the Kuja women, Aphelandra held no real animosity towards Luffy. She felt guilty for having to try and attack him just for being a man and apologized when she blocked his path. This kind heartedness is what led to her risking her own life to try and speak favorably for Luffy. Once she had been saved, she became grateful for Luffy's efforts and, like the rest of the Kuja women, became openly friendly with Luffy. She finds him incredibly funny and enjoyed his presence during the festivities that were held. Following the Summit War of Marineford, she was overjoyed at his return and was eager to see him again. After the time-skip, now part of the Kuja pirates, she aided Luffy's return to Sabaody Archipelago and bid him farewell.

Luffy showed no hostility towards Aphelandra despite her having to attack him, and chose to flee from her, like the rest of the Kuja, rather than fight. He was extremely grateful for saving his life when he ate too many body mushrooms and was thankful when she chose to stand up for him. He was furious with Boa Hancock for petrifying her, and the other two, and demanded the Pirate Empress turn them back to normal. He carried her body outside of the ring so that she would be safe from any potential harm during his fight with Hancock's sisters, Boa Marigold and Boa Sandersonia. He was very thankful for her aid, following the time-skip, when returning to Sabaody Archipelago and wished her farewell.

Sweet Pea
Luffy Bathed By Kuja Tribe
Sweet Pea bathes Luffy along with Marguerite.

Sweet Pea is a member of the Kuja Tribe and the Kuja Pirates. She was briefly an antagonist to Luffy, but became a supporting ally to him during the Amazon Lily Arc. Like all the women of the Kuja Tribe, she has a great interest in Luffy because he is a man, and finds him to be a kind and sincere person. Luffy was initially annoyed with Sweet Pea for taking his straw hat, but was grateful that she had saved his life and came to like her a lot.

Whilst exploring their jungle, Sweet Pea, along with Marguerite and Aphelandra, came across an unconscious Luffy and carried him back to their village. After mending him back to health, and bathing him, she found out he is a man, shocking her. Luffy managed to escape after being imprisoned by the Kuja Tribe but was eventually captured by Boa Hancock. During his execution, Sweet Pea, along with Marguerite and Aphelandra, were petrified for having aided Luffy. After defeating Hancock's two sisters, Luffy was able to save Sweet Pea and her friends and has since become good friends with her.

Sweet Pea has a good friendship with Luffy and aided him despite not knowing who he was. She worked to remove all the body mushrooms on him and even bathed Luffy alongside Marguerite, at one point mistaking his genitals for another mushroom. Even when she found he was a man, and was fearful of him, she, like the rest of the Kuja women, showed some courtesy towards him despite imprisoning the Straw Hat captain. After the time skip, she was part of the crew that escorted Luffy back to Sabaody Archipelago to reunite with his crew. Nonetheless, she still became hostile when he grew irritated by the clothes provided to him by Marguerite. Despite this, she chose to stand by Marguerite when she stood up for Luffy, which led her to be petrified. She was very thankful towards Luffy for having saved her, and her friend's, lives. Sweet Pea has come to enjoy Luffy's company, as she can be seen smiling whilst partying with him, and was overjoyed at getting to see him again following the Summit War of Marineford.

Luffy first met Sweet Pea when he was imprisoned after the Kuja women discovered he is a man. He was initially annoyed with her for taking his straw hat and used his rubber ability to take it off her, surprising the women there. However, despite being fearful of her ability to use Haki, and for trying to kill him, he was extremely grateful that she stood up for him, alongside Marguerite and Aphelandra, and was furious with Hancock for turning her to stone. Before his fight with the Gorgon sisters, Luffy made sure to move Sweet Pea's body out of the arena so she would be safe. Following the battle, he requested that Hancock turn Sweet Pea back to normal and was happy when she did so. He was very thankful to her, and the rest of the Kuja Pirates, for getting him back to Sabaody following the time skip, bidding them all farewell.

Caribou
Caribou Presses Luffy
Luffy annoyed by Caribou

Caribou originally intended to join Luffy's crew to kill him and his crewmates. After seeing Luffy, Zoro, and Sanji defeat the Kraken with ease, Caribou started to fear Luffy's strength and the Straw Hat Pirate's power in general and offered to become their underling or slave. Luffy, on the other hand, viewed him as an annoyance, barely interacted with him and quickly forgot about him.

After Luffy found him trying to capture Shirahoshi, Luffy indifferently sent Caribou flying out of the palace with a single strike, showing that he did not view Caribou as an actual threat.

Later, Luffy and Caribou met again in the Beast Pirates' prison in the Udon region of Wano Country. Caribou begged Luffy for food and offered to team up with or to become Luffy's slave again to break out of the prison. Luffy did not seem to have any hard feelings about Caribou but he was annoyed by his begging. Luffy was notably able to remember Caribou's name, in spite of the little interaction they had.[88]

After Raizo freed him and they spoke with Luffy, Caribou once more pleaded with him to let him join him. This time, Luffy agreed and Caribou was shocked but hastily accepted Luffy' mercy though stated that he is even more scared of him.[89]

Vander Decken IX
Gomu Gomu no Jet Hammer
Luffy attacks Vander Decken.

Vander Decken IX is the captain of the Flying Pirates and an antagonist during the Fish-Man Island Arc. Both he and Luffy share a completely hostile relationship. Decken despises Luffy, not only for interfering in his attempts to wed Shirahoshi, but for becoming friends with the Mermaid Princess and protecting her from him. Luffy hates Decken for his obsession and constant harassment of Shirahoshi, and commits himself to thwarting all his efforts.

Luffy arrived on Fish-Man Island and befriended Shirahoshi, ironically, by intercepting one of Decken's axes aimed at the princess. This motivated Luffy to become the bodyguard of the Mermaid Princess and become a natural enemy to Decken. He encountered Decken whilst out exploring Fish-Man Island with Shirahoshi and proceeded to beat him up. Decken is later responsible for the giant ship, Noah, falling towards Fish-Man Island which forced Luffy to grievously injure himself when trying to stop it. He was arrested and imprisoned at the end of the Fish-Man Island arc.

Decken hates Luffy with a passion due to having an extreme obsession with Shirahoshi. He was furious to see him with the Mermaid Princess and became frustrated by Luffy's constant intervention whenever he tried to kill her. At one point he threatened to kill him along with Shirahoshi, but was easily beaten by the Straw Hat captain. His defeat at the hands of Luffy, being rejected by Shirahoshi, and Luffy constantly saving her led to him launching Noah at the Mermaid Princess, as well as the whole of Fish-Man Island, with the hope that Luffy would not be able to stop it.

Luffy has a strong dislike for Vander Decken and finds his constant harassment of Shirahoshi completely distasteful. He spent a good portion of his time on Fish-Man Island defending Shirahoshi from his attacks, such as his throwing axes. When Vander Decken finally revealed himself he immediately confronted the fish-man for his attacks on Shirahoshi and brutally slammed him into the ground with his Gomu Gomu no Jet Hammer before escaping with the Mermaid Princess. He continued to defend Shirahoshi from his persistent attacks up until he was finally arrested.

Hody Jones
Luffy Punches Hody Jones
Luffy punches Hody Jones.

Hody Jones is a fish-man, a pirate, the former captain of the New Fish-Man Pirates and a former soldier of the Neptune Army. He was the enemy of Luffy and the Straw Hat Pirates during the Fish-Man Island Arc. The two share a completely hostile relationship, with Hody having a particular obsession with defeating Luffy, something that he maintained even after his defeat to the Straw Hat captain. Luffy hated the fish-man for threatening his friends and for trying to kill Shirahoshi's family. He proceeded to ruthlessly defeat Hody in their fight on Fish-Man Island.

The two met during the Fish-Man Island arc, however, Hody was well aware of who Luffy was well before, as he knew he was the one responsible for Arlong's downfall, someone who he held in high esteem. They would cross paths towards the end of the arc when Hody was about to execute King Neptune before Luffy intervened. The two fought a grueling match with each other until Luffy eventually knocked out the fish-man.

Hody holds a strong hatred for Luffy for defeating his hero, Arlong, and ending the fish-man's ambitions of conquering humans.[90] This hatred for Luffy was so great that it drove him to recklessly take more Energy Steroids that progressively enlarged his muscles but also sent him deeper into a psychotic rage. Due to his arrogance, he was left in shock at seeing Luffy knock out 50,000 of his men with Haoshoku Haki and was frustrated by the difference in power between him and Luffy. Hody had intended to kill Luffy to make an example out of him to the humans on the surface world, however, he completely failed in this endeavor and after his defeat he was imprisoned. He spent the rest of his days demanding Luffy be brought to him for a rematch. Such is his great disdain for the Straw Hat captain, he was willing to fight him again despite the extreme damage and rapid aging done to his body from the steroids he had ingested.[91]

Luffy loathed Hody Jones and was more than willing to worsen the relations between humans and fish-men if it meant defeating him for taking his friends hostage. His anger was further fueled by Hody threatening Shirahoshi, her family, and Fish-Man Island. He found Hody's desire to become Pirate King a challenge and, after using Haoshoku Haki to knockout half of his army, told him that he could become the king of whatever country he wants, but not the Pirate King. He fought Hody Jones and was mostly comfortable taking him on, only struggling once the fight was taken to water, with Hody having a natural advantage and Luffy having a natural weakness, nonetheless, Luffy still defeated the fish-man.

New World Pirates and Crews
Chadros Higelyges
Chadros Higelyges, otherwise known as Brownbeard, was originally an enemy of the Straw Hat Pirates for the first half of the Punk Hazard Arc. He held no particular hatred for Luffy and his crew, but simply resented them out of his admiration and loyalty to Caesar Clown. This loyalty was transferred to Luffy and the Straw Hats once he discovered that Caesar never truly cared about him or his crew. From then on, Brownbeard became a determined ally of the Straw Hats.

Originally, he did fear both Luffy and Zoro as he recognized them as being part of the Worst Generation. He was captured by the Straw Hats and acted as their mode of transport. He initially disliked them, but chose to work with them anyway in order to avoid succumbing to Shinokuni. He slowly began to respect Luffy and was greatly pleased to see Luffy land a final, devastating blow on Caesar.

Luffy is respectful towards Brownbeard, admiring his commitment to his own men. He was greatly angered on Brownbeard's behalf when he found out Caesar had betrayed him and intended to have him killed. This led to Luffy deciding to save Brownbeard. By the end of the arc, Luffy was saddened that Brownbeard had chosen to hand himself over to the Marines, and remarked that he was his friend.

Chinjao
Luffy vs
Luffy and Chinjao at the Corrida Colosseum.

At the beginning of the Dressrosa Arc, Chinjao hated Luffy because he is the grandson of Monkey D. Garp, the one who crushed his pointy head, which acted as a key to his fortunes. He had since hated Garp and transferred this grudge onto Luffy. When he first met Luffy inside the Corrida Colosseum, he tried to attack him and had to be held back by his grandchildren, Sai and Boo. After Luffy restored his pointed head at the end of Block C, Chinjao's enmity towards Luffy had ended.

Chinjao initially thought lowly of Luffy, seeing him as too green like all the other members of the Worst Generation. He dismissed Luffy's goal of becoming Pirate King and surpassing Gol D. Roger. He was nonetheless intrigued, but also annoyed, when he found out that Silvers Rayleigh had trained Luffy in his use of Haki. Such was his disdain for Luffy, he openly mocked Ace's death, angering him. However, once he had allied with Luffy, he had come to respect his strength and abilities, being amazed when Luffy took out Pica's stone head with a punch.

Initially, Luffy is oblivious and confused on why Chinjao disliked him so much. After their match, Luffy was unaware that Chinjao no longer had any ill-will towards him, and when Chinjao tried to thank the Straw Hat captain, he ran away, thinking he was going to attack him. Eventually, Luffy found out that he does not see him as his enemy anymore and accepted his offer to help him take down Doflamingo.

Chinjao feels indebted to Luffy from then on and aids him as much as he can in his fight against Doflamingo and his family. Such is his determination, he wishes to be the one to defeat Doflamingo on Luffy and Usopp's behalf, and gets into an argument with the other pirates Luffy had allied with, as well as Luffy himself. At the end of the arc, he had no objections with his grandchild, Sai, joining the Straw Hat Grand Fleet.

{{Monkey D. Luffy Tabs Top}}
==Overview==
Throughout his childhood, Luffy's aspirations were deeply rooted in the world of piracy. He was greatly influenced by the legends of the [[Four Emperors|Four Pirate Emperors]] of the [[New World]] both old and new and their larger-than-life reputations. Even after creating his [[Straw Hat Pirates|own crew]] and raising his [[Jolly Roger]], Luffy's journey up the hierarchy was heavily shaped by their enduring impact.

The Pirate Emperors themselves and their massive crews would all come to see and acknowledge his potential as a powerful opponent and rival for the title of [[Pirate#Pirate King|Pirate King]] as Luffy and his crew ventured through the treacherous waters of both sides of the Grand Line, drawing ever closer to the Pirate Emperors in terms of power, notoriety, and influence. They were even bestowed with the unofficial title of the "Fifth Emperor of the Sea" after successfully rescuing Sanji from the clutches of [[Charlotte Linlin|Big Mom]]'s territory of [[Totto Land]].

Finally, after his triumph over [[Kaidou]] in the [[Raid on Onigashima]], Luffy became the youngest-ever Emperor of the Sea. His swift ascension to the coveted title solidified his place among the greatest pirate legends of all time and cemented his reputation as one of the most formidable and respected captains in the Great Pirate Quadrant.

==Red Hair Pirates==
[[File:Luffy and Red Hair Pirates.png|thumb|left|250px|Luffy with the Red Hair Pirates.]]

The [[Red Hair Pirates]] are an extremely infamous and powerful crew led by the [[Four Emperors|Emperor]], [[Shanks|Red-Haired Shanks]]. The crew met a young Luffy in his hometown of [[Foosha Village]] where they befriended him. Like their captain, they found Luffy to be endearing, impressive and fun, all sharing the opinion that he will become a great [[pirate]]. Luffy is very fond of the Red Hair Pirates, especially their [[Pirate Captain|chief]], Shanks. He made friends with numerous members of the crew and enjoyed partying with them at [[Foosha Village#Partys Bar|Partys Bar]].

During Luffy's childhood, the Red Hair Pirates arrived in Foosha Village and started attending the local bar where Luffy would spend his days. Throughout their time there they grew close to Luffy and partied with the young boy almost every day. One day, when Luffy was kidnapped by the [[bandit]], [[Higuma]], they followed their captain's led to rescue him, managing to succeed. They were impressed when Luffy stated his intention to form his own crew and become a great pirate that would be stronger than all of them. They all watched gleefully as their captain gave Luffy his precious straw hat as a sign of that promise before sailing away.

The Red Hair Pirates have come to enjoy Luffy's company, some often joking with him about his desire to join their crew, whilst others indulge him, and at one point joined him in his pleas towards Shanks to let him join. However, they dropped their support when Shanks threatened to let Luffy take over one of their spots. Some members would talk to Luffy about their previous life, such as [[Yasopp]], who would talk to Luffy about his own son, [[Usopp]], back in [[Syrup Village]], who would eventually join Luffy's crew. Despite rarely taking him seriously, they all acknowledged his claim to become a great pirate, with the first mate of the crew, [[Benn Beckman]], telling Shanks that Luffy will make it big someday. They all panicked when they realized Luffy ate the [[Gomu Gomu no Mi]], a [[Devil Fruit]] they had found. They all care for Luffy and came to his aid when they found he had been kidnapped by Higuma and searched for him when the bandit managed to escape with Luffy. They all appear to share the same belief as their captain that Luffy will bring a new age of piracy. When they received Luffy's first [[Bounties|bounty]] they all partied in his honor. When they arrived at the [[Summit War of Marineford]], one of the crew's officers, [[Lucky Roux]], asked Shanks if he wanted to see Luffy after ten years, as he was nearby. After Luffy officially joined Shanks among the ranks of the Four Emperors, many of the senior members were excited by the news and wanted to see him again.

Luffy is fond of the Red Hair Pirates like he is with Shanks. He would enjoy being with them in the bar and partied along with all of them. He would occasionally get annoyed when they laughed at him whenever Shanks played a trick on him or when he made an outlandish claim. Nonetheless, he has nothing but happy memories of the Red Hair Pirates and has come to see them as the crew that his own must surpass. He established a friendship with at least three of the crew members, Benn Beckman, Yasopp, and Lucky Roux. He was happy to know that they, and Shanks, are doing well after all these years when he met his [[Monkey D. Garp|grandfather]] in [[Water 7]]. Despite his fondness for them, he was greatly irritated they did not stand up to Higuma when he assaulted their chief, ridiculing them. However, he later came to understand why they chose not to do anything and began sharing the mentality of not fighting over trivial matters. He is also very fond of the song, [[Binks' Sake]], as the Red Hair Pirates would always sing it during their parties.

===Shanks===
<div style="float:right">[[File:Luffy receive the straw hat.png|thumb|180px|Luffy receives Shanks' straw hat.]]</div>

[[Shanks]] is the [[Pirate Captain|chief]] of the [[Red Hair Pirates]], an [[Four Emperors|Emperor]], and a former [[Pirate Apprentice|apprentice]] of the [[Roger Pirates]]. Luffy first met Shanks in his hometown of [[Foosha Village]] when he was seven years old. The two get on extremely well and have equal intrigue and admiration for one another. They both made a promise to each other that they would meet again once Luffy has formed a crew and become a great pirate that has surpassed Shanks. Whilst in Foosha Village, Shanks found Luffy to be an incredible and endearing kid, so much so that he gave him his precious [[Straw Hat#Gol D. Roger/Shanks/Monkey D. Luffy|straw hat]] as a sign of his faith that he will become a great pirate. Luffy looks up to Shanks as a personal hero, believing him to be the ultimate pirate and a great person, and has remained devoted to the promise he made to him back on his home village.

The two share a somewhat comedic relationship, with Luffy always getting frustrated by Shanks' refusal to let him join his crew and for pulling small pranks on him, such as tricking him into drinking juice to prove he is not actually a man. Shanks regularly teases Luffy and likes to joke about some of his claims, rarely taking him seriously. Behind all this, however, lies deep admiration and respect for one another that has survived the test of time, having not met for over ten years but still standing by the commitment they made all the way back in Foosha Village. Shanks is the one that is indirectly responsible for Luffy gaining the powers of the [[Gomu Gomu no Mi]] after he left it unattended next to Luffy who unwittingly ate the [[Devil Fruit]]. However, this ultimately proved to be a boon for Luffy as his fighting style became much more dynamic and formidable thanks to eating the Devil Fruit.

Shanks has become extremely intrigued by Luffy and believes him to be destined for greatness. Before leaving Foosha Village, Shanks was greatly impressed after hearing Luffy's resounding statement that he would become a pirate on his own, form his own crew, and surpass them all to become the [[Pirate#Pirate King|Pirate King]]. He thus decided to leave Luffy his straw hat as a sign of his faith in him to fulfill this dream. This was a monumental gesture on Shanks' part as the straw hat is of high sentimental value to him having originally been worn by [[Gol D. Roger]], his former captain. His [[First Mate|first mate]], [[Benn Beckman]], commented to him that Luffy is going to make it big one day with Shanks agreeing. It appears that Shanks is betting everything on Luffy becoming the future of piracy and when talking to his fellow Emperor, and former adversary, [[Edward Newgate|Whitebeard]], he took pride in having given up his left arm for Luffy, simply telling him that he bet it on a new age. Although never outwardly stated, it's apparent that Shanks sees a lot of his old captain, Gol D. Roger, in Luffy and has gone around spreading Luffy's name to various major figures in the world, such as [[Dracule Mihawk]] and [[Silvers Rayleigh]]. He was overjoyed when Mihawk delivered Luffy's first [[Bounties#Identification|wanted poster]] to him and celebrated Luffy's success. He appeared somewhat disappointed that he could not meet Luffy when he arrived at the [[Summit War of Marineford]] but acknowledged that it was still too soon. He keeps track of Luffy's progress and could not help but give a big smile when reading that Luffy was now considered the ''fifth'' Emperor of the seas and again when Luffy officially enters the Emperor ranks by defeating Kaidou.

{{Cquote|He has connections with Red-Haired Shanks?|2=Robin's reaction to finding out that Luffy knows Shanks{{Qref|name=Red|chap=432|page=6-7|ep=314}}}}

[[File:Shanks Saves Luffy.png|thumb|left|250px|Shanks saves Luffy at the cost of his left arm.]]

Shanks cares very much for Luffy's well-being. When Luffy stabbed himself under the eye he panicked and got him some immediate medical help. He became distress when he realized Luffy had eaten the Gomu Gomu no Mi and tried to force him to spit it out as it would take away his ability to swim. When Luffy was taken captive by [[Higuma]] he confronted the [[bandit]] and quickly defeated his underlings, but became frantic when he suddenly disappeared with Luffy. When Luffy was about to be eaten by [[Lord of the Coast]] he dived in to save him at the cost of his left arm, but was not at all upset, simply stating that it was just an arm and that it is more important that he is alive. When he arrived at the Summit War of Marineford he thanked [[Koby]] for his speech that managed to bring everybody on the battlefield to a standstill long enough for him to arrive and allow Luffy to escape. He also found his former straw hat and bribed [[Buggy]] to return it to Luffy. Following the Summit War of Marineford, he acknowledged the pain that Luffy must be going through at the loss of his brother, [[Portgas D. Ace|Ace]].

Luffy has extremely high admiration for Shanks and, more so than anybody else, he is responsible for Luffy's dream to become the Pirate King. His admiration for Shanks began when he first met him as a kid, eagerly wanting to join his crew and even stabbed himself underneath his eye just to prove he is tough enough to become a pirate, which got him his first notable scar. After Higuma assaulted Shanks he became upset with him for just laughing it off instead of fighting back and lost some of his admiration for the pirate captain. However, when Higuma returned to the [[Foosha Village#Partys Bar|bar]] he ridiculed the bandit for insulting Shanks, despite the risk to his own life. When his grandfather, [[Monkey D. Garp]], also insulted Shanks he came to his defense in spite of the fear he has for him. Luffy is very fond of Shanks and, by extension, is very fond of the straw hat he gave him, referring to it as his one and only treasure. He often becomes angry when someone damages his hat, such as when Buggy sliced through it, and rarely likes other people holding on to it save for [[Nami]] and occasionally one or two others. He is determined to return the straw hat Shanks gave him when he becomes a great pirate and has held on to it for this reason. He was glad to hear some news about Shanks from his grandfather when he met him on [[Water 7]]{{Qref|name=Red}} and was amazed to find out that he used to be a member of the Roger Pirates.{{Qref|chap=506|ep=400}}

Despite his admiration for him, Luffy has clearly stated that he wishes to fight Shanks one day when he told [[Trafalgar D. Water Law|Trafalgar Law]] that he will defeat every Emperor, knowing full well that includes Shanks. However, when he formed his alliance with Law to take down an Emperor, he was only willing to do so as long as the target was not Shanks as he wishes to save him for last.{{Qref|chap=696|page=19|ep=622}}

It appears that Luffy has sought to emulate Shanks' style as a captain. He is just as laid back as Shanks and enjoys partying as much as he does. Shanks' statement about not taking offence to trivial incidents like spilling drinks or being spat on also influenced Luffy, as when Ace spat on him the first time, they met he simply brushed it off after he reminded himself of what Shanks once said. It also appears this was the mindset he had when dealing with [[Bellamy]] on [[Jaya]], as he chose not to fight back against him as he believed it was not worth the effort. Shanks' belief that you must protect your friends at all costs clearly resonated with Luffy, as he has gone above and beyond to protect everyone who he considers a friend and prioritizes them before anything else. He once repeated a quote Shanks made, back when he saved him from a group of bandits, to [[Usopp]] when they first met in [[Syrup Village]] after he tried to intimidate him. When he recruited [[Brook]] into his crew he was very fond of his rendition of [[Binks' Sake]] because it was a song Shanks and his crew would always sing. After arriving on [[Sabaody Archipelago]], and meeting Rayleigh, he became unusually embarrassed when he found out Shanks spoke highly of him.{{Qref|chap=506}}

===Benn Beckman===
[[File:Benn Beckman Reassures Luffy.png|thumb|250px|Luffy talks to Benn Beckman.]]

[[Benn Beckman]] is the [[First Mate|first mate]] to the [[Four Emperors|Emperor]], [[Shanks]], and an officer of the [[Red Hair Pirates]]. He, like his chief and crew, are very fond of Luffy after meeting him in [[Foosha Village]]. He often tries to reassure Luffy whenever he gets upset with Shanks and reminds him of what his actual intentions are. Luffy respects Beckman and will listen to what he has to say even though he can disagree with him.

When the Red Hair Pirates landed in Foosha Village they all quickly befriended Luffy, including Beckman. They would spend their time drinking inside [[Foosha Village#Partys Bar|Partys Bar]] and have a good time with Luffy. He came to Luffy's aid, alongside his captain, when he had been taken captive by the [[bandit]], [[Higuma]]. He watched on with a smile when, before they left, Luffy proudly declared his goal of becoming the [[Pirate#Pirate King|Pirate King]].

Much like his captain, Shanks, he has a lot of faith and belief in Luffy becoming a great [[pirate]]. When Luffy declared his goal to Shanks, and the rest of the crew, he commented to his captain that Luffy will make it big someday. Which came true as following the [[Wano Country Arc]] Luffy is now considered to be an [[Four Emperors|Emperor]] like his chief. He also cares for Luffy and would take the time to reassure him that Shanks is only looking out for his well-being when he rejects him from his crew. When Luffy was taken by Higuma, he joined his captain in fighting against them and easily defeated the majority of Higuma's bandit group. At the [[Summit War of Marineford]], Beckman held [[Admiral]] [[Borsalino|Kizaru]] at gun point before he could try and attack Luffy as he escaped in [[Trafalgar D. Water Law|Trafalgar Law]]'s [[Polar Tang|submarine]].

Luffy respects Benn Beckman highly and appreciates his sobering explanation of why Shanks rejects him when he wants to join his crew, and for not taking him seriously, despite disagreeing with him and still getting frustrated when Shanks mocks him. He tends to complain about Shanks to Beckman whenever his chief taunts him. After he was saved by Beckman, and the rest of the Red Hair Pirates, he was appreciative of what he had done. He said his goodbyes to Beckman, as well as Shanks and the crew, in tears after he declared his intention of becoming the Pirate King.

===Yasopp===
[[Yasopp]] is the [[sniper]] and an officer of the [[Red Hair Pirates]]. He, like his chief and crew, are very fond of Luffy after meeting him at [[Foosha Village]]. Yasopp's shooting skills often amazed Luffy, and the latter would be the subject to Yasopp's tales of his son who was Luffy's age.

It was from these stories that Luffy had no problem identifying Usopp as Yasopp's son in their first meeting and became friends with him.

===Uta===
[[File:Uta's Past Arc.png|thumb|left|250px|Uta and Luffy as kids]]

[[Uta]] is the adopted daughter of Shanks and is a former member of his crew, she was one of the three [[Musician]]s of the Crew alongside [[Bonk Punch]] and [[Monster]]. When Uta was 9, the Red Hair Pirates set up a base at Foosha Village in the East Blue. Very soon after landing, Uta met a 7-year-old boy named [[Monkey D. Luffy]] who she did not think much of. Uta demonstrated her singing talents at the Partys Bar, to great acclaim. Afterwards, Shanks had Luffy show Uta around the village and surrounding island. Uta and Luffy's clashing personalities caused them to get into many competitions, but a friendship started developing between them as Uta told Luffy about the Red Hair Pirates, which the boy was interested in joining. Luffy took Uta to the top of a windmill to see the sun set over the coast, and it was there when Uta began dreaming of performing a concert for the entire world.{{Qref|name=c1030|ep=1030}} 

Some days later, after the duo raced on boats and encountered the [[Lord of the Coast]], Uta and Luffy were on a coastal cliff. There, Uta told Luffy her dream of using her music to create a "new genesis" in the world. Later, the Red Hair Pirates prepared to make a temporary voyage out to sea. Luffy attempted to stow away with them, but Uta caught him resulting in his removal. Uta told Luffy to get stronger while she was away and that she would test him upon her return. However, Uta would not make the return trip as she and Shanks would part ways at some point in the voyage, with Shanks only saying cryptically to Luffy later on that she had left to pursue a career as a singer. which very much had made him upset with Shanks for a while.{{Qref|name=e1030|ep=1030}} now she is currently known as "'''Diva"''' and also is a [[world]]-famous [[Musician|singer]], she became popular as a diva after her breakout hit, "New Genesis", became popular. Since then, she had increased her fame by "streaming" her songs and dances worldwide via [[Den Den Mushi#Visual-Based Variants|Den Den Mushi]]. When he and his crew attend Uta's concert in [[Elegia]], Luffy went on stage to reunite with her.

Uta was delighted to see him again and reminisces their joyful past together. However, after Luffy declared he wanted to become Pirate King, Uta showed her disdain for pirates and attempted to convince Luffy to quit being a [[pirate]] and join her in the New Genesis.{{Qref|[https://www.onepiece-film.jp/en/info-en/149/ "Character visuals of the mysterious girl have arrived, and advance ticket sales begin on Friday, April 15!"]. One Piece Film: Red Official Site.}} However, after seeing his determination in saving her fans and herself from Tot Musica, she regained respect for her friend and told him that she believed in his dream to become the Pirate King.

After Luffy woke up on Thousand Sunny with his crew when they departed Elegia, he noticed the Red-Hair Pirates' ship sailing away, and looked on at the crew standing over a coffin. Presumably aware of Uta's fate, Luffy gave a silent solemn expression.{{Qref|movie=15}}

==Whitebeard Pirates==
[[File:Whitebeard Pirates Rally to Protect Luffy.png|thumb|250px|The Whitebeard Pirates rally to protect Luffy from Akainu.]]

The [[Whitebeard Pirates]] were an extremely infamous and powerful crew led by the late former [[Four Emperors|Emperor]], [[Edward Newgate|Whitebeard]]. They all met Luffy for the first time during the [[Summit War of Marineford]] and allied with him to save his brother, and their Second Division Commander, [[Portgas D. Ace|Ace]]. They were universally impressed by Luffy's tenacity and determination and offered their aid as best they could. Luffy holds the Whitebeard Pirates in high regard for their help during the Summit War of Marineford and wishes to thank them for it.

When Luffy arrived at the Summit War of Marineford he quickly won over their [[Pirate Captain|captain]], Whitebeard, who recognized him as an ally to save Ace. Throughout the battle the Whitebeard Pirates saved Luffy from powerful foes and followed his lead across the battlefield. Following Ace's death, their top priority was to save Luffy from [[Admiral]] [[Sakazuki|Akainu]], as ordered by their captain, Whitebeard.

The Whitebeard Pirates came to respect Luffy highly. Their First Division Commander, [[Marco]], praised Luffy after he intercepted [[Crocodile]]'s attack on Whitebeard. [[Jozu]], the Third Division Commander, was impressed by Luffy's defiant response to Ace's pleas. The Fifth Division Commander, [[Vista|Flower Sword Vista]], saved Luffy from [[Dracule Mihawk]] and sliced two cannon balls that were aimed at him. Near the end of the battle, the entire crew (including Whitebeard) was shocked to learn Luffy is able to use Haoshoku Haki. The entire crew followed their captain's order to follow Luffy across the battlefield and allowed him to lead their attack. By the end of the battle, whilst still distraught over Ace's death, they rallied together under Marco to protect Luffy from Admiral Akainu, recognizing him as all that remains of Ace's spirit and wanting to make sure Ace's sacrifice was not in vain.

Luffy was very grateful for the aid the Whitebeard Pirates offered him, but was dominantly preoccupied with trying to reach Ace to acknowledge many of them at the time. Following the time skip, he was shocked and saddened at the revelation that they were defeated by the [[Blackbeard Pirates]] and wished to thank them for saving him when he fell unconscious after Ace's death.

===Edward Newgate===
[[File:Luffy's Declaration to Whitebeard.png|thumb|left|250px|Luffy declares he'll become Pirate King to Whitebeard.]]

[[Edward Newgate]], otherwise known as Whitebeard, was the [[Pirate Captain|captain]] of the [[Whitebeard Pirates]], a former [[Four Emperors|Emperor]], and a former member of the [[Rocks Pirates]]. The two met during the [[Summit War of Marineford]] and, although their time was short, had come to respect each other. Whitebeard was impressed by Luffy's performance and sheer determination to save [[Portgas D. Ace|Ace]] and went so far as to order his entire crew to follow his lead. Despite an initial, intense, confrontation, Luffy understood the extreme power Whitebeard possessed and how important he was to Ace. He was very appreciative of him, and his crew's, efforts to help him save Ace.

During the Summit War of Marineford, the two came into contact with each other after Luffy stopped [[Crocodile]]'s attempt to kill Whitebeard. After noticing Luffy, Whitebeard asked him about his straw hat, recognizing that it once belonged to [[Shanks]], and tried to discourage Luffy from partaking in the conflict but was won over by his defiant attitude towards him. The two then formed an impromptu alliance and decided to compete to save Ace. Throughout the battle, Luffy indirectly led the charge to save Ace whilst Whitebeard offered up as much support as he could muster from his crew to help the Straw Hat captain.

Whitebeard had heard of Luffy well before the events at [[Marineford]] after Ace informed him that Luffy is his brother after he got his first [[Bounties|bounty]]. Luffy piqued Whitebeard's curiosity when he noticed the straw hat he was wearing and recalled the conversation he had with Shanks about how he lost his left arm, realizing that Shanks gave it up for Luffy. It appears that he was determined not to have Luffy fight in the battle, possibly to protect him for Ace's sake, and thus tried to bluntly discourage him. However, he accepted him as an ally after he was impressed by his bravery to back talk him and fully state his intention to become the [[Pirate#Pirate King|Pirate King]].

Throughout the Summit War of Marineford, Whitebeard was continuously impressed by Luffy's determination to save Ace. He told his First Division Commander, [[Marco]], not to let Luffy die and that he would not forgive him if he failed. When Luffy had managed to clear the barrier and land into the plaza before anyone else he smiled at Luffy's success and enacted the next stage of his plan to follow his lead. He, at one point, commented with delight that he is just as reckless as his brother. When Admiral [[Borsalino|Kizaru]] overwhelmed Luffy in their fight, he caught the Straw Hat captain, who was now exhausted, and put him down to get medical attention. He witnessed Luffy unleash his [[Haki/Haoshoku Haki|Haoshoku Haki]] just as Ace was about to be executed and was left in complete disbelief. He then ordered his own crew to follow Luffy's lead and personally aided his attempt to reach Ace's platform by frustrating Admiral Kizaru's efforts to stop him. He was pleased when he saw Luffy had managed to free Ace. Before the end of his life, in his final words to [[Marshall D. Teach|Blackbeard]] and [[Sengoku]], it is implied that he believes Luffy is the person [[Gol D. Roger]] has been waiting for and that he will be the one to find [[One Piece]].

Luffy had first heard of Whitebeard back in [[Arabasta]] when he reunited with Ace, who was now a high-ranking member of his crew, and offered him to join but Luffy immediately refused. When he first met him, he wished to protect Whitebeard from Crocodile as he was an important person to Ace, however, he was not happy when Whitebeard talked down to him and angrily told the Emperor to shut up whilst boldly telling him that he would be the one to become the Pirate King. Having earned Whitebeard's respect, he worked alongside him to save Ace and informed him about the execution time being moved forward. He was grateful to Whitebeard for aiding him throughout the Summit War of Marineford as a few of his crew members saved him numerous times. Although, he did tell [[Emporio Ivankov|Ivankov]] that he has no desire to impress Whitebeard or live up to his expectations as he only wishes to save Ace. Luffy did not witness Whitebeard's last moments, as he had fallen unconscious from the shock of Ace's death, but he remembers the Whitebeard Pirates and their captain fondly.

===Marco===
[[File:Marco vs. Kuzan.png|thumb|250px|Marco saves Luffy from Aokiji.]]

[[Marco]] is the former First Division Commander of the now disbanded [[Whitebeard Pirates]], the former right-hand man of the late former [[Four Emperors|Emperor]], [[Edward Newgate|Whitebeard]], and an ally to Luffy. Marco and Luffy met for the first time at the [[Summit War of Marineford]]. Like his captain, he took a quick shinning to Luffy, finding him to be a very impressive [[pirate]] and soon came to respect him. Luffy, although rarely interacting with him, was able to remember Marco from the Summit War of Marineford and recognized him as a friendly guy and a helpful ally when he tried to save [[Portgas D. Ace|Ace]]. The two reunited in [[Wano Country]] where Marco arrived to aid in the successful [[Raid on Onigashima]] that saw [[Kaidou]] and [[Charlotte Linlin|Big Mom]]'s downfall.

Whilst Luffy was ignorant on Marco, the first division commander of the Whitebeard Pirates was fully aware of who Luffy was from the many times his brother, Ace, fondly spoke of him.{{Qref|chap=557}} The first impression Marco got of Luffy was shortly after he arrived at [[Marineford]] when he saw the young pirate intercept [[Crocodile]]'s attempt to kill Whitebeard. Marco took note of this and praised Luffy, commenting "he is not half bad".{{Qref|chap=557}} Marco, under orders from Whitebeard, was tasked to make sure Luffy does not die, something Marco gladly accepted doing.{{Qref|chap=558}} His attempts to protect Luffy became a big focus throughout the Battle of Marineford. He ordered his fellow Division Commanders to defend Luffy, such as [[Vista|Flower Sword Vista]] who intercepted [[Dracule Mihawk|Mihawk]]'s attacks on Luffy.{{Qref|chap=561}} He, himself, came to the aid of Luffy when Admiral [[Kuzan|Aokiji]] attempted to attack Luffy as well.{{Qref|chap=566}} He succeeded in this quest after he and his crew mates held off Admiral [[Sakazuki|Akainu]]{{Qref|chap=575}} long enough for [[Jinbei]] and Luffy to escape with the [[Heart Pirates]].{{Qref|chap=578}} Following his failed [[Payback War|attempt]]{{Qref|chap=773}} to defeat the [[Blackbeard Pirates]], he has been working as a doctor on [[Sphinx (Location)|Sphinx]], the home village of his late captain, Whitebeard. However, he has sent out a message for Luffy to receive.{{Qref|chap=909}}

It appears that Marco has come to take a great intrigue in Luffy, like many others. He first realized Luffy's potential when he was left stunned when the Straw Hat captain unintentionally used [[Haki/Haoshoku Haki|Haoshoku Haki]] to stop the attempted execution of Ace.{{Qref|chap=569}} Following Ace's death, he composed himself in order to rally the Whitebeard Pirates to save Luffy, reminding them that Ace sacrificed himself for Luffy{{Qref|chap=575}} and firmly told Admiral Akainu that he would not let him kill Ace's brother.{{Qref|chap=578}} Following the time skip, Marco was visited by [[Nekomamushi]], who had allied with Luffy as part of the [[Ninja-Pirate-Mink-Samurai Alliance]], and asked him to pass on a message to the Straw Hat captain.{{Qref|name=c909|chap=909|ep=890}} His admiration compelled him to partake in the Raid on Onigashima to take down Kaidou,{{Qref|chap=982}} something that Ace himself also wished for,{{Qref|chap=999}} and played a key role in hindering Big Mom,{{Qref|chap=981}} [[Charlotte Perospero]],{{Qref|chap=992}} [[King]] and [[Queen]].{{Qref|chap=999}} At one point, he protects and tries to reassure [[Nami]] and [[Kurozumi Tama|Tama]] when they become distraught at the possibility of Luffy's demise.{{Qref|chap=1043}} When he saw Luffy's transformation into [[Nika]], he could do naught but look up in amazement.{{Qref|chap=1044}}

Luffy rarely interacted with Marco during the Summit War of Marineford. However, he was grateful for his help and briefly thanked him when Marco saved him from Admiral Aokiji.{{Qref|chap=566}} Following the time skip, he had forgotten Marco's name and had to be reminded by [[Nico Robin|Robin]] who he was by reminding the captain that he looks like a pineapple.{{Qref|chap=820}} Nonetheless, he acknowledged how strong he was during the war and is well aware what Marco had done for him. He wants to meet him again and thank the former First Division Commander for all he had done for him during the battle, and ultimately saving his life from Admiral Akainu after he had fallen unconscious.{{Qref|name=c820|chap=820|page=12-15|ep=773|The Ninja-Pirate-Mink-Samurai Alliance speak of Marco.}}

==Blackbeard Pirates==
[[File:Luffy Confronted by The Blackbeard Pirates.png|thumb|left|250px|Luffy and his makeshift crew are confronted by the Blackbeard Pirates whilst in Impel Down.]]

The [[Blackbeard Pirates]] are an extremely notorious and powerful crew led by the [[Four Emperors|Emperor]], [[Marshall D. Teach|Blackbeard]]. They share an antagonistic relationship with Luffy but the two have yet to truly clash. However, it is apparent that Blackbeard and his crew view Luffy as their enemy, with Luffy sharing the sentiment. Although the Blackbeard Pirates do not seem to harbor any serious hatred or dislike towards Luffy, they will antagonize the Straw Hat captain whenever they cross paths. Luffy strongly dislikes the Blackbeard Pirates for their role in [[Portgas D. Ace|Ace]]'s death, for defeating the [[Whitebeard Pirates]] during the time skip and for their attack on the [[Revolutionary Army]].

Whilst on [[Jaya]], Luffy unknowingly met a member of the Blackbeard Pirates, [[Doc Q]], who he helped get back on his horse, [[Stronger]]. Doc Q then fed Luffy an explosive apple, but it proved to be a dud and rode off. Luffy then witnessed [[Jesus Burgess]], another member of the Blackbeard Pirates, stand atop a building and shout for a decent challenge. He finally met their captain, Blackbeard, inside the [[Mock Town#Wild Cherry|Wild Cherry]] and got into a dispute with him over cherry pie. After being on the receiving end of Blackbeard's impassioned speech about dreams, he sailed off to try and reach [[Skypiea]], not knowing the Blackbeard Pirates were now after him after they had discovered his [[Bounties|bounty]]. They would cross paths again inside [[Impel Down]], with Luffy now being fully aware of who they are, and briefly fought Blackbeard before they went their separate ways. Luffy met Burgess again whilst in [[Dressrosa]] when he was competing for the [[Mera Mera no Mi]] and briefly talked with Blackbeard over a [[Den Den Mushi]].

What the Blackbeard Pirates, as a whole, think of Luffy has never been fully revealed due to the few interactions they have had with Luffy and his crew, however, they have shown themselves to be quite antagonistic towards him like they are with most people they meet. Originally, the Blackbeard Pirates chose Luffy as their target to hand over to the [[World Government]] in order for their captain to become a member of the [[Seven Warlords of the Sea|Seven Warlords]], but settled on Ace. They seem to acknowledge Luffy and the Straw Hats as a rival crew as a lot of them have kept up to date with their exploits. Like their captain, they seem to share the opinion that Luffy is "fated", noting that he was lucky that Ace unwittingly took his place as their prize for the World Government. On their first meeting, Doc Q openly tried to kill Luffy with his explosive apples but noted that Luffy is a very fortuitous person and believes Luffy to be guided by fate. Burgess was excited to find out that Luffy was competing with him to win the Mera Mera no Mi and laughed at his claim that he would stop them winning Ace's [[Devil Fruit]]. He later tried to kill Luffy when he was exhausted from his use of [[Gomu Gomu no Mi/Gear 4 Techniques|Gear 4]] against [[Donquixote Doflamingo|Doflamingo]], not out of malice, but out of the desire to collect his Devil Fruit, the [[Gomu Gomu no Mi]]. Fortunately, [[Sabo]] intervenes on behalf of his brother.

Luffy strongly dislikes the Blackbeard Pirates, especially their [[Admiral (Fleet Captain)|Admiral]] Blackbeard. He puts a lot of blame on Blackbeard for his role in Ace's death, having captured him and handed him over to the World Government and has fought against Blackbeard directly, whilst in Impel Down, due to what he did. He cursed them when he discovered that the Blackbeard Pirates had defeated the Whitebeard Pirates in the [[Payback War]]. He was irritated when he discovered that Burgess was competing for his late brother's Devil Fruit and grew more irritated at his and Blackbeard's taunts. His hatred for them grew when he discovered they had attacked the Revolutionary Army's headquarters, [[Baltigo]], where his father and sworn brother, [[Sabo]], are based.

===Marshall D. Teach===
[[File:Luffy and Blackbeard.png|thumb|250px|Luffy and Blackbeard.]]

[[Marshall D. Teach]], otherwise known as Blackbeard, is the [[Admiral (Fleet Captain)|Admiral]] of the [[Blackbeard Pirates]], an [[Four Emperors|Emperor]], a former [[Seven Warlords of the Sea|Warlord]], a former member of the [[Whitebeard Pirates]] and one of Luffy's sworn archenemies besides [[Sakazuki|Akainu]]. In a lot of ways, Teach is a dark reflection of Luffy as they have similar personalities in terms of insatiable appetite, cheerful disposition and being a staunch believer in fate and dreams, but Teach sees them as cut blanche to do whatever he wants and he is much more selfish, cruel and deceitful than Luffy.

Blackbeard seems to hold a lot of respect for Luffy and recognizes him for his fierce determination to achieve his dream, whilst also having an openly antagonistic relationship with him. Luffy, however, utterly loathes Blackbeard and puts a large portion of blame on him for [[Portgas D. Ace|Ace]]'s death. His hatred grew even further when Blackbeard attacked his father, [[Monkey D. Dragon]] and his brother, [[Sabo]].

The first two met on [[Jaya]], inside the [[Mock Town#Wild Cherry|Wild Cherry]], where they had a comedic disagreement over the quality of the cherry pie there and almost got into a fight before Blackbeard decided to leave.  After Luffy's confrontation with [[Bellamy]] over following one's dreams, he was dragged out of the bar by [[Nami]]. Blackbeard was sat outside, whilst eating his cherry pies, and praised Luffy's decision not to fight back against Bellamy back on Jaya, informing Nami that Luffy had actually won that fight despite not having not fought back at all. He then gave an impassioned speech to Luffy about dreams never dying, knowing full well Luffy understood his sentiment.  Even though he acknowledges Luffy as a fellow dreamer, he still believes that piracy is a dog-eat-dog world and fully intended to capture Luffy as he sailed off to [[Skypiea]] after finding out about his increased [[Bounties|bounty]] but failed due to a perfectly timed [[Knock Up Stream]]. The two would meet again during [[Impel Down Arc]], where Blackbeard revealed he was the one behind Ace's arrest. When Blackbeard mocked Luffy about how Ace was going to be killed because he protected Luffy from Blackbeard, Luffy went to a complete rage. During the brief skirmish Teach admitted he underestimated Luffy, as when he fought the Straw Hat captain, he was surprised at just how strong he actually was. Luffy would have continued their duel but Jinbe reminded hm it was more important to get out of [[Impel Down]] and reach [[Marineford]] were Ace was to which Luffy reluctantly agreed and departed. Since then, Luffy and Blackbeard have somewhat kept up to date on each other's activities.

Two years later. Luffy talked to Blackbeard whilst in [[Dressrosa]] over a Den Den Mushi where he became angered when Teach proclaimed the Blackbeard Partes would claim the [[Mera Mera no Mi]], but Luffy swore his late brother's power would not become theirs. Whilst on his way to [[Totto Land]], he was angry to read that Blackbeard and his crew had attacked the [[Baltigo|headquarters]] of the [[Revolutionary Army]], and worried for his father's and Sabo's safety.{{Qref|chap=824|ep=779}}

===Kuzan===
[[File:Luffy and Aokiji.png|thumb|left|250px|Luffy and Aokiji.]]

[[Kuzan]], otherwise known as Aokiji, is a former [[Admiral]] of the [[Marines]] and an member of the [[Blackbeard Pirates]]. He is a minor antagonist to Luffy during the [[Long Ring Long Land Arc]] and a major antagonist during the [[Summit War of Marineford]]. Aokiji seems to have a begrudging respect for Luffy and is impressed by his leadership qualities and fighting abilities, as well as his tenacity. Luffy seems to respect Aokiji's strength but is often hostile around him due to him being a Marine Admiral and for trying to take [[Nico Robin]] from him and his crew.

The two first meet on [[Long Ring Long Land]] and start off rather cordial. However, Aokiji's mood changes at the sight of Robin and ultimately decides to fight the [[Straw Hat Pirates|Straw Hats]]. Luffy was able to save his crew but was completely frozen by Aokiji, but was spared by the Admiral. He would encounter him again during the Summit War of Marineford and got into a brief fight with Aokiji before being saved by [[Marco]]. Aokiji attempted to stop [[Jinbe]] and [[Trafalgar D. Water Law|Trafalgar Law]] carrying Luffy away from the battlefield but ultimately failed.

Aokiji seems to respect Luffy the most out of all the Admirals. He acknowledges his tenacity and leadership skills, praising him for his decision to challenge him to a one-on-one duel instead of risking his entire crew against him. When he defeated him, he chose to spare his life as a way to thank the Straw Hat captain for defeating [[Crocodile]] back in [[Arabasta Kingdom|Arabasta]], but also because he owed a favor to Luffy's grandfather, [[Monkey D. Garp|Garp]]. However, during the Summit War of Marineford, he was more than prepared to kill Luffy despite his debt to his grandfather. He aggressively pursued Luffy when he was being carried by Jinbe to safety and continued his pursuit to Trafalgar Law's [[Polar Tang|submarine]], but ultimately failed to stop him getting away.

He seems to have a desire to test Luffy's determination to protect Robin, who he has a history with. He was impressed by Luffy's infiltration of [[Enies Lobby]] to rescue Robin and ultimately defeating [[CP9]], commenting that he, and his crew, have passed his test and accepted the devastation Luffy had caused as a complete and utter defeat for the [[Marines]]. He was greatly amused when he watched Luffy escape Garp on his new ship, the [[Thousand Sunny]], by launching into the sky from [[Water 7]]. He next witnessed Luffy fall from the sky during the Summit War of Marineford and marveled at the makeshift crew he had managed to put together after escaping [[Impel Down]]. When Luffy managed to clear the wall and land right in front of him and his fellow Admirals, he was impressed but bluntly informed Luffy that he was not ready for this stage yet. He was left completely stunned, and appeared to be sweating, at the sight of Luffy unleashing his [[Haki/Haoshoku Haki|Haoshoku Haki]]. He was amused by Luffy ringing the [[Ox Bell]] at [[Marineford]] and speculated what his intentions were.

Luffy has only known Aokiji as a formidable threat that he must be wary of. Despite their initial positive start, he became hostile once he realized who Aokiji was and his intentions against his crew mate, Robin. He was startled when the Admiral revealed to him that he knows his grandfather. He is well aware of Aokiji's incredible power and decided to take the full brunt of his attacks whilst his crew escape, earning Aokiji's praise. Luffy's fight with Aokiji was a watershed experience for Luffy, having taken the defeat as a sign of things to come and thus worked to push his body to its limits and ultimately become stronger, this eventually led to him attaining [[Gomu Gomu no Mi/Gear 2 Techniques|Gear 2]] and [[Gomu Gomu no Mi/Gear 3 Techniques|Gear 3]]. When he cleared the wall during the Summit War of Marineford he remained unfazed when he was confronted by Aokiji and his fellow Admirals, instead he tried to take full advantage of him freezing the ship mast he had thrown at them by smashing it up to create a thick mist to then try and jump right past him. When Jinbe informed him of Aokiji leaving the Marines after he lost his fight to his fellow Admiral, Akainu, for the position of [[Marine Ranks#Fleet Admiral|Fleet Admiral]], he was visibly surprised. Luffy is currently unaware that Aokiji is now a member of Blackbeard's crew.

==Big Mom Pirates==
[[File:Enraged Army.png|thumb|250px|The Enraged Army led by officers of the Big Mom Pirates sent out to capture Luffy.]]

The [[Big Mom Pirates]] are an extremely infamous and powerful crew led by the former [[Four Emperors|Emperor]], [[Charlotte Linlin|Big Mom]]. Both Luffy and the Big Mom Pirates dislike each other a lot and have clashed with each other numerous times. The Big Mom Pirates dislike Luffy for his defiance towards their [[Pirate Captain|captain]], Big Mom, and for the chaos he caused on [[Whole Cake Island]]. Luffy dislikes the Big Mom Pirates, dominantly their captain, for trying to take away [[Sanji]] from his crew and for being prone to violence against people he cares for, such as the people of [[Fish-Man Island]].

Luffy and the Big Mom Pirates had their first encounter on Fish-Man Island when [[Pekoms]] and [[Tamago]] threatened the island after it could not offer up candy for Big Mom. Luffy confronted them and had his first interaction with Big Mom, who he threatened and proceeded to claim Fish-Man Island from. Big Mom and her crew were vexed by Luffy and pursued him as soon as he entered the [[New World]], forcing his [[Straw Hat Pirates|crew]] to separate whilst they were on [[Dressrosa]]. Big Mom then had [[Capone Bege]] blackmail Sanji, a member of the [[Vinsmoke Family]], into becoming a pawn in her Vinsmoke assassination plan to steal the Germa cloning technology. This led to Luffy infiltrating their territory, [[Totto Land]], where he wreaked havoc and retrieved Sanji. Embarrassed, the Big Mom Pirates have pursued Luffy to [[Wano Country|Wano]] with the intent to kill him.

The Big Mom Pirates despise Luffy for varying reasons. Foremost is because he defied Big Mom who they obediently serve. But also, for causing pandemonium on Whole Cake Island when he gate crashed the wedding of Sanji and [[Charlotte Pudding]] to foil Big Mom's Vinsmoke and attempted to assassinate Big Mom.{{Qref|name=Big Father|chap=868|page=12-17|ep=838|ep2=839}} Their hatred for him grew when, after defeating [[Charlotte Cracker]], he also defeated [[Charlotte Katakuri]], who they idolize and worship as the center piece of their family, besides Big Mom. This has incurred the absolute wrath of notable officers of the Big Mom Pirates, such as [[Charlotte Oven]], who is Katakuri's triplet brother, who desired to personally kill Luffy for what he did. Such is this immense hatred, many of them willingly chose to accompany their captain to Wano despite it being a rival Emperor's territory in her pursuit of the Straw Hat captain.

Due to being led by an Emperor, they are extremely arrogant and egotistical, and because of this they find Luffy's defiance insulting. They look down on Luffy and his crew as nothing more than rookie pirates from the [[Worst Generation]]. It's because of this attitude they found it inconceivable that Luffy was not only able to cause so much mayhem for them, but also defeat their most prized member, Katakuri, leaving almost every major member of the Big Mom Pirates completely stunned. Many of them outright denied the possibility he had defeated Katakuri, and instead tried to claim he cheated, somehow, despite their sister, [[Charlotte Brûlée]], confirming that Luffy had indeed won.{{Qref|chap=898}} Some members of the Big Mom Pirates have come to acknowledge Luffy's abilities whilst others have made friends with him, such as Charlotte Pudding and Pekoms. In the case of Charlotte Katakuri, he views Luffy as a respected adversary and was pleased when he heard that Luffy had escaped.

Luffy dislikes the Big Mom Pirates and believes them to be a cruel and vicious crew. He particularly dislikes Big Mom and does not have a shred of respect for her, believing her to be a failure that cannot acknowledge her own shortcomings and instead tries to blame everyone else. He claimed Fish-Man Island as his territory from the Big Mom Pirates as he believed they were too dangerous to the inhabitants of the island. When he found out that Sanji had been forcibly taken by the Big Mom Pirates, he was furious and ventured into Totto Land just to get him back. He was frustrated by the Big Mom Pirates for how persistent they were in getting in his way, and grew to hate them more when he found out they were going to try and assassinate Sanji.

However, despite his general dislike towards the Big Mom Pirates, he is more than willing to make friends some of them. He made an ally out of Pekoms, who was the first member of the Big Mom Pirates he had met, and came to see him as a friend, having gotten extremely angry when he heard Capone Bege had shot him close to death. He started working with Bege, himself in order to assassinate Big Mom, and came to see him as a trusted ally. He also accepted Charlotte Pudding's help during his, and his crew's, escape from Whole Cake Island and trusted her enough to allow Sanji to join her to enact her plan. He came to have massive respect for Charlotte Katakuri after his fight and parted on much more positive terms with him than when they met.

===Charlotte Linlin===
[[File:Luffy Prepares To Fight Big Mom.png|thumb|left|250px|Luffy prepares to fight Big Mom in his Gear 4 form.]]

[[Charlotte Linlin]], otherwise known as Big Mom, is the [[Pirate Captain|captain]] of the [[Big Mom Pirates]], a former [[Four Emperors|Emperor]], the matriarch of the [[Charlotte Family]], and a former member of the [[Rocks Pirates]]. Big Mom and Luffy first encountered each other via a [[Den Den Mushi]] when he was on [[Fish-Man Island]] and later met in person when he had infiltrated her [[Totto Land|territory]] during the [[Whole Cake Island Arc]]. Big Mom loathes Luffy and finds him to be incredibly irritating. She initially brushed his threats aside but now despises him for his actions against her. Luffy hates Big Mom for trying to take [[Sanji]] away from him and believes her to be an extremely cruel and petty person.

At the end of the [[Fish-Man Island Arc]], Luffy came across members of the Big Mom Pirates and got into a dispute with them over their threat to the people of Fish-Man Island, eventually coming into contact with Big Mom herself via a Den Den Mushi. He states to Big Mom his intention to defeat her in the [[New World]] and claimed Fish-Man Island from her as his territory. Since then, Big Mom has pursued Luffy and his [[Straw Hat Pirates|crew]] and managed to separate them whilst they were in [[Dressrosa]]. She then arranged a wedding between her daughter, [[Charlotte Pudding]], and a child of the [[Vinsmoke Family]], and a member of the Straw Hats, [[Sanji]]. The Big Mom pirates kidnapped Sanji which resulted in Luffy traveling to Big Mom's territory to get him back. He fought, and lost, to Big Mom but succeeded in taking Sanji back. She has since followed Luffy to [[Wano Country|Wano]] with the intent of working with [[Kaidou]] to kill him. When Big Mom saw him again in [[Onigashima]], after Big Mom mocked Luffy and his allies attempt to bring down Kaidou, Luffy countered this statement, by pointing out this was an all-out war against all hostile forces in Wano, including Big Mom herself.{{Qref|chap=987|page=14}} 

Big Mom has immense hatred for Luffy. She originally brushed him off as another rookie who just talked big and promised that she would crush him in the New World. Despite having convincingly defeated him in a brief fight, she was left frustrated, and angry, by Luffy's actions. Not only did he sabotage her attempt to assassinate the Vinsmoke Family and take their [[Germa Kingdom|kingdom]], but he destroyed her [[Whole Cake Chateau|Chateau]], the wedding cake, smashed her only portrait of [[Carmel|Mother Caramel]], defeated two of her Sweet Commanders, took away [[Jinbe]] as an ally, and embarrassed her to the world at large after the [[newspaper]]s reported the events on Whole Cake Island. This has left her with an obsession to kill Luffy and is willing to travel all the way to Wano, into an opposing Emperor's territory, just to do so. She even tried to ally with her fellow Emperor, Kaidou. Big Mom was furthered enraged that her festivities with the Beast Pirates were ruined because of the raid on [[Onigashima]], to which she admitted she had gotten tired of Luffy ruining the festivities she was trying to enjoy.{{Qref|chap=988|page=11|ep=998}} Despite looking down on Luffy, some of her actions appear to show that she acknowledges his abilities, having sent one of her strongest crew members, [[Charlotte Cracker]], as well as [[Charlotte Brûlée]], to defeat him and his group. Later in the arc, after coming back to her senses, she planned to take Luffy's [[Soru Soru no Mi|soul]] as she acknowledged him to be powerful and thus could make strong homies out of him. When she was told that Cracker's victory looked certain she expressed a certain degree of disappointment.

She became furious when it was revealed Luffy had defeated Cracker and sent the Enraged Army after him in response.{{Qref|chap=845|page=4-5|ep=809|An enraged Big Mom sends a storm and her army to eliminate Luffy after he defeats Cracker.}} Once she had captured Luffy, she falsely stated she would be willing to spare his life, as per Sanji's request, when in reality she intends to kill him no matter what due to her hatred for him.{{Qref|chap=850|ep=817}} Her anger grew when Luffy gatecrashed the wedding and destroyed the cake she wanted to eat so badly. She was also shocked that Luffy had somehow managed to escape the prison she had him in. When Luffy revealed himself to her she was ready to fight him and was left annoyed when her son, [[Charlotte Katakuri]], intercepted Luffy, however she calmed down when he informed her of his true intentions. She was still eager to face Luffy and taunted him into a fight by calling him a coward. Having won their brief battle, she mocked his claim that he would come and defeat her after he has defeated Kaidou. During her hunger pangs, she became delirious and pursued Luffy and his crew to the edge of [[Whole Cake Island]] and tried to destroy his [[Thousand Sunny|ship]] whilst under the false impression that Luffy had another cake. When Luffy escaped her territory, she was completely furious and vented her anger by stabbing his [[Bounties#Identification|wanted poster]].{{Qref|chap=903}} Big Mom left her territory with some of her strong children to sail towards [[Wano Country]] to claim Luffy's head. During the [[Raid on Onigashima]], she still intend to kill Luffy but never had the chance when she was defeated and presumably dead by Luffy's rivals, [[Trafalgar D. Water Law]] and [[Eustass Kid]].

Luffy had initially believed that Big Mom was a nice person as she took over Fish-Man Island's protection duties after [[Edward Newgate|Whitebeard]] died. However, his opinion changed when he first encountered some of her crew members on Fish-Man Island and realized just how much of a danger she is. This compelled him to take the blame for the island's lack of candy and have Big Mom focus her anger onto him. He then claimed Fish-Man Island as his territory, stating he cannot allow someone who would destroy the island on a whim to continue protecting it. His anger with Big Mom grew when she forced his crew to separate after arriving in Dressrosa and blackmailed Sanji to leave his crew in order to have him married into her family. Luffy thus decided to infiltrate her territory to recover Sanji and became even more incensed when Charlotte Pudding revealed Big Mom's plan to kill Sanji. He dislikes Big Mom to such a degree that he was willing to work with [[Capone Bege]], someone he also disliked, in order to defeat her.{{Qref|chap=858|chap2=859|ep=}}

Despite his hatred for Big Mom, he did not infiltrate her territory with the intention of trying to defeat her, instead he wished to just save Sanji. He has also shown signs of pity towards her and believes her to be a failure, finding her complaints over others to be pathetic. He has ridiculed her on more than one occasion and has openly defied her despite her status as an Emperor. He is not at all fazed by her strength and unabashedly states he will defeat her, along with every other Emperor, in the New World. He also declared to her that he would be the one to become the [[Pirate#Pirate King|Pirate King]], not her.{{Qref|chap=847|ep=813}}

===Charlotte Pudding===
[[File:Pudding Informs Luffy Of Her True Intentions.png|thumb|250px|Pudding informs Luffy of her intentions to kill Sanji.]]

[[Charlotte Pudding]] is an officer of the [[Big Mom Pirates]] and the 35th daughter of [[Charlotte Linlin|Big Mom]]. She met Luffy during the [[Whole Cake Island Arc]] and was initially his enemy but later became an ally to him. They share a chaotic relationship due to Pudding's split personality disorder and deceptiveness. Pudding disliked Luffy and saw him as her enemy because of her loyalty to Big Mom, but later, due to her feelings for [[Sanji]], decided to aid him in his and Sanji's escape. Luffy disliked Pudding due to her sinister side and her attempt to kill Sanji, however, even though he was confused by her desire to aid him, he came to accept her as an ally.

They first met when Luffy arrived on [[Cacao Island]] and was about to be arrested after he ate her cafe but was saved thanks to Pudding's intervention. She then invited him and his group inside her home and was "shocked" to find out they were here to rescue [[Sanji]], whilst Luffy was also shocked to find out she is Sanji's betrothed. Pudding feigned her desire to help Luffy and showed him a map to [[Whole Cake Island]] and promised to bring him Sanji the next day before sending him and his group towards the Seducing Woods. After [[Nami]] and Luffy were captured, Pudding turned up at their cell and revealed her true nature to the pair whilst taunting them. Following Luffy's sabotage of the wedding, and being won over by Sanji, Pudding decided to work with Sanji to produce a new wedding cake for Big Mom to eat so she would stop pursuing Luffy and his crew. She then said her goodbyes to Sanji with a kiss as he returned to Luffy and escaped [[Totto Land]].

Pudding does not seem to hate Luffy in particular, in fact, it seems her animosity towards the Straw Hats all together is a result of her belief that she must obey Big Mom. Because of this, she intentionally misled Luffy and his crew throughout the early parts of the arc. She pretended to not know who Luffy and his group were during their first encounter and pretended to offer aid in his mission to retrieve Sanji, but instead lured them into the Seducing Woods so they could be captured. After he and Nami had been captured, she gleefully revealed her true nature to both of them and reveled her intention to kill his crew mate, Sanji.{{Qref|name=Vinsmoke|chap=850|page=15-16|ep=817}} She showed no remorse or regret over her deception and genuinely seemed to revel in deceiving Luffy and his group.

However, she had a change of heart once she developed a genuine love for Sanji and thus desired to help him escape with Luffy and his crew. She came up with the plan to bake a cake with Sanji for Big Mom to eat in order to stop her going after Luffy and the Straw Hats. Before leaving with Sanji to enact this plan, she chose to help Luffy and his group by confusing all the [[homies]] of the Seducing Woods to create a direct path so that he could reach the [[Thousand Sunny]].{{Qref|chap=876|page=6-14|ep=847|ep2=848}} She was worried for Luffy and his crew when she saw her brothers aboard his ship. Whilst baking the cake, she discovered that Luffy was in a one-on-one fight with her older brother, and Sweet Commander, [[Charlotte Katakuri]], and was worried for his well-being because of the sheer strength of Katakuri, but was reassured by Sanji that Luffy will win.{{Qref|chap=884|page=15|ep=}}

Luffy implicitly trusted her when they first met and was shocked to find out she was Sanji's bride. He believed her when she expressed her desire to help them retrieve Sanji and followed her directions that took his group into the Seducing Woods that led to him having to fight the Sweet Commander, [[Charlotte Cracker]]. He was very angry when she arrived outside of his jail cell and revealed her true nature, and became even more angry when she expressed her intentions to kill Sanji. When he met her again, whilst escaping from Big Mom, he was very hostile towards her and held a grudge for what she did, but was confused by her flip-flopping personality between wanting to help him and wanting him to die. However, he trusted her enough to allow Sanji to join her to enact her plan to lure Big Mom away from him and his crew.

===Charlotte Brûlée===
[[File:Luffy and Brûlée.png|thumb|left|250px|Luffy and Brûlée after he uses her to escape the Mirro-World.]]

[[Charlotte Brûlée]] is an officer of the [[Big Mom Pirates]], the eighth daughter of [[Charlotte Linlin|Big Mom]], and an antagonist, as well as a forced ally, to Luffy and the [[Straw Hat Pirates|Straw Hats]]. Although the two are nothing but enemies, their relationship is comedic. Brûlée despises Luffy just like the rest of the Big Mom Pirates and is irritated with all the things he makes her do whilst she is his captive. Luffy finds Brûlée annoying and does not like her for trying to harm his friends, however, he comes to tolerate her presence and acts jovial with her.

They met inside the Seducing Woods after [[Charlotte Pudding]] sent Luffy and his team in that direction. She captured members of his crew and used her [[Mira Mira no Mi|Devil Fruit]] abilities to trick them all. She was eventually defeated and captured by [[Carrot]] and was forced to aid Luffy and his team's efforts to sabotage [[Sanji]] and Pudding's wedding. She later managed to escape and was with [[Charlotte Katakuri]] and Luffy inside the [[Mirro-World]] where she attempted to burn down the [[Thousand Sunny]] with Luffy's crew on board. She then proved useful for Luffy as she allowed him to escape the Mirro-World to get some vital respite from his fight with Katakuri. He returned with her to the Mirro-World to continue his battle. By the end of his fight she had escaped her binds but was captured by [[Pekoms]], who then used her to carry Luffy out of the Mirro-World. It was Brûlée who then informed the rest of her family about Luffy's victory over Katakuri.

Brûlée has nothing but hatred for Luffy due to her loyalty to Big Mom and her [[Charlotte Family|family]]. She was infuriated with Luffy's actions regarding the sabotage of the wedding and was distressed when being used by him and his crew to help him achieve his goals. She was distraught and filled with rage when she discovered Luffy had defeated Katakuri and told her siblings not to allow him to live. Brûlée also finds Luffy irritating, as he constantly mispronounces her name and carried her around on his back when hopping in and out of the Mirro-World whilst also putting her life at risk. She was terrified when he carried her through [[Nuts Island]] whilst being pursued by a delirious Big Mom. She desperately called for her sibling's help, but Luffy managed to escape them all. She looks down on Luffy and constantly belittled him when he was facing Katakuri, bragging to him about the immense power her older brother possesses. Throughout her captivity with Luffy and his crew she would state to them that Big Mom would kill them all. Following his victory over Katakuri, she tells her older brother that she will never forgive Luffy for what he did to him.

Luffy was greatly irritated by Brûlée, finding her to be a pest whilst in the Seducing Woods and was extremely annoyed by her antagonizing comments to him when she was bragging about Katakuri and attempted to strike her. However, he is dominantly calm in her company and does not take her seriously as an enemy when he held her captive. It was also Luffy's idea to use her powers to help sabotage Sanji's wedding. He was happy when she arrived on his ship through a mirror as it allowed him to drag Katakuri to the Mirro-World and off the Thousand Sunny. He became extremely grateful when he was frantically trying to escape the Mirro-World after using [[Gomu Gomu no Mi/Gear 4 Techniques|Gear 4]] and found Brûlée sat idly by and used her to escape Katakuri. He was briefly worried when, after his victory over Katakuri, she escaped her binds but was relieved to see she had been caught by Pekoms. He has the habit of mispronouncing her name, instead of “Brûlée”, he calls her “Branch”.

===Charlotte Cracker===
[[File:Luffy vs Cracker.png|thumb|250px|Luffy prepares to fight Cracker and his legion of Biscuit Soldiers.]]

[[Charlotte Cracker]] is a Sweet Commander of the [[Big Mom Pirates]] and is the tenth son of [[Charlotte Linlin|Big Mom]]. Cracker and Luffy met during the [[Whole Cake Island Arc]] as enemies and fought each other with Luffy emerging the victor. Cracker looked down on Luffy and belittled him throughout their fight, both for his rescue effort of [[Sanji]] and his career as a [[pirate]]. Luffy found Cracker to be greatly irritating because of his [[Bisu Bisu no Mi|Devil Fruit]] power and strongly disliked him for his insults of his [[Straw Hat Pirates|crew]], especially the comments about Sanji.

Whilst on [[Whole Cake Island]], Luffy was sent to the Seducing Woods by [[Charlotte Pudding]] and was eventually attacked by Cracker who was ordered by Big Mom to kill Luffy. The two fought each other in a long fight that spanned eleven hours, with their battle becoming a war of attrition. Eventually, with Nami's aid, Luffy won out and was able to defeat Cracker with his improvised [[Gomu Gomu no Mi/Gear 4 Techniques#Tankman|Gear 4 Tankman]], sending him flying back towards [[Sweet City]].{{Qref|chap=842|chap2=843|page=11-15,2-6|ep=}}

Similar to most of the Big Mom Pirates, Cracker loathed Luffy out of the sake of following Big Mom's orders. Throughout his battle with the Straw Hat captain, he constantly ridiculed and patronized him, believing him to be a completely inferior pirate to anyone in the Big Mom Pirates. He chose to make false assumptions about Sanji's opinions of Luffy and his crew as a way to antagonize Luffy.{{Qref|chap=837|page=15-17|ep=799}} Nonetheless, he found the Straw Hat captain to be an exhausting opponent due to his insatiable hunger and being able to eat all his biscuit soldiers. He offered a little bit of praise for having broken his biscuit armor and forced him to show his true self to Luffy. He panicked when he tried to stab Luffy in his Gear 4 Tankman form and soon realized he could not do any damage. Cracker was then quickly swallowed up and sent crashing into Sweet City, defeated.

Luffy found Charlotte Cracker to be irritating because of the insane amount of biscuit soldiers he could produce with his Devil Fruit powers, and was only able to deal with them via eating thanks to [[Nami]]'s help. He became enraged at his comments about Sanji and took offence to them, becoming much more aggressive to the Sweet Commander. He managed to defeat Cracker with Gear 4 Tankman, violently sending him back to Sweet City, however, this victory eventually led to Luffy's capture by the Big Mom's army.{{Qref|chap=846|page=7|ep=}}

===Charlotte Katakuri===
[[File:Katakuri and Luffy.png|thumb|left|Luffy fighting Katakuri.]]

[[Charlotte Katakuri]] is a Sweet Commander of the [[Big Mom Pirates]], the second son of [[Charlotte Linlin|Big Mom]] and is a major antagonist to Luffy during the [[Whole Cake Island Arc]]. The two shared a sense of hostility and thoroughly saw each other as enemies, however, by the end of their fight they had grown to immensely respect each other. Originally, Katakuri looked down on Luffy as inferior but now sees him as an equal and acknowledges his claim to become the [[Pirate#Pirate King|Pirate King]]. To Luffy, Katakuri was an incredibly frustrating, and overwhelmingly tough, enemy. However, he also developed great respect for him and sees him as someone he must surpass.

The two met during the sabotage of [[Sanji]] and [[Charlotte Pudding|Pudding]]'s wedding. Luffy, with the goal of destroying [[Carmel|Mother Caramel]]'s portrait, was intercepted by Katakuri and got stuck to his leg that was made of [[Mochi Mochi no Mi|mochi]]. He later encountered Katakuri on the [[Thousand Sunny]] and tried to get him off so his [[Straw Hat Pirates|crew]] could set sail and succeeded by dragging him to the [[Mirro-World]]. They spent the next twelve hours fighting each other in a grueling battle that ended with Luffy's victory.

They both had a monumental impact on each other. Katakuri was by far Luffy's toughest opponent since he arrived in the [[New World]], having been completely outmatched against the top Sweet Commander. This difference in strength compelled Luffy to keep fighting him as he desired to reach his level. Luffy was the first person Katakuri had met that broke his prestige as the perfect being, having never lost a fight or lied down on his back, and ultimately ended his burden of maintaining such a reputation. He was confused, but amazed, by Luffy's refusal to stay down no matter how hard he beat him to the ground.

Katakuri thought little of Luffy and saw him as nothing more than a nuisance. Throughout their fight, he patronized the Straw Hat captain and would mimic his techniques with greater superiority, either doing them bigger or more efficiently. He thought so little of Luffy that he refused to believe his claim that he had figured out how he utilizes his [[Haki/Kenbunshoku Haki|Kenbunshoku Haki]] with his [[Devil Fruit]] powers, even though he was being pushed back by Luffy's [[Gomu Gomu no Mi/Gear 4 Techniques|Gear 4]] form. He grew frustrated by Luffy's stubbornness and openly admitted to him that he was feeling stressed because of how long it was taking to defeat him. His dislike for Luffy grew when he went to try and attack his sister, [[Charlotte Brûlée]], and threw him into a wall. Eventually, his frustration peaked, and he reluctantly used his awakened Devil Fruit powers to suffocate Luffy to death, but apologized to the Straw Hat captain for having to end the fight this way. Whilst enjoying his snack break he became enraged once he realized Luffy had exposed his pelican eel-like mouth and sloppy eating manners. He killed the nearby chefs for seeing him this way and continued his fight with Luffy whilst being filled with anger, however, this rage allowed Luffy to finally land a hit on him and momentarily overwhelm him.

Despite his attitude towards Luffy, he recognizes his potential and understands the threat he poses to his mother and [[Charlotte Family|family]] further down the line.{{Qref|chap=873|page=5|ep=}} He was thus adamant to his siblings that he needed to dispose of Luffy now before he becomes a future threat. He expressed admiration for Luffy's determination to protect his crew and to fight him head on, recognizing his will power and bravery. He complimented the Straw Hat captain for constraining him, instead of trying to fight him, whilst he was on the Thousand Sunny, as his crew could set sail this way. He was surprised when, after he had escaped the Mirro-World, Luffy choose to return and continue fighting him, acknowledging his bravery. Having initially been in-denial, he was ultimately impressed when Luffy proved he had figured out how he utilizes his Devil Fruit abilities with his heavily advanced Kenbunshoku Haki, complimenting the Straw Hat captain and admitting he now understands how his younger brother, and fellow Sweet Commander, [[Charlotte Cracker]], lost to him. Once he noticed that Luffy was on course to attaining the same advanced Kenbunshoku Haki as him, he expressed his shock and became determined to defeat Luffy before he becomes too dangerous.

[[File:Luffy And Katakuri At The End of Their Battle.png|thumb|250px|Luffy and Katakuri at the climax of their battle.]]

However, despite his concern for Luffy's progress, he became extremely angry on his behalf when he realized his younger sister, [[Charlotte Flampe]], had interfered in their fight and was the reason why he was able to impale Luffy. He ridiculed his younger sister and decided to impale himself so he could fight Luffy evenly. It was also here that he removed his scarf and fully exposed his mouth to everyone present. He apologized to Luffy for not noticing what she had done and unleashed his [[Haki/Haoshoku Haki|Haoshoku Haki]], along with Luffy's, to knock out Flampe and her followers. It was here that Katakuri fully stated to Luffy that he no longer thinks he is below his level.{{Qref|chap=893}} From then on, Katakuri began to fight Luffy, not out of obligation to Big Mom as a member of her crew, but out of respect for the Straw Hat captain. He expressed his desire for Luffy to continue fighting him and was eager when he foresaw some of Luffy's unique attacks, telling him to bring it on with a smile. He was surprised by Luffy's [[Gomu Gomu no Mi/Gear 4 Techniques#Snakeman|Snakeman form]] and found the speed of his attacks impressive, pushing him to his limits. At the climax of their fight, he asked Luffy if he would come back one day to defeat Big Mom and after hearing his resounding response he smiled and acknowledge his claim to become the Pirate King before falling on his back, defeated, for the first time in his life. When he woke up, as Brûlée tended to his wounds, he asked about Luffy and was pleased to find out he had escaped and recognized Luffy as a competent fighter.{{Qref|chap=902}}

For Luffy, Katakuri was the first real taste of the power of an elite member of an Emperor's crew. He found him to be an absurdly tough, and difficult, enemy. For most of the fight, he was completely outmatched and had to rely on his will power, speed and stamina just to survive his onslaught. This soon led him to recognize just how powerful Katakuri is which fueled his desire to surpass him. Despite how much of a hindrance he was, Luffy never showed any real hatred towards Katakuri and gave him the utmost respect throughout their battle, although he was still enraged when he saw Katakuri subduing [[Carrot]]. Unlike most of his opponents, Luffy never called Katakuri by anything but his actual name, instead of a nickname or shortening it, which symbolizes his respect for him. He was not at all fazed by his appearance when he saw his mouth for the first time, not even acknowledging it, instead just wanting to continue their fight. After he managed to escape the Mirro-World he resolved to go back and face Katakuri, telling himself that he wants to surpass him as he understood that Katakuri was on a whole different level to him. Throughout their fight, Luffy tried to learn from Katakuri and replicate his future sight ability with gradual success. While Katakuri apologies to him for Flampe's interference, Luffy declared to the Sweet Commander that in a duel between pirates, there is no such thing as playing fair and unable to dodge his Mogura was his greatest mistake. He was happy to hear Katakuri tell him that he no longer believed he was below his level. When Katakuri kindly asked him if he would come back to defeat Big Mom one day, he proudly told him that he will because he will become the Pirate King and was left surprised by his words of encouragement as he fell onto his back for the first time in his life. He placed his fedora over Katakuri's mouth to cover it, knowing how much he does not like others seeing it, as a sign of respect.{{Qref|chap=896}}

===Pekoms===
[[File:Luffy Gets Angry With Pekoms.png|thumb|left|250px|Luffy angry with Pekoms when he informs him about Sanji joining the Big Mom Pirates following his wedding.]]

[[Pekoms]] is a member of the [[Big Mom Pirates]] and a former member of the [[Nox Pirates]]. Originally, the two were enemies but eventually became allies and friends following the events of the [[Zou Arc|Zou]] and [[Whole Cake Island Arc]]s. Pekoms found Luffy to be a rude and frustrating person but soon came to see him as an ally he wished to help for the sake of honoring his [[Pedro|brother]]'s sacrifice. Luffy did not necessarily think much of Pekoms when he first met him, but viewed him as a friend when he met him again on [[Zou]] and had gotten to know him better.

The two first met on [[Fish-Man Island]] after he, and his partner, [[Tamago]], were trying to take the monthly candy from the island for [[Charlotte Linlin|Big Mom]]. He got into a dispute with the Straw Hat captain and was shocked when Luffy antagonized Big Mom through a [[Den Den Mushi]]. During the [[Dressrosa Arc]], he was part of the team that chased half of the Straw Hats away from the kingdom and towards Zou. Once he arrived on Zou, he discovered that the Straw Hats had saved his fellow Minks and was greatly indebted to them, but was betrayed by [[Capone Bege]] because he was willing to forgo his mission to repay his debt to them. It was here he reunited with Luffy and explained the situation to him. He was forcibly taken as part of the Sanji Retrieval Team where he aided Luffy and the Straw Hats, especially during their escape.

Pekoms is often stunned by Luffy's chaotic and forthright determination. When he first met him, he was stunned to see Luffy would openly threaten an [[Four Emperors|Emperor]] of the sea and found him to be a frustrating person to deal with, ultimately leaving Fish-Man Island viewing him as an enemy. He was left even more stunned when Luffy declared his intention to go to Big Mom's [[Totto Land|territory]] to retrieve [[Sanji]]. Following the events on Zou he felt deep gratitude for what Luffy's crew did for the [[Mink Tribe]] but still saw him as an enemy. He was reluctant to aid Luffy in his mission to retrieve Sanji and was forcibly taken by the Straw Hat captain. His reluctancy changed when he discovered that his brother, Pedro, had sacrificed his own life to aid Luffy and his crew. This led to him becoming a vital aid in Luffy's escape following his fight with [[Charlotte Katakuri]], carrying the Straw Hat captain out of the [[Mirro-World]] after having first captured [[Charlotte Brûlée]], and proceeded to activate his Sulong form to fight off the Big Mom Pirates who were waiting for Luffy to escape.{{Qref|chap=896}}

Luffy mostly saw Pekoms as a friend after they had met again on Zou. He showed concern for his well-being when [[Jack]], of the [[Beasts Pirates]], attacked Zou for a second time and was thankful for his aid when traveling to Big Mom's territory, having forcibly tied him to the back of his backpack in order for him to come with them. He was absolutely furious when he found out Capone Bege had shot him, thinking he had died, and was prepared to attack his fellow [[Super Rookie]] for doing this.{{Qref|chap=857}} He was relieved to be saved by Pekoms and was happy to see he was alive, easily seeing through his disguise.

==Beasts Pirates==
[[File:Luffy Captured By The Beast Pirates.png|thumb|250px|Luffy captured and taunted by the Beasts Pirates.]]

The [[Beasts Pirates]] are an extremely notorious and powerful crew led by the former [[Four Emperors|Emperor]], [[Kaidou]]. They faithfully follow their Governer-General and thus despise Luffy and the [[Straw Hat Pirates|Straw Hats]] like he does. Once he was in [[Wano Country|Wano]], members of the Beasts Pirates tried to frustrate Luffy's efforts there and got into numerous clashes with the Straw Hat captain, with Luffy repeatedly emerging the victor until he fought Kaidou. Luffy dominantly dislikes their captain, Kaidou, but also views the rest of the Beasts Pirates as his enemies.

Luffy made himself an enemy of the Beasts Pirates for destroying their supply of [[SMILE]]s and defeating [[Donquixote Doflamingo|Doflamingo]], a business partner of theirs. He had not encountered a single member of the Beasts Pirates up until he entered Wano, Kaidou's territory. Upon arrival he got into multiple fights with members of the Beasts Pirates, such as some kidnappers that were after [[Kurozumi Tama|Tama]], his fellow [[Super Rookie|Supernova]], and newest Shinuchi of the Beasts Pirates, [[Basil Hawkins]], another Shinuchi, [[Holed'em]], and eventually their captain, Kaidou. He lost his fight to Kaidou and was quickly thrown into Udon Prison by the Beasts Pirates. However, Luffy has maintained his animosity towards the crew, having defeated a third Shinuchi, and Vice-Warden of Udon Prison, [[Dobon]] and fought two more, [[Daifugo]] and [[Babanuki]]. After meeting [[Queen]], he has continued to defeat more members of the Beasts Pirates, including members of the Numbers and Gifters. Eventually, he was able to defeat Babanuki and end the Beasts Pirates' control over Udon Prison. During the attack on the day of the [[Fire Festival]], he clashed with the Tobiroppo, [[Ulti]] and [[Page One]].

The Beasts Pirates do not seem to particularly hate Luffy for any reason other than for angering their captain by destroying their supply of SMILEs. Every member of the Beasts Pirates have been hostile and antagonistic to Luffy but are often left amazed by how powerful he is. Members of the Beasts Pirates were shocked that Luffy was so willing to attack their captain, Kaidou, despite his power, but soon mocked him for his defeat after they had him in chains. However, whilst he was in their prison, they soon realized that they cannot possibly contain Luffy as he was still incredibly strong despite having [[Seastone]] cuffs attached to him. One of the All-Stars, [[Queen]], seems to have a lot of respect for Luffy and desires for him to join the Beasts Pirates, even offering to convince Kaidou to pardon Luffy if he agrees to do so. Furthermore, Ulti and Page One acknowledged Luffy's strength when they encountered him.

Initially, Luffy had no personal grudge against the crew or even their captain, as he simply wished to defeat them as part of his alliance with [[Trafalgar D. Water Law|Trafalgar Law]]. However, he now greatly despises the Beasts Pirates after discovering their atrocities, not just against the [[Kouzuki Family]], but against the [[Mink Tribe]] by one of the All-Stars, [[Jack]]. He was also infuriated by the way the Beasts Pirates, and Kaidou, have treated Wano, allowing people to starve and for polluting the natural resources of the land, and has vowed to Tama to remove The Beasts Pirates from Wano. He was incredibly angry with one of the Shinuchi of the Beasts Pirates, Holed'em, after he discovered what he had done to Tama's cheek when he held her captive. He proceeded to defeat Holed'em with a powerful Red-Hawk punch. He was furious with another member of the Beasts Pirates, Dobon, for harming his fellow inmate, [[Hyougoro]] and once more became angry when Daifugo also harmed him. Whilst he was in Udon Prison, Luffy showed a complete disregard for the authority of the Beasts Pirates there. However, he is willing to make friends with members of the Beasts Pirates, such as [[Speed]], who was tamed by Tama, and trusted her to carry Tama back to her home safely.

===Kaidou===
[[File:Luffy Lies Defeated Before Kaidou.png|thumb|left|250px|Luffy lies defeated after his fight with Kaidou in Kuri.]]

[[Kaidou]] is the [[Admiral (Fleet Captain)|Governor-General]] of the [[Beasts Pirates]], a former [[Four Emperors|Emperor]], and a former [[Pirate Apprentice|apprentice]] of the [[Rocks Pirates]]. The two knew of each other well before they met, with Kaidou discovering that Luffy was behind the destruction of [[SMILE]]s and the defeat of [[Donquixote Doflamingo|Doflamingo]], whilst Luffy heard of Kaidou through his alliance with [[Trafalgar D. Water Law|Trafalgar Law]]. They both have a great disdain for each other. Kaidou initially found Luffy to be a weak and irritating [[pirate]] who kept disrupting his business. Luffy completely hates Kaidou for the atrocities he has committed against his friends and [[Straw Hat Pirates|crew]], as well as to the people of [[Wano Country|Wano]]. As their fierce battle progessed during the Raid of Onigashima, Kaidou and Luffy had begun to enjoy their fight with each other and seemingly developed some kind of respect. Ultimately, their battle concluded with Luffy's victory and Kaidou's fate is unknown.

On [[Punk Hazard]], Luffy reunited with Trafalgar Law and joined him in an alliance with the express goal of taking down Kaidou. From then on, he began disrupting Kaidou's businesses since entering the [[New World]], from Punk Hazard, where he captured [[Caesar Clown]] and destroyed his production of SMILEs, to [[Dressrosa]] where he defeated Kaidou's business partner, Doflamingo. Luffy then travelled to [[Zou]] where he strengthened his [[Ninja-Pirate-Mink-Samurai Alliance|alliance]] against Kaidou and, after a brief stop in [[Totto Land]], arrived in Wano and began his assault on Kaidou's territory before clashing with Kaidou himself where he suffered a crushing defeat. On the day of the [[Fire Festival]] Luffy arrived on [[Onigashima]] and begun an attack on Kaidou with his allies to remove him from Wano, eventually succeeding. It was also here that Luffy befriended and allied with Kaidou's son, [[Yamato]].

Kaidou had heard of Luffy as a member of the [[Worst Generation]] well before his transgressions against him. He did not think much of Luffy but quickly grew to hate the Straw Hat captain for his actions against him. When Luffy had destroyed his source of SMILEs, he wept and cursed his name. He became even more angry after Luffy defeated his business partner, Doflamingo. He sometimes vents his anger by having his subordinates hold up Luffy's [[Bounties#Identification|wanted poster]] and punches them. Such is his hatred, he was annoyed to discover that Luffy had gone to [[Charlotte Linlin|Big Mom]]'s territory instead of his, and bluntly refused Big Mom's request to kill Luffy as he wished to do so himself.

Early on he had a very low opinion of Luffy and believed himself to be far stronger than he could ever be. After defeating Luffy in their brief fight, he derided the Straw Hat captain for how weak he was and mocked his claim to be the [[Pirate#Pirate King|Pirate King]].{{Qref|chap=923}} However, when Luffy used [[Haki/Haoshoku Haki|Haoshoku Haki]] whilst unconscious he was both impressed and extremely annoyed. Nonetheless, he clearly has some level of acknowledgement for Luffy's abilities, as instead of killing the Straw Hat captain he decided to capture him and “break his spirit” with the intent of making him fight for his crew.{{Qref|chap=924}} He has since demanded that [[Queen]] convince Luffy to join the Beasts Pirates and is willing to wait until he agrees. When he battled Luffy atop the Skull Dome, Kaidou acknowledged Luffy to be a capable fighter, at one point recognizing his ambition to stand on equal footing to that of [[Shanks]], [[Edward Newgate|Whitebeard]], [[Kouzuki Oden]], [[Rocks D. Xebec]], and [[Gol D. Roger]].{{Qref|chap=1001}} He was impressed with Luffy's determination to fight him, commenting to him, "Not bad Straw Hat! Your eyes never seem to lose their fire!"{{Qref|chap=1008}} and even seemed disappointed when it appeared Luffy was not actually [[Joy Boy]].{{Qref|chap=1014}} When he defeated Luffy a third time, he was furious that this was achieved through the intervention of [[CP0]] and killed the agent for this.{{Qref|chap=1043}} When Luffy returned in his [[Gomu Gomu no Mi/Gear 5 Techniques|Gear 5]] form, despite the silly nature Luffy arrived in, Kaidou was visibly pleased he had survived and apologized to the Straw Hat captain for allowing CP0 to interfere with their battle.{{Qref|chap=1044}} During Kaidou's apparent final moments as he descended into the magma pit below Wano, he recalled telling [[King]] that Joy Boy would be the one to defeat him, seemingly acknowledging that Luffy is Joy Boy.{{Qref|chap=1049}}

Luffy hated Kaidou and believed him to be a cruel person. When he allied with Trafalgar Law to take down the Emperor he had no actual opinion of him, but that changed once he landed on Zou and discovered not only what his subordinate, and a member of the All-Stars, [[Jack]], had done to the [[Mink Tribe]], but also learned what Kaidou had done to the [[Kouzuki Family]]. When he arrived in Wano, he discovered just how badly the people are mistreated there because of Kaidou's rule and became even more determined to defeat him. Luffy's anger with Kaidou exploded when he watched him destroy [[Kouzuki Oden|Oden]]'s Castle whilst his [[Straw Hat Pirates|crew]] were hiding there. Under the impression he had killed his friends, he attacked the Emperor in a fit of rage. When he discovered that he had assaulted, and possibly killed, [[Kurozumi Tama|Tama]], he chose to continue fighting Kaidou, instead of retreating, in order to avenge her. Such is his hatred for Kaidou that, after he had defeated him, the Emperor noted that Luffy was still glaring at him with anger despite being unconscious. Luffy has turned down numerous offers from Queen to join Kaidou's crew and continuously ridicules the Emperor and openly professes his intent to defeat him. Luffy would ultimately succeed in defeating Kaidou, delivering a powerful final blow whilst declaring to the Emperor that he wishes to create a world where his friends can eat as much as they want.{{Qref|chap=1049}}

Despite the overwhelming power difference, Luffy was not the least bit deterred. When Law informed him that their alliance had only a 30% chance of succeeding, he was not at all fazed and remained enthusiastic to face him. He proudly declared to Big Mom that he would defeat Kaidou and was not scared in his brief fight against him. Following his defeat, his spirit has nod not been dampened and still thoroughly believed that he will defeat the Emperor. His determination to defeat Kaidou compelled Luffy to train his abilities further, such as using the forced prison labor as an opportunity to train in order to become stronger. After liberating Udon Prison, Luffy devoted the remainder of his time before the [[Fire Festival]] to train nonstop, under [[Hyougoro]]'s supervision, in order to develop his [[Haki/Busoshoku Haki|Busoshoku Haki]] to an advanced enough level to take down Kaidou as Oden had nearly done in the past. Before their rematch on top of the Skull Dome, Luffy angrily recalled all the atrocities that he witnessed and befell on Wano Country, the Mink Tribe, and the Kouzuki Family as a result of Kaidou's tyranny. He vented his pent-up fury with his improved Busoshoku Haki attack on Kaidou, causing him significant damage as Luffy declared that he would surpass him and become Pirate King. Despite all of the bad things Kaidou did to him and others, Luffy acknowledged Kaidou´s warrior honor and accepted his apology when their duel was interrupted by CP0 which allowed Kaidou to strike him unprepared.

===Queen===
[[Queen]] is one of the All-Stars of the [[Beasts Pirates]], is in charge of Udon Prison where Luffy was held and is one of the antagonists of the [[Wano Country Arc]]. Despite viewing him as weak, he has come to respect Luffy whilst still remaining antagonistic towards him. Luffy, himself, views Queen as his enemy but does not hold any notable contempt for him, nor is intimidated by his power as a member of the All-Stars, as he openly challenged him for a fight.

Following his defeat at the hands of [[Kaidou]], Luffy was taken to Udon Prison where he eventually recovered and began to cause mayhem. During his attempted escape, Queen arrived on the scene and commanded his subordinates to stop Luffy. He then forced Luffy, along with [[Hyougoro]], to participate in a theatre fight called the [[Sumo Inferno]]. The following day, the [[Four Emperors|emperor]], [[Charlotte Linlin|Big Mom]], broke into Udon Prison, suffering from amnesia, and was captured by Queen but this allowed Luffy to escape him.

Although he is his enemy, Queen is greatly amused by Luffy and is seen enjoying the show he put on during his Sumo Inferno. At one point, he openly disagreed with his own men that Luffy and Hyougoro would die, as he sees Luffy as a genuinely capable fighter. When the Straw Hat captain used his [[Haki/Haoshoku Haki|Haoshoku Haki]] he is visibly impressed. He is also a fair person, as he decided to remove Luffy's [[seastone]] handcuffs so he could fight at his best in his Sumo Inferno. Kaidou had tasked Queen with the job of having Luffy join his crew and thus would occasionally offer the chance to the Straw Hat captain despite his rebellious nature. Nonetheless, he still put a collar on Luffy that would kill him if he left his Sumo Inferno ring, showing that he was more than ready to have him killed. He also laughed at Luffy's request to fight him and even enabled Luffy to escape as he valued capturing the Big Mom over the security of his prison. Queen also seemed to get offended when Luffy would refer to him as "Balloon" and when he attempted to punch him.

Luffy does not like Queen but nor does he hold any particular contempt for him. He was more than happy to participate in his Sumo Inferno game and used it as an opportunity to further strengthen his [[Haki/Busoshoku Haki|Busoshoku Haki]]. He is also not the least bit intimidated by Queen, as he refers to him as "Balloon" and demanded a fight from him. At one point he openly attacks him, but Queen effortlessly deflects his punch. Furthermore, Luffy openly disrespects Kaidou to him and refuses all his offers to join the Beasts Pirates. When Queen tried to ridicule and threaten him, he simply told him to shut up and that he would be the one to decide when and where he dies. On the night after his first day in the Sumo Inferno game he also ate all of Queen's oshiruko.

===Ulti===
[[File:Ulti and Luffy Clash.png|thumb|250px|Luffy and Ulti clash.]]
[[Ulti]] is a member of the [[Beast Pirates]], one of the Tobiroppo and an antagonist of the [[Wano Country Arc]]. They briefly met when Luffy stormed [[Onigashima]] and fought for a short amount of time. Both Luffy and Ulti acknowledged each other's strength before they were interrupted by [[Yamato]].

The two stumbled on each other by chance after Ulti and [[Page One]] slid down a set of stairs and landed at Luffy's feet. The two immediately began fighting and although she did not know who he was she quickly acknowledged him. When subordinates of the Beast Pirates questioned Ulti's decision to transform she simply admitted to them that Luffy is formidable.

She is very protective of Page One and thus was furious when Luffy attacked him. She prepared to retaliate but their fight was interrupted by [[Yamato]], 'son' of Kaidou. Her care for Page One is such that, after hurting him when they fell down the stairs, she immediately berated Luffy as she believed he was responsible. Furthermore, her loyalty to [[Kaidou]] caused her to become angry by Luffy's open declaration that he will be the [[Pirate#Pirate King|Pirate King]]. This anger by Luffy's claim prompted her to later brutally attack both of Luffy's crew mates, Nami and Usopp, and tried to force Nami to claim her captain would never become Pirate King. However, she became angrier when Nami instead stated Luffy would become king.{{Qref|chap=995|page=15-17}}

===Holed'em===
[[File:Luffy Punches Holed'em.png|thumb|left|250px|Luffy defeats Holed'em with a Red-Hawk punch.]]

[[Holed'em]] is a Shinuchi of the [[Beasts Pirates]] and is a minor antagonist to Luffy during the [[Wano Country Arc]]. The two crossed paths after Holed'em kidnapped [[Kurozumi Tama|Tama]], who Luffy had befriended, and eventually clashed with Luffy comfortably winning. Holed'em viewed Luffy as an enemy for causing trouble in [[Kuri|Bakura Town]], although he was not aware of who he actually was because of the isolation of Wano. Luffy despised Holed'em for kidnapping and harming Tama.

After Tama had been kidnapped by [[Batman]] and [[Gazelleman]] she was taken to Holed'em because of her unique Devil Fruit abilities to tame animals. Luffy, having witnessed the kidnapping of his friend, stormed Bakura Town looking for her. Luffy defeated [[Urashima]] and sent the sumo wrestler flying into Holed'em's home, crushing him. He got up and immediately confronted the Straw Hat captain whilst threatening Tama with the lion on his stomach. The two soon fought and he was soundly defeated by Luffy.

Holed'em was not aware of who Luffy was and so had no predisposition towards him. Nonetheless, due to his narcissism, he was very angry with the chaos he was causing in his town and accused him of being in cahoots with [[Ashura Doji|Shutenmaru]]. He intentionally antagonized Luffy and threatened to have Tama chewed up by his lion. He also tried to threaten Luffy with the All-Stars, [[Jack]], who he warned is the ruler of [[Kuri]]. He grossly underestimated Luffy and was shocked to see how quickly he had snatched Tama away from his lion's mouth. He attempted to fight the Straw Hat captain but was quickly defeated by him.

Luffy loathes Holed'em for taking Tama away and grew irritated and angrier at his continuous threats of killing her with his lion. Despite the request of [[Kikunojo]] not to make Holed'em anymore angry, Luffy chose to rescue Tama and soon fought him after his anger with Holed'em escalated when Tama informed him that he had bruised her cheek with some pliers. Luffy proceeded to turn around and delivered a powerful Red-Hawk punch on the Shinuchi, defeating him immediately.

===Speed===
[[File:Luffy and Tama Ride Speed.png|thumb|250px|Luffy riding on Speed's back.]]

[[Speed]] is a Shinuchi of the [[Beasts Pirates]] and a supporting ally to Luffy after very briefly being his enemy. The two met following Luffy's victory over [[Holed'em]] during the [[Wano Country Arc]] when she was tamed by [[Kurozumi Tama|Tama]]. For the brief moment they were enemies, Speed was extremely hostile to Luffy and was annoyed by him, however, after Tama tamed her with her Devil Fruit powers, she becomes tolerable of Luffy but is still rude and disrespectful towards him.

Immediately following Luffy's victory against Holed'em he tried to escape [[Kuri|Bakura Town]] with Tama and decided to jump on Speed, assuming her to fully be a horse, but was shocked to find out she is actually a person. Luffy told Tama to tame her with her Devil Fruit powers and, once it worked, rode out of town on her back. Once they had arrived at [[Okobore Town]], Luffy had Speed return Tama back to her home. He ends up meeting Speed again after she was attacked by [[Kaidou]] and was carried back to Bakura Town where, whilst extremely injured, informed Luffy of what happened to her and Tama.

Speed watched as her fellow Shinuchi, Holed'em, was soundly defeated by Luffy and was shocked that he was defeated with a single blow, pondering who Luffy is. When Luffy hopped onto her she was momentarily flustered as he grabbed her waist but soon became angry that he was on her back and tried to push him off. Her attitude towards Luffy lightened after she was tamed by Tama, as she was willing to carry him alongside her new master, Tama, to safety. She continuously chastises Luffy and reminds him that she does not serve him as he is not her master. However, she felt some level of guilt for failing to keep Tama safe and sadly informed Luffy of her failure.

Luffy was shocked to discover that the horse he had jumped onto was actually a person. It was his idea to have her tamed by Tama so she could be an ally. He does not seem bothered by her backtalk towards him and trusted her enough to care for Tama and take her back home, although he later regretted not going with them after he discovered what Kaidou did to them. When he found Speed injured, he held her whilst she informed him of what happened to Tama and before fighting Kaidou. He moved her to safety before the [[Four Emperors|Emperor's]] Bolo Breath engulfed her.

===Basil Hawkins===
[[File:Luffy And Zoro vs Basil Hawkins.png|thumb|left|250px|Luffy and Zoro prepare to do battle with Basil Hawkins.]]

[[Basil Hawkins]] is a Shinuchi of the [[Beasts Pirates]], the [[Pirate Captain|captain]] of the [[Hawkins Pirates]], and a fellow member of the [[Worst Generation]]. The two have little relationship, instead just seeing each other as natural enemies due to their respective allegiances. Hawkins sees Luffy as a serious troublemaker and felt the need to try and stop his rampage on [[Wano Country|Wano]]. Luffy does not think much of Hawkins, having only encountered him briefly to fight some of his men before escaping.

Like Luffy, Basil Hawkins is a member of the Worst Generation and thus landed on [[Sabaody Archipelago]] with at least a {{B}}100,000,000 at the same time the Straw Hat captain did. Unlike many others, he did not panic when it was revealed that Luffy had assaulted a [[World Noble]] and decided to act in accordance with his Tarot Cards. He watched Luffy partake in the [[Summit War of Marineford]] and predicted his chances of surviving. He would not encounter Luffy until after he arrived in Wano, where he is now a member of the Beasts Pirates. He tried to stop Luffy, as well as [[Roronoa Zoro|Zoro]], but chose not to pursue them as his chances were slim. He continues to try and hinder Luffy and his allies attempts to remove [[Kaidou]] from Wano.

Hawkins seems to take a certain level of interest in Luffy. During the Summit War of Marineford he repeatedly tried to predict Luffy's survival chances with his Tarot Cards but no matter how hard he tried, his chances would never reach zero. Unlike a lot of the people Luffy has met, Hawkins seems to take Luffy's actions in stride rather than becoming unnerved, such as on Sabaody when he did not panic when the arrival of a [[Marine]] [[Admiral]] was imminent because Luffy had punched a World Noble. He also did not seem fazed by his arrival in Wano, instead treating him as another [[pirate]] he must defeat. Due to Hawkins' cautious nature, he is more than willing to let Luffy go free if he has had a bad reading on his Tarot Cards. Ultimately, however, he sees Luffy as his enemy and will try to see him captured, as he intervened in [[Trafalgar D. Water Law|Trafalgar Law]]'s rescue attempt of Luffy after he had been defeated by [[Kaidou]].

Luffy is mostly oblivious to who Basil Hawkins is, as he is with most members of the Worst Generation. However, when he met him for the first time in Wano, he seemed to be slightly aware of who he is. Nonetheless, he was eager to start fighting him and his men, despite [[Kin'emon]]'s warning to not cause any trouble whilst on Wano. He is confused by Hawkins' abilities, as he witnessed him using his unusual sword on the lizard, he had thrown at him, and became more confused when he saw Zoro had slashed him, but the damage transferred to one of his subordinates instead. Luffy chose to end his battle with Hawkins and fled as [[Kurozumi Tama|Tama]]'s health began to worsen.

===Dobon===
[[File:Luffy And Kid Fight Dobon.png|thumb|250px|Dobon attempts to defeat Luffy and Kid.]]

[[Dobon]] is a Shinuchi of the [[Beasts Pirates]], the vice-warden of the Prisoner Mine and a minor antagonist to Luffy during the [[Wano Country Arc]]. He has a hostile relationship with Luffy, something that is reciprocated by the Straw Hat captain. Dobon was furious with Luffy, as well as [[Eustass Kid]], for claiming all the dumplings, as well as for his discourteous attitude towards him. Luffy did not care very much about Dobon but was greatly angered for what he had done to [[Hyougoro]].

After being defeated and imprisoned by [[Kaidou]] and the Beast Pirates, Luffy managed to recover from his injuries and was able to work at an absurd rate inside the Prisoner Mine, allowing him to claim a large quantity of dumplings as payment. When Dobon arrived, he was furious to see that all but three dumplings were available for him and thus tried to attack Luffy and Kid. However, he was easily defeated by the pair and was knocked out.

Dobon was perhaps unaware of who Luffy actually is, due to the isolation of [[Wano Country]], and thus grossly underestimated him. Due to his position as vice-warden of the prison, he was incredibly antagonistic as he saw Luffy as just another prisoner. This helped fuel his anger when he discovered all the dumplings had been gone because, Luffy, a prisoner, claimed them all, alongside Kid. When he confronted Luffy, he was both flabbergasted, and annoyed, by Luffy's nonchalant attitude towards him. He was stunned when he first saw Luffy as he was incredibly fat, from eating all the dumplings, and was even more stunned when he quickly digested the food to return to his normal build. Nonetheless, he tried to attack Luffy and Kid but was quickly defeated.

Luffy did not care who Dobon was, as he cares very little about the actual authority of the Prisoner Mine. He paid little attention to his complaints about him and Kid eating all the dumplings. However, he was notably angry when he saw Hyougoro laid helplessly below Dobon's feet, injured. Deducing that Dobon was the one responsible for his injuries, he worked with Kid to quickly, and effortlessly, defeat the vice warden whilst inside his “Slaughter Room”.

==Cross Guild==
===Buggy===
[[File:Buggy and Luffy.png|thumb|left|250px|A typical moment between Luffy and Buggy.]]

[[Buggy]] is the [[Pirate Captain|captain]] of the [[Buggy Pirates]], the head of [[Buggy's Delivery]], an [[Four Emperors|Emperor]], a former [[Seven Warlords of the Sea|Warlord]], and a former [[Pirate Apprentice|apprentice]] of the [[Roger Pirates]]. The two share an antagonistic relationship but have been able to work as allies. Buggy finds Luffy irritating in a similar way he finds his old crew mate, [[Shanks]], irritating. However, he is willing to work with Luffy if it is to his benefit. Nonetheless, he strongly dislikes Luffy for all the trouble he has caused him and has spent some of his time chasing after the Straw Hat captain to kill him. Luffy did not initially like Buggy and saw him as an enemy, but has since dropped his hostility and has grown to tolerate him.

The two first met during the [[Orange Town Arc]] where Buggy and his crew were causing trouble for the residents there. With the help of [[Nami]] and [[Roronoa Zoro|Zoro]], Luffy was able to defeat the Buggy Pirates and liberate [[Orange Town]]. After going through the trouble of reassembling his body, Buggy followed Luffy to [[Loguetown]] whilst having also made an alliance with [[Alvida]], who is also searching for Luffy. Whilst in Loguetown, he successfully trapped Luffy atop [[Gol D. Roger]]'s execution platform and attempted to execute the Straw Hat captain but was miraculously prevented from doing so. The two would not cross paths again until the [[Impel Down Arc]] where Buggy reluctantly worked with Luffy to escape the infamous prison and follow him to the [[Summit War of Marineford]], with Buggy carrying him and [[Jinbe]] to safety towards the end of the battle.

Buggy strongly disliked Luffy when he first met him because the Straw Hat captain insulted his nose, something he is sensitive about. After losing to him, he remained bitter and spent half of his time hunting down the Straw Hat captain, even allying with Alvida, who also wished to find Luffy, in order to achieve this goal. However, circumstances always got in his way and he found his attempts to ultimately be futile. He is often annoyed by Luffy's reckless and careless decisions, such as when they arrived at the Summit War of Marineford atop a frozen wave and he suggested breaking it, causing him, and everyone else, to fall towards the battlefield. He was also greatly annoyed when Luffy used his body as a shield in his fight against [[Dracule Mihawk]]. 

By the time he met him again in [[Impel Down]], Buggy had softened somewhat, and was more than willing to work with Luffy in order to escape but was frustrated as he kept finding himself going deeper and deeper in to the prison. Buggy, at one point, acknowledged how much stronger Luffy had gotten since they both fought each other. Despite his great annoyance and occasional hostility with Luffy, he agreed to save his life when he and Jinbe were hurled towards him by [[Crocodile]] and carried them to [[Trafalgar D. Water Law|Trafalgar Law]]'s [[Polar Tang|submarine]].{{Qref|chap=580|ep=489}} He even returned Luffy's straw hat after Shanks bribed him to do so. Earlier in the conflict, he desperately tried to tell Luffy to be quiet when he was backtalking the [[Four Emperors|emperor]], [[Edward Newgate|Whitebeard]], and was shocked when the two started talking on friendly terms. When he found out Luffy's father is [[Monkey D. Dragon]] he was left utterly astonished and commented that his father is a big deal.{{Qref|chap=558|Luffy is Dragon's son.}} Buggy has also benefitted from Luffy's actions, as he saw an increase in business for his dispatch company after Luffy had defeated his fellow Warlord of the Sea, [[Donquixote Doflamingo]], in [[Dressrosa]].

Luffy originally disliked Buggy and his crew for the mayhem they caused in [[Orange Town]]. He became furious with Buggy when he pierced his straw hat that was given to him by Shanks. However, once he had defeated him, he no longer had any serious hostility towards him, and was rather nonchalant about Buggy's attempt to execute him in Loguetown. When he met Buggy again in Impel Down, he agreed to a truce and worked alongside him to make his way down towards [[Portgas D. Ace|Ace]]'s level. He happily gave away the armband to Buggy, that was given to him by Nami, in exchange for his aid. Either due to his obliviousness, or simply not caring, Luffy does not show any annoyance with Buggy's attempts to leave him behind, and still treats him as an ally. However, he was annoyed when Buggy revealed to him that he had lied about knowing how to get to level four of Impel Down. Luffy was grateful for Buggy's aid, as when his old nemesis revealed his intention to abandon him, along with [[Galdino|Mr. 3]], he simply thanked him for getting him this far. When he used Buggy as a human shield against Dracule Mihawk, that eventually led to Buggy comically being blown up by his own attack, Luffy ran off, stating he would never forget him.​

Two years later, following the events of Raid on Onigashima, Luffy saw Buggy's new organization called Cross Guild and has two former Warlords Mihawk and Crocodile serving under him. Compare to everyone's surprised and shocked expressions about the new Emperor, Luffy did not think of Buggy much, calling him a moron, and even expressed his belief that Buggy's ascension ​to the title of Emperor as ingenuine, something that Nami agreed.

On the opposite site, Buggy recognized Luffy alongside the 2 other Emperors Shanks and Blackbeard as contestants for the run to claim the One Piece, wanting to outrun him by finding the One Piece first, to the dismay of Crocodile and Mihawk.

===Alvida===
[[File:Luffy Fights Alvida.png|thumb|250px|Alvida attempts to defeat Luffy.]]

[[Alvida]] is the former [[Pirate Captain|captain]] of the [[Alvida Pirates]], a captain in the [[Buggy and Alvida Alliance]], an administrator of the [[Buggy's Delivery]] and one of the first antagonists Luffy made out at sea. Alvida sees Luffy as an enemy but has also fallen for him, and is greatly intrigued by that Straw Hat captain, as he left a strong impression on Alvida by being the first man to defeat her. Luffy does not think anything of Alvida, as he found her to be annoying and bluntly insulted her, before effortlessly defeating her. He has since mostly forgotten who she is.

The two met when her crew picked up a barrel that contained Luffy and stored it inside the warehouse at her camp. Once he broke free, and had befriended [[Koby]], she stumbled onto Luffy and began to attack him but was shocked to find her attacks did nothing to the [[Gomu Gomu no Mi|rubber man]]. He then quickly defeated her and left her camp, along with Koby. The two crossed paths again in [[Loguetown]], after she had allied with [[Buggy]], and watched as her new partner attempted to execute Luffy but was stunned to see he had miraculously survived. She fled the town and has since joined Buggy in their pursuit of finding him again.

Initially, Alvida hated Luffy for openly calling her fat, and shattering her vanity, as she had created a culture among her crew to constantly refer to her as the most beautiful woman on the seas. This led to her to attack Luffy in a fit of anger but was quickly beaten. She was shocked to find he is made of rubber and her attacks could do nothing to hurt him. Following her defeat, she went through a drastic appearance change by eating the Devil Fruit, the [[Sube Sube no Mi]], losing a lot of weight. She had become infatuated with Luffy and wishes to find him, either to kill him or make him hers. Because of these feelings, she was somewhat disgruntled by Buggy's attempt to try and kill him but ultimately accepted it. Following the failed attempt, she has continued to try and find Luffy but has been distracted by her business with Buggy.

Luffy is not at all interested in her, and found her to be annoying when they first met. He was happy to see Koby stand up to her and quickly defeated Alvida after taking a painless blow from her. When he met her again in Loguetown he had completely forgotten who she is and struggled to remember due to her drastic appearance change.

===Dracule Mihawk===
[[File:Kokuto Kogetsu.png|thumb|left|250px|Mihawk attacks Luffy.]]
[[Dracule Mihawk]] is a former [[Seven Warlords of the Sea|Warlord of the Sea]] and the current holder of the title "World's Strongest Swordsman". Their relationship is mostly neutral, as Mihawk and Luffy do not really see each other as enemies, but have fought each other on one occasion. Mihawk has an interest in Luffy due to his connection with the [[Four Emperors|emperor]], [[Shanks]], and has a growing suspicion that Luffy is favored by fate. What Luffy thinks of Mihawk has never been stated but he acknowledges Mihawk's incredible strength. He was briefly angry with the Warlord when he believed he had killed his crew mate, [[Roronoa Zoro|Zoro]].

The two first met during the [[Baratie Arc]] when Mihawk arrived to finish destroying [[Krieg|Don Krieg]]'s [[Krieg Pirates|fleet]]. Luffy's crew mate, Zoro, challenged Mihawk to a duel and convincingly lost. Following his battle, Mihawk also interacted with Luffy and took note of his determination to become the [[Pirate#Pirate King|Pirate King]]. The two crossed paths again during the [[Summit War of Marineford]] where Mihawk chased down Luffy to see how much fate favors him, but much to his intrigue, found that people kept getting in his way in order to save him. When he returned to his home on [[Kuraigana Island]], he found Luffy's crew mate, Zoro, and agreed to train him after noting his desire to become stronger for Luffy's sake.

Mihawk took an interest in Luffy after he told him that his dream is to become the Pirate King and showed that he is unfazed by the difficulty of the challenge. Shanks had once told Mihawk about a "curious kid in a [[Foosha Village|small village]]" and realized that Luffy was that same kid after first meeting him at the [[Baratie]]. He traveled to where Shanks was camping with his [[Red Haired Pirates|crew]] and gave him Luffy's first [[Bounties#Identification|wanted poster]]. It also appears that Mihawk believes in Luffy's, as well as the [[Straw Hat Pirates]]', potential, and has kept tabs on their activities. He even once bothered to attend a Seven Warlords of the Sea meeting with the [[Marines]] after Luffy had defeated [[Crocodile]], saying he had a particular interest in the pirates on the meeting’s agenda. During the Summit War of Marineford, Mihawk was amused by Luffy's unorthodox entrance and was not surprised at the revelation that [[Monkey D. Dragon]] is Luffy's father. He openly tried to kill Luffy throughout the battle just to see how fate favors him and complimented the Straw Hat captain on his abilities, especially for not being as reckless in battle as he originally believed him to be. It was during his attempt to take down Luffy, and being stopped by numerous people, that he came to the realization of what truly makes Luffy so powerful, stating that its not some cheap trick but it is his ability to turn everyone around him into an ally.

Despite rarely interacting with Mihawk, Luffy has come to fully acknowledge his immense power and tried to avoid fighting him during the Summit War of Marineford, openly stating he does not have time to fight someone as strong as him. When he first met Mihawk, he went into a rage when he believed he had killed Zoro, but was relieved to see he had allowed his crewmate to live. When challenged by the Warlord of the Sea about his dream to become the Pirate King, Luffy simply shrugged off his warnings and remained undeterred by what he said, leaving a positive impression on Mihawk.

Unlike Buggy, Mihawk recognized Luffy's status as one of the Four Emperors as generally well earned for defeating [[Kaidou]]. But Mihawk had no interest to go pick a fight with Luffy.

===Galdino===
[[File:Luffy And Galdino.png|thumb|250px|Luffy and Galdino whilst in Impel Down.]]

[[Galdino]], otherwise known as Mr. 3, is a former [[Baroque Works]] agent, a member of the [[Buggy Pirates]] and an administrator of [[Buggy's Delivery]]. He was an enemy to Luffy during the [[Little Garden Arc]] and an ally during the [[Impel Down Arc]] and [[Marineford Arc]]. The two share an antagonistic, but also friendly, relationship. Galdino found Luffy to be a difficult opponent on [[Little Garden]], and becomes frequently annoyed by his habit of putting him in danger. Luffy disliked Galdino for trying to kill his friends, but was more than willing to work alongside him when escaping from Impel Down and fighting at the [[Summit War of Marineford]].

The two first met on Little Garden when Galdino was trying to kill [[Roronoa Zoro|Zoro]], [[Nami]] and [[Nefertari Vivi|Vivi]], angering Luffy. He was defeated by the Straw Hat captain and had to escape from Little Garden before his fellow agent, [[Bentham|Mr. 2]], tried to kill him. He arrived in [[Arabasta]] but was thrown into a tank full of Bananawanis by [[Crocodile]], but managed to survive and was inadvertently saved by [[Sanji]] who then forced him to create a key to help Luffy, and the others, escape from Crocodile's hideout. The two met again in Impel Down where Galdino reluctantly worked alongside Luffy to escape the infamous prison and traveled with the Straw Hat captain to the Summit War of Marineford, he ended up playing the most vital role in freeing [[Portgas D. Ace]] as he created a copy of the key to his [[seastone]] handcuffs so he could be freed. Since the time-skip, he has since joined [[Buggy]]'s crew and works alongside him in his business, Buggy's Delivery.

Galdino was very antagonistic towards Luffy during the Little Garden arc, often patronizing the Straw Hat captain and grossly underestimating Luffy's abilities. He maintained his dislike of Luffy even throughout their escape from Impel Down despite having apparently “forgiven” him for his actions, as he quickly befriended Buggy through their shared hatred of him. However, he tends to be inconsistent about his attitude towards the Straw Hat captain, as by the time of the Impel Down arc he was notably less antagonistic and was willing to aid Luffy, as he used his [[Doru Doru no Mi|Devil Fruit]] abilities to help take down a [[Minotaurus]] and even blocked a coat of poison aimed at Luffy using his wax, as he felt he owed the Straw Hat captain a debt. He was aware of his actions, however, and noted he should be careful or he’ll start to think of Luffy as a friend. Following Bentham's sacrifice, he became determined to aid Luffy during the Summit War of Marineford in honor of his friend, as he willingly tried to disguise himself as one of the executioners to save Luffy's brother, Ace, and produced a copy of the key to his brother's seastone handcuffs that allowed him to escape. He also indirectly aided Luffy as he freed [[Marco]] from his seastone handcuffs who later held off [[Admiral]] [[Sakazuki|Akainu]] whilst Luffy was being carried to safety.

It appears he is also inspired by Luffy, as by the time of the Impel Down arc he had become notably more cowardly, but found motivation to risk his life in order to escape thanks to Luffy's sheer determination. He is willing to listen to Luffy's orders as he agreed to provide boxing gloves and boots out of his wax so he could fight [[Magellan]], and when Luffy was about to block a punch from [[Marine Ranks#Fleet Admiral|Fleet Admiral]] [[Sengoku]] he listened to Luffy's order to create a coat of wax to protect Ace. He is also surprised at Luffy's abilities, as he was stunned that Luffy could defeat him in his wax armor and was left perplexed when he made duplicates of himself only to still be instantly beaten by Luffy, not understanding how he guessed right simply off his instincts. When he heard that Luffy is the son of the leader of the [[Revolutionary Army]], [[Monkey D. Dragon]], he was completely shaken, and could not believe that he personally knew Luffy. He was happy to hear Luffy say he would not laugh at his desire to free Ace in order to honor Bentham's sacrifice, and demanded Luffy to save his brother.

Luffy disliked Galdino for what he was trying to do to his friends and for dishonoring the fight between the two [[giants]] on Little Garden who he had befriended. This eventually led to Luffy defeating Galdino, but then chased down the Baroque Works agent and defeated him once again. By the time of the Impel Down arc, Luffy had dropped any animosity towards him and was more than happy to work alongside him during the escape, finding him to be an incredibly useful ally and appreciated his help in defeating the Minotaurus and later to fight Magellan. He even chose to stay by Galdino's side whilst he held off Magellan as he realized he could not defeat him on his own. He was overjoyed when he saw Galdino atop Ace's platform and became extraordinarily grateful when he provided a copy of the key to Ace’s shackles. Luffy made sure to keep hold of Galdino as he was carried by Ace to safety, not wanting to let his ally perish.

Luffy always refers Galdino as "Three".

===Crocodile===
[[File:Luffy Kicks Crocodile.png|thumb|left|230px|Luffy fighting Crocodile for the third time and managing to exploit his weakness.]]

[[Crocodile]] is the former President of [[Baroque Works]], a former [[Seven Warlords of the Sea|Warlord of the Sea]], a [[pirate]], and the antagonist of the [[Arabasta Arc]]. He was the very first foe Luffy lost a fight to, having done so twice. The two disliked each other throughout the Arabasta Arc but became temporary allies during their escape from [[Impel Down]] and throughout the [[Summit War of Marineford]]. Luffy hated him for the chaos he caused [[Nefertari Vivi]] and her [[Arabasta Kingdom|kingdom]] and swore to defeat him for her sake. To Crocodile, Luffy was just a naive rookie who knew nothing of the real world out at sea, but ended up underestimating him.

He was able to defeat Luffy comfortably in their first fight but underestimated Luffy's will power and determination and gave him the opportunity to recover. He fought him a second time and was able to win yet again, but still made the same mistake of not finishing off the Straw Hat captain, allowing him to recover once more to finally be defeated by him. The two met again when Luffy broke into Impel Down to save his brother and discovered Crocodile on the bottom level. Luffy reluctantly allowed him to be released and worked with him to escape and to try and rescue his brother, Ace.

Crocodile dislikes Luffy but also has a begrudging respect for the young rookie. He normally keeps a calm and composed persona, but Luffy is able to get under his skin as he bit his cigar clean in half when Luffy called him stupid, which caused [[Nico Robin]] to chuckle. He acknowledges Luffy's tenacity and believes he is worthy enough for him to reveal his poisonous hook to him, something he rarely uses in his fights. He believed that Luffy's determination to become the [[Pirate#Pirate King|Pirate King]] was weak and that he would soon forgo this desire once he discovered what the seas are truly like. By the time he meets Luffy again in Impel Down he has seemingly dropped any grudge he had against him, possibly due to seeing him as his only means of escape. However, he chose to be a helpful ally for Luffy and aided him even during the Summit War of Marineford. This in spite of being greatly annoyed when Luffy interfered in his attempt to kill [[Edward Newgate|Whitebeard]].

Whilst escaping Impel Down he provided plenty of help and worked alongside Luffy and [[Jinbe]] in defeating the prison guards and the various other enemies that got in their way. During the Summit War of Marineford he took on [[Dracule Mihawk|Mihawk]] in order to protect Luffy from the powerful Warlord and used his [[Suna Suna no Mi|Devil Fruit]] powers to prevent [[Portgas D. Ace|Ace]] from being executed, although with the latter he claimed it was because he did not wish to see the [[Marines]] enjoy victory. Whilst Jinbe was trying to escape with Luffy he came to the Straw Hat captain's aid and frustrated Admiral [[Sakazuki|Akainu]]'s attempts to kill them, even working alongside the [[Whitebeard Pirates]] to do so despite having a strong hatred for them. Since the war, Crocodile has kept up to date on Luffy's exploits, particularly in [[Totto Land]].

Luffy despised Crocodile for the chaos he caused for Vivi and her kingdom and became extremely angry when Crocodile revealed he is responsible for [[Yuba]]'s plight with sandstorms. He was also annoyed by Crocodile's taunts that were directed at Vivi. Although he was willing to agree with him that Vivi is naive for believing she could stop the incoming civil war without bloodshed, he still found his actions intolerable. By the time he came across Crocodile again in Impel Down, Luffy was not willing to trust him and had to be convinced by [[Emporio Ivankov]] that he would keep him in check before letting him out. He chose to stop Crocodile's attempt to kill Whitebeard and bluntly told him that he would not allow him to attack the emperor because of how much Ace cares for him. Overall, despite the disagreements he has with him, Luffy was accepting of working alongside him throughout his endeavor to save Ace and was appreciative when he came to his aid against Mihawk.

Unlike Buggy, Crocodile doesn't seem to have grudge on Luffy for stopping his [[Operation Utopia]] nor does he have any interest to claim his head due to him considering Luffy's status as an Emperor to be generally well earned after defeating Kaidou.

==Overview==
Naturally, Luffy being a pirate has earned the [[Straw Hat Pirates|Straw Hat]] captain their ire. However, due to his actions, and unintentional declaration of war against them, he has incited their fury towards him. Officials of the [[World Government]] up and down the apparatus all wish to see Luffy eliminated and have dedicated most of their time trying to do so, having rapidly increased his [[Bounties|bounty]] to {{B}}3,000,000,000 and became one of the [[Four Emperors]].

A number of Luffy's actions against the World Government include breaking into [[Enies Lobby]], burning their flag, defeating [[Rob Lucci]] of [[CP9]] and reclaiming [[Nico Robin]] into his crew. He then assaulted a [[World Noble|Celestial Dragon]] on [[Sabaody Archipelago]]. Following this, he infiltrated [[Impel Down]] and escaped with some of the most notorious criminals. He joined the [[Summit War of Marineford]] on the side of the [[Whitebeard Pirates]], and has defeated three of the [[Seven Warlords of the Sea|Seven Warlords]]: [[Crocodile]], [[Gecko Moria]] and [[Donquixote Doflamingo]]. Because of this, they see him as a major threat and a bringer of chaos, as well as someone who has threatened to upset the power balance between the [[Three Great Powers]] when he challenged [[Charlotte Linlin|Big Mom]].

Luffy does not like the World Government, but does not necessarily hate them either. He does not think of them as an entity to hate, but instead hates the individuals that threaten him or his friends, or commit acts he finds atrocious, who also happen to be part of the World Government. This has allowed him to make temporary and permanent allies, friends and acquaintances within the organization and their affiliates, such as [[Koby]], [[Helmeppo]], his grandfather [[Monkey D. Garp]], [[Smoker]], [[Tashigi]], the [[Admiral]] [[Issho|Fujitora]], members of the Seven Warlords, Crocodile, [[Boa Hancock]], [[Jinbe]], [[Trafalgar D. Water Law]], and [[Buggy]], as well as kingdoms such as [[Arabasta Kingdom|Arabasta]], [[Dressrosa]], [[Sakura Kingdom|Sakura]], [[Ryugu Kingdom|Ryugu]] and their respective rulers.

==Management==
===Five Elders===
The [[Five Elders]] are the second highest-ranking leaders of the World Government, serving only under the mysterious [[Imu]]. They are each other's natural enemies, with the Five Elders greatly fearing Luffy's rising influence in the world as it is a threat to their corrupt world order. As such, they pay great attention to his exploits and rapidly increase his bounty in the hopes of him being captured or killed.

The Five Elders have been keeping close tabs on Luffy and his progression throughout the world. They see him as a nuisance and a threat to the [[World Government]] and the balance of power among the [[Three Great Powers]]. Due to Luffy having the initial "[[Will of D.|D.]]" in his name and being the son of [[Monkey D. Dragon]], the head of the [[Revolutionary Army]] and the World Government's greatest enemy, they have labelled Luffy a "Dangerous Future Element."

They first noted Luffy after he defeated [[Crocodile]]{{Qref|chap=233}} and have followed his various actions against them since, such as infiltrating [[Enies Lobby]],{{Qref|chap=376}} burning the flag of the World Government,{{Qref|chap=398}} defeating [[Rob Lucci]] and saving [[Nico Robin]],{{Qref|chap=427|chap2=429}} followed by an assault on a fellow [[World Noble|Celestial Dragon]] while on the [[Sabaody Archipelago]]{{Qref|chap=502}} as well as his breaking into [[Impel Down]]{{Qref|chap=526}} and causing a mass breakout, followed immediately by him joining the [[Summit War of Marineford]]{{Qref|chap=557}} to try and rescue his brother, [[Portgas D. Ace|Ace]], and for defeating three members of the Seven Warlords: Crocodile,{{Qref|chap=210}} Gecko Moria,{{Qref|chap=482}} and Donquixote Doflamingo.{{Qref|chap=790}} They were notably angry, and shocked, when they discovered that Luffy had defeated Doflamingo,{{Qref|chap=793}} cursing the [[Straw Hat Pirates|Straw Hat]] captain and calling him a brat.

[[File:Saturn Targets Luffy.png|thumb|left|210px|Saturn targets Luffy.]]

It is apparent that they greatly fear Luffy's potential and even ordered [[CP0]], the highest agency within the World Government, to eliminate Luffy as he battled [[Kaidou]], due to the risk of him winning and disrupting the balance of power in the world.{{Qref|chap=1041}} The fear they feel for Luffy is so great that they were more than willing to arouse Kaidou's wrath and potentially cause a mass war against the same, as well as losing one of their top agents in the process just to make sure Luffy would be eliminated for good.  One of the primary reasons they fear Luffy is because of the true nature of his Devil Fruit power, which when awakened, will grant him "the most ridiculous power in the world."{{Qref|chap=1044}} Shortly following Luffy's victory over Kaidou, they became aware that their biggest fear has become a reality, as Luffy has successfully awoken his devil fruit powers and attained [[Gomu Gomu no Mi/Gear 5 Techniques|Gear 5]], granting him powers of the Sun God, [[Nika]].{{Qref|chap=1044|chap2=1045}} 

When Luffy later temporarily disrupted their plans by capturing York, they were first formally introduced to Luffy, making it their first exchange, during which they tried to persuade him to reveal crucial information, though they were unable to do so. Later, when Saturn arrived at Egghead, he saw Luffy in his Gear 5 form, he immediately recognized him as "Nika". Seeing Luffy severely weakened from his battle with Kizaru, Saturn attempted to kill him, only for Franky to foil him. Shortly after Saturn was bewildered when he spotted that Luffy somehow acquired food and ordered him to be detained, though he ultimately managed to escape his sight. Once Luffy returned in his Gear 5 form once more spotting Bonney and an Injured Vegapunk, Saturn called him and Bonney "stupid insects" that deserved death, Saturn then used his ability to wound Luffy but it proved useless as the Emperor struck him with multiple powerful blows causing him to be launched through a building. Saturn then returned enraged and in his full beast transformation as he attempted to kill Luffy again with multiple poisonous venom tainted strikes, though was restrained when Luffy entered into his Giant form.{{Qref|name=c1108}} Afterword Saturn summoned the rest of the Five Elders in their awakened form onto deal with Luffy and Vegapunk's pre recorded broadcast. Luffy then dealt with [[Topman Warcury]] and [[Shepherd Ju Peter]] with the help of [[Dorry]] and [[Brogy]].

===World Nobles===
The [[World Noble|World Nobles]], also known as Celestial Dragons, are the highest nobility in the world, sitting right below the Five Elders. Because of their actions on [[Sabaody Archipelago]], particularly what the Celestial Dragon, [[Charlos]], did to [[Hatchan]], they incurred Luffy's wrath, with Charlos being sent crashing through rows of seats and into a wall after the [[Straw Hat Pirates|Straw Hat]] captain punched him.

So far, it appears that the World Nobles do not have a say in the policies of the World Government, aside from the Five Elders. As a result, most of them are not necessarily responsible for the World Government's actions against Luffy. They do, however, have the right to call an [[admiral]] to do their bidding should they wish it, and this was seen when Admiral [[Borsalino|Kizaru]] was called to Sabaody Archipelago after Luffy's actions against Charlos. During the [[Summit War of Marineford]], Kizaru stated that the World Nobles have been itching to see Luffy arrested.

Luffy has flat out stated he hates the World Nobles. This began when he witnessed Shalria abusing a slave, [[Devil Dias]], and barely held back by others from lunging forward. This escalated beyond all restraints when Charlos shoots and mocks Hatchan, who he was now friends with. Such was his anger, he was willing to punch the Celestial Dragon despite knowing the consequences of doing so. He was later informed by [[Boa Hancock]] of the atrocities they committed to her and her sisters, despising them even more. When he discovered that Doflamingo is a former Celestial Dragon, his hatred for him grew, especially when Doflamingo continued to banter about how his heritage gives him rights above all others. It's unknown how he felt about [[Donquixote Homing]], considering he was the first World Noble to willingly stray away from the group in exchange for a normal life, though Luffy did seem rather displeased that his son murdered his father despite the latter trying to save the rest of his family.

Luffy has nothing but complete hatred and absolute disdain for the World Nobles, and unlike other people who dare not attack for fear of the Admirals, Luffy is more than willing to attack them without worrying about the consequences. When he found out about the [[Nefertari Cobra]]'s death, he was more than willing to invade Mary Geoise and openly declare a mass war against the Holy Land.

====Saint Charlos====
[[File:Luffy_Punches_Charlos.png|thumb|210px|Luffy sends Charlos flying with a punch.]]

Saint Charlos is a World Noble and a brief, minor, antagonist to Luffy on [[Sabaody Archipelago]]. The two absolutely hate one another and earned each other's anger whilst on Sabaody. Charlos despises Luffy for both standing up to him and defying him. Whilst Luffy loathes Charlos for shooting his friend, Hatchan, and for his completely deplorable personality and cruelty.

Whilst on Sabaody, Luffy crashed landed inside the [[Human Auction House]] where Charlos and his family were. Luffy was looking to rescue [[Camie]], who was being auctioned off, ironically to Charlos, but was stopped by Hatchan who did not want Luffy to anger the World Nobles present but in the process revealed himself to be a [[Fish-Men|fish-man]]. Due to the severe discrimination of fish-men, he was hounded by the crowd and gleefully shot by Charlos, which earned him Luffy's wrath.

Charlos has only interacted with Luffy once, very briefly. However, due to his extreme sense of entitlement and narcissism, he immediately hated Luffy, not just for defending the fish-man he just shot, but for also looking directly at him and defying his command. As Luffy stormed towards him, he tried to shoot at the Straw Hat captain but quickly began to panic when Luffy dodged his shots before being punched by him. According to Admiral [[Borsalino|Kizaru]], during the [[Summit War of Marineford]], the World Nobles have been itching to see Luffy apprehended ever since.

Luffy has nothing but complete and utter contempt for Charlos, as well for the World Nobles at large. He believes them to be completely deplorable people after witnessing their rotten personalities before himself. After he saw Charlos shoot Hatchan, and proceeded to mock and taunt his friend, he became filled with immense rage that compelled him to walk up to the World Noble and deliver a powerful punch to his face, knocking him out. Such was his hatred he did all this despite knowing the full consequences. He made it clear to [[Boa Hancock]] that he had no regrets about punching Charlos as he completely deserved it. Upon hearing Hancock's story about being tortured by a World Noble as a child, he has grown to hate them even more.

==Employees==
===Magellan===
[[File:Monkey D. Luffy Hits Magellan With Gomu Gomu no Jet Bazooka.png|thumb|left|250px|Luffy lands a hit on Magellan.]]

[[Magellan]] is the Vice Warden and the former Chief Warden of [[Impel Down]], who became a natural antagonist to Luffy during the [[Impel Down Arc]]. The two see each other as nothing but enemies and actively worked to overcome each other. Magellan found Luffy's willingness to break into his prison, and being the first to do so, infuriating and bewildering, and was determined to know how the [[Straw Hat Pirates|Straw Hat]] [[Pirate Captain|captain]] managed to infiltrate his prison. Luffy found him to be a strong opponent when he fought him and came to acknowledge that he is a tough person to face and a pain in his plans to save his brother, [[Portgas D. Ace|Ace]].

Before they met, Magellan was made aware of Luffy's infiltration and was angered by the news. He prepared the troops of Impel Down to intercept him and eventually met Luffy in the kitchen on the fourth floor. The two fought each other and Magellan emerged the victor. Much to his shock, Luffy was not only able to survive his [[Doku Doku no Mi|poison]] but also reached level 6 of his prison. Luffy ultimately escaped his prison thanks to the help of [[Bentham|Bon Clay]] and his makeshift crew of notorious criminals.

Magellan dislikes Luffy and has taken personal offence to him breaking the prison's perfect record since [[Shiki]]'s escape, and, by extension, damaging his reputation. He was amazed by Luffy's tenacity and reckless attempts to attack him, as Luffy decided to punch him with his jet gatling despite coming into contact with Magellan's poisonous body. Having robbed Luffy of his sight, hearing, and control of his hands, he was left stunned that Luffy still attempted to try and fight him, due to him being amazed by his mental strength. Luffy never defeated Magellan, but his success in escaping Impel Down destroyed his standing with the [[World Government]] who demoted him to Vice-Warden of Impel Down and replacing him with his subordinate, and previous Vice-Warden, [[Hannyabal]].

When faced with Magellan, Luffy remained to determined to fight him and save his brother despite the warnings of his friend, Bon Clay. Even though the power gap between them was too big for him to overcome, he was not afraid of Magellan and refused to inform him of how he infiltrated his prison, wishing to protect [[Boa Hancock]]. He ultimately tried to overwhelm the Warden of Impel Down with a barrage of attacks but this proved to be futile and he was quickly defeated. He never thought much of Magellan after that as he was focused on making sure to escape Impel Down and catch up to Ace in order to save him. He fought Magellan a second time and although he was able to fight him more evenly, thanks to [[Galdino|Mr. 3]], he was still no match for the Warden and ultimately decided to flee with the help of [[Emporio Ivankov]]. Luffy inadvertently gained a benefit of his encounter with Magellan, as he developed an extremely strong resistance to [[poison]].

===Cipher Pol===
[[Cipher Pol]] is a agency of the [[World Government]] that exists explicitly to complete secret tasks given to them by the World Government. They do not answer to the [[Marines]], instead they appear to answer directly to the [[Five Elders]]. Luffy is a natural enemy of Cipher Pol, being a [[pirate]], but also because the World Government views Luffy as a serious threat. The two clashed in [[Water 7]] and [[Enies Lobby]], when [[CP9]] attempted to apprehend Nico Robin, and would cross paths again on [[Wano Country]].

Though Cipher Pol have agencies stretching from [[CP0|0]] all the way to 9, Luffy has only encountered CP9, [[Cipher Pol#CP6|CP6]], and CP0, with the former headed by Rob Lucci,{{Qref|chap=345}} who acted as the main antagonist of the [[Water 7 Arc]] and [[Enies Lobby Arc]]. CP6 were part of the escort team for [[Franky]] and [[Nico Robin|Robin]] but were detached from the [[Sea Train]] whilst on their way to Enies Lobby and then had their carts cut in half by Luffy and [[Roronoa Zoro|Zoro]].{{Qref|chap=371}} CP0 were involved in events in Wano{{Qref|chap=929}} and attempted to secure [[Kaidou]]'s victory over the Straw Hat captain,{{Qref|chap=1042}} however, this effort failed and cost them a senior agent in the process.{{Qref|chap=1043}} It would be CP0 that reported the events on [[Onigashima]] and Luffy's victory over Kaidou and attaining the form of the sun god, [[Nika]].{{Qref|chap=1052}}

Cipher Pol do not hold any particular dislike or hate towards Luffy and the [[Straw Hat Pirates|Straw Hats]]. Unlike the Marines, they exist to execute covert missions for the World Government, meaning that they would not try to apprehend Luffy unless specifically ordered to do so. They ended up becoming enemies of Luffy for taking Nico Robin from him and his crew.{{Qref|chap=325}} They antagonized Luffy, and the Straw Hats, when the CP0 division appeared on Wano and attempted to apprehend Nico Robin once more,{{Qref|chap=1030|chap2=1031}} as well as to help Kaidou in order to maintain the balance of power in the world.

Luffy greatly dislikes Cipher Pol, particularly CP9 and their agents, for their actions in Water 7, having falsely accused him and his crew of trying to assassinate [[Iceburg]], and for destroying [[Galley-La Headquarters]].{{Qref|chap=336}} CP9's loss to Luffy and the Straw Hats caused inside turmoil for Cipher Pol, resulting in the pursuit of Rob Lucci and his former comrades of CP9,{{Qref|chap=494}} and a reshuffling of agents that eventually allowed Lucci to return as a member of CP0.{{Qref|chap=907}} However, when his fight with Kaidou was interfered by a CP0 agent, Luffy seemed to quickly forget about the incident and accepted Kaidou's apology for what they did.{{Qref|chap=1044}}

====Rob Lucci====
[[File:Luffy_and_Lucci_Clash.png|thumb|250px|Rob Lucci and Luffy clash.]]
Luffy first met Rob Lucci in Water 7 when he was undercover as a carpenter for [[Galley-La Company|Galley-La]]. He would eventually fight him once his identity was revealed, with Lucci comfortably defeating the Straw Hat captain. Later he eventually met Lucci again after he had stormed the base of Enies Lobby, with the then-CP9 agent pleased to face the Straw Hat captain again. After a grueling battle, Luffy was eventually able to defeat the notorious agent of CP9 and save Robin. Subsequently, Lucci would be made a fugitive of the World Government but was soon brought back in as a member of CP0.

Lucci looked down on Luffy and regularly mocked him, continuously commenting that he was too weak to defeat him and save his friend. However, despite his personal animosity towards Luffy, he was clearly excited at the prospect of fighting him again after he had caught up to him, [[Spandam]] and Robin whilst on Enies Lobby. This likely indicates that, despite what he says, he sees Luffy as a worthy opponent. Whilst fighting Luffy he was impressed by his abilities and was stunned when he was able to take multiple hits of his Sai Dai Rin: Rokuogan. He had also praised Luffy for his leadership skills and states he is cut out to be the [[Pirate Captain|captain]] of his crew, even wishing a certain idiot (Spandam) could bear witness to him. Due to his defeat at the hands of Luffy, which also meant that his five-year mission had ended in failure, he was made into a fugitive and was pursued by Spandam and varying members of [[Cipher Pol]] until he joined CP0. 

Luffy hates the then-CP9-now-CP0 agent Rob Lucci for not only taking Robin away from his crew, but also because of his attempts to kill [[Iceburg]] and frame the Straw Hats, destroying [[Galley-La Headquarters]] and betraying the people of Galley-La. He found Rob Lucci to be his toughest opponent pre-timeskip, as he was pushed well beyond his limits by the then-CP9 agent and took an incredible amount of damage from him. However, he was ultimately thankful that he had met him, as their fight helped to make him stronger and develop his [[Gomu Gomu no Mi/Gear 2 Techniques|Gear 2]] and [[Gomu Gomu no Mi/Gear 3 Techniques|Gear 3]] techniques. Luffy also understood just how dangerous Lucci is, as he admitted that he could not leave their fight to try and save his friends because if he took his eyes off the CP9 agent he would simply kill everyone, which earned Luffy his praise. Like with most of his enemies, Luffy gave a nickname to Lucci, calling him the "Pigeon Guy."

Two years later Luffy would encounter Lucci again at [[Egghead]] Island, and immediately recognized him.{{Qref|chap=1068|page=17|ep=1099|Luffy encounters Lucci again.}} Despite being aware that Luffy is now one of the Four Emperors, Lucci disobeyed the World Government's direct order and engaged Luffy just for his revenge on Luffy after defeating him 2 years during the Enies Lobby Incident, while stubbornly refusing to acknowledge Luffy as an Emperor. Luffy clashed with Lucci in their awakening form but only shown Luffy is far stronger than Lucci as he easily defeated the CP agent again. When attacked by the Seraphims, Luffy decided to free Lucci to help him to stop someone who is controlling the Seraphims but under one condition, Lucci will not attack his crew which he indirectly agreed due to him wanting to kill Luffy first for humiliating him at Enies Lobby two years ago.

====Blueno====
[[Blueno]] was the first agent of CP9 that Luffy defeated. The two hardly exchanged words and only interacted twice, briefly in [[Water 7]] and again at [[Enies Lobby]]. Luffy tried to attack him in Water 7 but his attacks were completely ineffective due to Blueno's [[Rokushiki/Tekkai|Tekkai]] and [[Rokushiki/Soru|Soru]] techniques that are part of the [[Rokushiki]] martial arts style. Blueno was responsible for Luffy being able to master the Soru technique as he was able to observe his movements during their first fight.

He believed Luffy to be a weak pirate and was thus left surprised when, fighting him a second time at Enies Lobby, the [[Straw Hat Pirates|Straw Hat]] captain displayed his [[Gomu Gomu no Mi/Gear 2 Techniques|Gear 2]] form and had mastered the Soru technique in such an absurd amount of time, even after only witnessing the move. He was completely overwhelmed by Luffy and was not able cope with Luffy's onslaught. He remained defiant however, and chose to take Luffy's Jet Bazooka head on with his strongest Tekkai, this proved to be too much for him as, after a delayed reaction, he fell to the ground, defeated. After his defeat to Luffy he was made a fugitive, alongside the rest of CP9, for failing in his mission.

Luffy greatly disliked Blueno for taking away his crew mate, Robin, framing the Straw Hats for [[Iceburg]]'s attempted assassination, destroying [[Galley-La Headquarters]] and betraying the friends he had made in Water 7. Luffy still respected him as an opponent, however, and acknowledged he had to use his newly developed Gear 2 form to defeat him, and was prepared to use his [[Gomu Gomu no Mi/Gear 3 Techniques|Gear 3]] form on him when he believed his second was not enough.

====Spandam====
[[File:Spandam_Shocked_By_Luffy.png|thumb|left|250px|Spandam overwhelmed by Luffy's insanity to declare war on the World Government.]]

[[Spandam]] is the former chief of CP9, a member of CP0, and an antagonist during the [[Water 7 Arc]] and [[Enies Lobby Arc]]. They share a completely hostile relationship and do not get on well. Due to his role as a government agent, Spandam loathes Luffy and sees his defiance towards the World Government as pure insanity. He also grossly underestimated Luffy and regularly taunted Nico Robin that he would inevitably fail to save her. Luffy, in turn, hates Spandam for trying to take Robin away from him and his crew and openly challenged the chief of CP9.

He played a behind-the-scene role during the Water 7 Arc after being informed by [[Admiral]] [[Kuzan|Aokiji]] that Robin is present on Water 7. He would not directly meet Luffy until the Enies Lobby Arc after Luffy, along with his [[Straw Hat Pirates|crew]], stormed [[Enies Lobby]]. After a confrontation, he attempted to take Robin towards the [[Gates of Justice]] but was eventually stopped by [[Franky]]. At the same time, Luffy and the Straw Hats had defeated Rob Lucci and the entirety of CP9. Despite his complete, and disastrous, failure he was made a member of CP0.

Spandam found Luffy to be completely insane and was often left stunned by his open defiance towards him and the World Government. This was highlighted when he pointed out the flag of the World Government and informed Luffy about the great meaning behind it, only for the Straw Hat captain to burn it down and declare war on them, leaving him speechless. He seriously underestimated Luffy's abilities and did not concern himself when he stormed the base of Enies Lobby, but panicked when, after falsely believing he had only taken down five of his men, he was correctly informed that Luffy had taken down over a thousand [[Marines]]. When he saw that [[Blueno]] had been defeated by Luffy he was left stunned and could not believe a CP9 agent fell to a [[pirate]]. Whilst dragging Robin to the Gates of Justice he still underestimated Luffy and would gloat to her that Luffy was probably dead; this led to him going into a blind panic once he could hear Luffy closing in on him, Robin and Lucci, as the Straw Hat captain shouted Robin's name.

Luffy completely despises Spandam for his role in abducting Robin from his crew and for ultimately trying to kill her. He finds him to be both insufferable and uninteresting, as he picked his nose whilst disregarding the chief of CP9. He had no fear at all of Spandam and his role in the World Government and openly defied him numerous times. He ordered [[Usopp/Personality and Relationships#Sogeking|Sogeking]] to shoot down the flag of the World Government that Spandam proudly pointed to and challenged him head on when he questioned him if he really believed he could take on the entirety of the world.

==Marine Headquarters==
[[File:Luffy Faces Three Admirals.png|thumb|250px|Luffy facing the Marines' powerhouses, the Admirals.]]

As a pirate, Luffy is naturally an enemy of the [[Marines]]. They started to take him more seriously after he defeated the villainous [[Captain (Marine Rank)|Marine Captain]] "Axe-Hand" [[Morgan]] and several known pirates such as [[Buggy]] the Clown, "Pirate Admiral" [[Krieg|Don Krieg]], and "Saw-Tooth" [[Arlong]] the [[Fish-Men|fish-man]]. A {{B}}30,000,000 [[Bounties|bounty]] was placed on his head after he had beaten Arlong.{{Qref|chap=96|page=6|ep=45|Luffy's first bounty is put by Brannew in the wanted list.}} This reward eventually becomes {{B}}100,000,000 after he defeated [[Crocodile]], one of the [[Seven Warlords of the Sea|Seven Warlords]].{{Qref|chap=213|page=22|ep=128|Luffy's and Zoro's bounties after Arabasta.}} Luffy's bounty later increased to {{B}}300,000,000 after invading Enies Lobby,{{Qref|name=c435|chap=435|page=16-17|ep=320|The crew members' bounties for attacking Enies Lobby are revealed.}} to {{B}}400,000,000 after the Summit War of Marineford because of his heritage and actions,{{Qref|chap=601|page=11|ep=521|Luffy's fourth bounty.}} to {{B}}500,000,000 after defeating Doflamingo,{{qref|name=c801|chap=801|page=15-17|ep=746|The Straw Hat Pirates are given new bounties after [[Dressrosa Arc|Dressrosa]].}} and to {{B}}1,500,000,000 after the events of the [[Whole Cake Island Arc]].{{Qref|chap=903|page=17-18|ep=879|Luffy's sixth bounty.}} Most recently, after the [[Raid on Onigashima]], they increased his bounty to {{B}}3,000,000,000 and recognized him as one of the [[Four Emperors]].{{Qref|chap=1053|ep=|Luffy's new bounty and status as one of the Four Emperors.}}

===Fleet Admirals===
====Sakazuki====
[[File:Ace Saves Luffy.png|thumb|left|250px|Akainu kills Ace in front of Luffy.]]

[[Sakazuki]], otherwise known as Akainu, is the [[Marine Ranks#Fleet Admiral|Fleet Admiral]] of the [[Marines]] having previously been an [[Admiral]], as well as one of Luffy's sworn archenemies besides [[Marshall D. Teach]]. He and Luffy hold nothing but absolute hatred for each other and see one another as completely irredeemable enemies. Akainu loathes Luffy due to his absolute contempt for [[pirates]] and believes the Straw Hat captain is one of the biggest troublemakers out there. His hate is further fueled due to Luffy's father being the [[Revolutionary Army|Revolutionary]] [[Monkey D. Dragon]], the world's most wanted criminal. In return, Luffy has undeniable hate for Akainu as he is the one who killed his sworn brother, [[Portgas D. Ace]] right before his very eyes.

The two have only met once, during the [[Summit War of Marineford]], and for the majority of the battle they rarely crossed paths. It was only towards the climax of the conflict that Akainu truly made his presence known to Luffy when he antagonized and then murdered Ace. Because of this event, Luffy was sent into shock from the death of his brother and was rendered unconscious for the remainder of the battle. From then on, Akainu ruthlessly pursued Luffy until he was eventually stopped by the arrival of the [[Four Emperors|emperor]], [[Shanks]]. He has since cursed that day for allowing Luffy to escape and continues to hunt for the Straw Hat captain.

Akainu believes Luffy to be the foremost biggest threat to the world because he is the son of Dragon and often refers to him as "Dragon's son." He witnessed Luffy's arrival to the Summit War of Marineford and stated that Luffy is the pirate that must be taken care of the most. He has an extreme obsession to end Luffy's life simply because of his lineage to Dragon and has stopped at nothing to achieve this goal. He fought through the [[Whitebeard Pirates]] and Luffy's allies just to try and kill him, and even ignored Blackbeard's attack on Marineford and kept his focus on Luffy. He was only stopped when [[Koby]] momentarily brought the battlefield to a halt and the emperor, Shanks, had arrived, which allowed Luffy to escape.

He has been frustrated by Luffy's actions since he made his return following the time skip, as he was shocked and left angry when he was informed that Luffy had defeated the [[Seven Warlords of the Sea|Warlord]], Doflamingo and ranted at Admiral [[Issho|Fujitora]] to arrest him. Despite his complete hatred for Luffy, he was willing to acknowledge his tenacity when the Straw Hat captain managed to be the first to clear the wall and land into the plaza during the Summit War of Marineford. Akainu is one of only two characters (the other being [[Bartholomew Kuma]]) to have completely broken Luffy's indomitable spirit, a staple of Luffy's character.{{Qref|chap=589|page=19|ep=504|Luffy states he is too weak to become the Pirate King.}} He also left a great scar on his chest when he managed to land a hit on him whilst [[Jinbe]] carried an unconscious Luffy.

Luffy completely hates Akainu despite having never even exchanged words with him, nor acknowledged him, up until he killed his brother, Ace. Luffy fell unconscious from the shock and became a broken person following the battle because of what Akainu did, but was soon saved by Jinbe's words. He has never talked about Akainu but it is a safe bet to assume that there is no one else he hates more in the world than him and Blackbeard. When he was informed by Jinbe, whilst on [[Fish-Man Island]], that Akainu had become the new Fleet Admiral following [[Sengoku]]'s resignation and after defeating his rival, [[Kuzan|Aokiji]] for the position, he was shown to have an angry expression on his face and placed his hand on the scar that he got from him.{{Qref|name=Scar|chap=650|page=6|ep=570}}

Sakazuki sent Fujitora to Dressrosa in order to deal with Luffy. After the Totto-Land incident, Sakazuki shown his rage on Luffy's new bountry and regarding his mistake for not being able to kill Luffy at the Summit War. When Luffy became a new member of the Four Emperors, Akainu's rage towards Luffy's fame is gotten even worse. Hearing Luffy is on Egghead, Akainu comment that if Luffy wants to declare war, he would've consult with the Fleet Admiral first. Akainu dispatched Kizaru into dealing with Luffy.

===Admirals===
====Borsalino====
[[File:Borsalino_Kicks_Luffy.png|thumb|250px|Kizaru attacks Luffy.]]

[[Borsalino]], otherwise known as Kizaru, is an [[Admiral]] of the [[Marines]]. He first meets Luffy and his [[Straw Hat Pirates|crew]] during the [[Sabaody Archipelago Arc]] after Luffy assaulted Charlos and he was sent to [[Sabaody Archipelago|Sabaody]] to arrest or eliminate the Straw Hat captain, but found his attempts frustrated by the intervention of [[Silvers Rayleigh]] and [[Bartholomew Kuma]]. The two met again during the Summit War of Marineford where he interfered with Luffy's attempts to save [[Portgas D. Ace|Ace]] multiple times and tried to prevent his escape from [[Marineford]] before being stopped by [[Benn Beckman]].

Before the timeskip, Kizaru did not particularly care too much about Luffy at the time due to his apathetic nature, but he did recognize how much of a troublemaker and dangerous person he was. However, he still looked down at Luffy and believed him to be a weak [[pirate]], as shown when he faced the Straw Hat captain during the Summit War of Marineford, and ridiculed him and insulted [[Edward Newgate|Whitebeard]] for allowing someone so weak to lead his attack. Nonetheless, he has commented that Luffy is scary after he was the first person to clear the wall and land in the plaza of Marineford and was also surprised when Luffy unleashed his [[Haki/Haoshoku Haki|Haoshoku Haki]]. It was because of this use of [[Haki]] that he, along with his fellow Admirals, pursued Luffy to try and kill him as he believed it was a sign of the dangerous person he will become. Due to his exceptionally laid back attitude, Kizaru is ultimately not fazed by some of the actions Luffy commits and is not too upset after he managed to escape his grasp, twice.

Luffy, at first, considered Kizaru an incredibly powerful enemy and generally tried to avoid fighting him. Luffy saw this strength when he and his crew confronted the Admiral at Sabaody, and attempted for him and his crew to retreat. He was also thankful when Rayleigh intervened on their behalf due to this fact. Throughout the Summit War of Marineford, he was greatly frustrated by Kizaru's constant interventions in his attempt to save Ace, having been defeated by him twice during the conflict. He also panicked when, after managing to reach Ace, the key to his [[seastone]] handcuffs was destroyed by Kizaru. However, he did not appear to take any personal offense to the ridicule he got from the Admiral and simply chose to carry on trying to rescue Ace.

Following the death of his brother, the marine Admiral pursued the comatose Luffy when he was about to be rescued by [[Trafalgar D. Water Law]] but the [[Red Hair Pirates]] arrived and [[Benn Beckman]] intervened on behalf of Luffy.

When hearing Luffy was on [[Egghead]], Kizaru was deployed to deal with Luffy again and aid Rob Lucci. The two clash when the Straw Hats and Vegapunk attempt to flee the island and this time, Luffy was confident he could fight him on equal footing thanks to his two years of training and the previous battles he had been through, even stating that he isn't the same person on Sabaody to Kizaru. This proved true as Kizaru started to struggle against him, acknowledging that he earned his title of Emperor after defeating [[Kaidou]]. Eventually Luffy managed to incapacitate Kizaru using [[Gomu Gomu no Mi/Gear 5 Techniques|Gear 5]], dealing damage even Kizaru took seriously to himself. After Luffy recovered his stamina he foiled Kizaru's attempt to kill Bonney, with another powerful strike to the Admiral. Kizaru was now dismayed at the situation stating that he would be in trouble as he would be expected to take Luffy (and Sanji's) heads. When Kizaru kicked Sanji away and stabbed through Vegapunk, Luffy then used Gear 5 giant form to restrain him from doing any more harm, causing him to cough up blood.{{Qref|name=c1108|chap=1108|page=9-13|ep=}} In this state Luffy overpowered Kizaru, flattening both him and Saturn with [[Gomu Gomu no Mi/Gear 5 Techniques#Gomu Gomu no Dawn Cymbal|Dawn Cymbal]] and flung the Admiral into a Marine ship.

====Issho====
[[File:Luffy Faces Issho.png|thumb|left|250px|Luffy faces Fujitora as he tries to reach Doflamingo.]]

[[Issho]], otherwise known as Fujitora, is an [[admiral]] of the [[Marines]] and a supporting ally, as well as an antagonist, to Luffy and his [[Straw Hat Pirates|crew]] during the [[Dressrosa Arc]]. Compared to most members of the Marines, Luffy and Fujitora arguably have the most positive relationship. Fujitora, like many others, has become intrigued with Luffy's character and was willing to offer up his aid to him in his fight against [[Donquixote Doflamingo]]. Luffy has a lot of respect for Fujitora but also feels pity for him due to his blindness whilst still acknowledging his immense power.

The two first met on [[Dressrosa]], inside a casino, where Fujitora was gambling. Whilst being taken advantage of by members of the [[Donquixote Pirates]], due to his blindness, Luffy stepped in and clarified that he had actually won his bet. The two crossed paths again during Luffy's attempt to reach Doflamingo but were soon interrupted by [[Pica]]. Although Fujitora attempted to frustrate Luffy's efforts against Doflamingo, he had also become wary of the Seven Warlords and decided to aid the Straw Hats after he had become somewhat disillusioned with the Marines' role in Dressrosa. He stated to [[Riku Doldo III|King Riku]] that he wished to take a gamble on Luffy to save the kingdom. By the end of the arc, he eventually tried to apprehend Luffy and his crew and, after briefly fighting him, decided to let him escape once he realized that the citizens were trying to help him, causing him to ponder what kind of person Luffy truly is.

Fujitora very much has a complex view on Luffy, owing to Luffy's complex nature. He views the Straw Hat captain as his enemy for being a [[pirate]], but is conflicted by his kind heartiness and how his own sense of justice clashed with the Marines’ sense of justice. This results in him changing sides, from protecting Doflamingo, a Warlord, to supporting Luffy and his crew to save Dressrosa. He was troubled about having to arrest Luffy and instead decided to use his dices to make the decision for him, commenting that Luffy is a lucky person as his dices landed favorably for him two days in a row. During his brief fight with Luffy, he showed complete amusement at Luffy unusually calling out the direction of his own attacks because of his blindness, finding it absurd but also annoying as he was being pitied by him.

Following his fight against Luffy, he noticed that there was not a hint of anger in any of the voices of the citizens who were "chasing" Luffy out of their kingdom; instead, they seemed to adore him. Having blinded himself because he wished to no longer see the atrocities of the world, he admitted, for the first time in his life, that he now regrets his blindness because he cannot see Luffy's face. This caused Fujitora to ponder what Luffy looks like and wanted to believe he has a kind face. He ultimately decided to drop the debris he had lifted into the sky on top of Doflamingo's business associates who were trying to kill the Straw Hat captain, instead of Luffy and his crew, as a way to thank him.

Luffy was not aware that Fujitora is an Admiral when he first met him and decided to help him when he was being cheated out of a game of dice by members of the Donquixote Pirates. Despite having learned he is an enemy, Luffy still pities him for being blind which led to him announcing every one of his attacks whilst fighting the Admiral, however, this prompted laughter from Fujitora which irritated Luffy. However, even though he patronized him, he still views Fujitora as a person that he and his crew must surpass as he declared that he should no longer run away from powerful foes like him, wanting to prove that his training was not for nothing. He was frustrated when [[Hajrudin]] forcibly took him away from his fight against Fujitora.

===Vice-Admirals===
====Smoker====
[[File:Smoker Subdues Luffy at Marineford.png|thumb|250px|A typical encounter between Luffy and Smoker.]]

[[Smoker]] is a [[Vice Admiral|Vice-Admiral]] of the [[Marines]] and the Commander of [[G-5]]. He is Luffy's most prominent antagonist within the Marines, having hunted down the Straw Hat captain since the [[Loguetown Arc]]. They share a complex relationship as both enemies and allies due to their differing personalities but affinity for honor. Smoker believes Luffy is a troublesome [[pirate]] that he must capture but also understands that he is not a bad person. Luffy does recognize Smoker as an enemy but nonetheless likes to treat him as a friend since he believes him to be a good guy.

Whilst stationed in [[Loguetown]], Smoker heard about the chaos being caused by pirates in the plaza and headed there to capture them. Having witnessed [[Buggy]]'s failed execution of Luffy, he tried to apprehend the Straw Hat captain but was stopped by [[Monkey D. Dragon]] who, unbeknownst to him at the time, is Luffy's father. He followed Luffy all the way to [[Arabasta Kingdom|Arabasta]] where he ended up getting captured alongside him and his [[Straw Hat Pirates|crew]] by Crocodile. Because Luffy saved his life he allowed him to escape and temporarily left Arabasta due to urgent business. He next encountered Luffy during the [[Summit War of Marineford]] and at one point managed to capture him but was kicked away by [[Boa Hancock]] whilst Luffy escaped his grasp yet again. On [[Punk Hazard]], he came across Luffy once more and attempted to apprehend him but did not have the fighting strength to do so after he was put into [[Tashigi]]’s body due to [[Trafalgar D. Water Law|Trafalgar Law]]'s [[Ope Ope no Mi|Devil Fruit]]. He ended up working with Luffy and the Straw Hats to take down [[Caesar Clown]] and once more allowed Luffy to escape as a way to repay his work in defeating Caesar.

Smoker is both greatly intrigued by Luffy as a person but also dislikes him because he is a pirate. Due to witnessing [[Gol D. Roger]]'s execution, Luffy almost being executed by Buggy on top of Roger's execution platform had a profound impact on Smoker as he was left stunned by Luffy's willingness to embrace his death with a smile, exactly like Roger, and was even more stunned that it occurred on the anniversary of Roger's execution. This piqued his interest in the Straw Hat captain and has resulted in him obsessively following Luffy to the [[Grand Line]] and the [[New World]], having requested a transfer to the notorious G-5 unit for this specific purpose. When Dragon prevented him from capturing Luffy in Loguetown, he was completely perplexed why the most wanted man in the world would save a relatively unknown pirate at the time. Eventually, he was informed that Dragon is Luffy's father and understood why he intervened. Whilst he was in Arabasta, he came across [[Portgas D. Ace]] and was intent on capturing the [[Whitebeard Pirates]]' Second Division Commander, however, after he saw Luffy he completely disregarded Ace and devoted his time and effort to capturing the Straw Hat captain instead, despite Ace being a much more notorious and dangerous pirate than Luffy at the time. He was confused to see Luffy working alongside Crocodile when the pair arrived, with their makeshift crew, at the Summit War of Marineford. Smoker finally understood why Dragon saved Luffy and he became determined to stop him from progressing into a future threat. He pursued Luffy during the conflict and momentarily caught him once more but was stopped by an enraged Hancock.

Despite his dislike towards Luffy, Smoker harbors no serious hatred towards Luffy and does not seem intent on killing him but instead simply wants to capture him. He is more than willing to work with Luffy if the situation calls for it, such as on Arabasta and Punk Hazard. He accepts that he owes Luffy and his crew a great deal, especially following the [[Arabasta Arc]], as the Straw Hats had covered for the Marines' mistake of failing to stop Crocodile's plans coming to fruition. He was absolutely livid when the [[World Government]] intended to give him credit for Crocodile's defeat and wanted the world to know it was Luffy and his crew that saved the kingdom. It was also during this arc that he reluctantly allowed Luffy and his crew to escape after Luffy had ordered his crew mate, [[Roronoa Zoro]], to save his life as he could not swim due to being a [[Moku Moku no Mi|Devil Fruit]] user. During the Summit War of Marineford, he complimented Luffy that he had gotten stronger as he pinned him down with his jitte. He also decided to work with Luffy, his crew, and Trafalgar Law on Punk Hazard once it was revealed that [[Vergo]] had betrayed the Marines. Having succeeded in their mission, he reluctantly took part in a banquet that Luffy and his crew held and once more allowed him to escape his grasp. Due to having pursued Luffy for so long, he has picked up on his habits and was able to correctly predict that he would try and visit [[Raijin Island]] as it was extremely dangerous and is fully aware of Luffy's reckless nature.

[[File:Smoker Let's Luffy Run Away.png|thumb|left|250px|Smoker lets Luffy escape after he rescued him.]]

Luffy found Smoker to be one of the toughest people he had faced when he met him in Loguetown, as he was the first [[Logia]] [[Devil Fruit]] user he had fought. This has led Luffy to, unusually, runaway from Smoker rather than fight him. However, despite him being his enemy, Luffy is pretty kind to Smoker and does not believe him to be a bad person despite his constant pursuit of him. Such is his fondness for Smoker, he ordered his crew mate, Zoro, to save Smoker's life as they fell into water during their escape from Crocodile's casino and was very happy to see him again when he arrived in the New World on Punk Hazard, admitting he worried about him following the Summit War of Marineford. He is very warm and friendly with Smoker even though they are enemies and often jokes with him despite his stoic nature. Following the time skip, Luffy was more than eager to fight Smoker on Punk Hazard, having now mastered all three types of [[Haki]], but chose not to when he discovered that Smoker and Tashigi had their bodies swapped by Law. Luffy has the habit to refer to Smoker as "Smokey."

===Captains===
====Koby====
[[File:Luffy And Koby Reunited.png|thumb|250px|Luffy and Koby talking at Water 7.]]

[[Koby]] is a [[Captain (Marine Rank)|Captain]] of the [[Marine]]s, a former [[pirate]], and the first friend Luffy made at sea. The two first met during the [[Romance Dawn Arc]] and became good friends rather quickly. They both share a close relationship and often wonder how each other are doing from time to time. Koby has huge admiration for Luffy and credits him with giving him the inspiration to try and fulfill his dream of becoming a strong Marine. Luffy found Koby's cowardly nature to be pathetic but viewed him as a friend regardless. He was very happy to see that Koby is trying to become a Marine and had grown a lot since he met him.

The two met at the beginning of Luffy's journey to become the [[Pirate#Pirate King|Pirate King]] after he ended up in [[Alvida]]'s camp. Luffy broke out of his barrel and met Koby who he quickly befriended. He managed to defeat Alvida and thus liberated Koby from serving under her. The two travelled together to reach [[Shells Town]] so Luffy could recruit the notorious [[Bounty Hunter|bounty hunter]], [[Roronoa Zoro]]. After rescuing Zoro, Koby and Luffy agreed to part ways. The two met again on [[Water 7]], with Koby now being under the apprenticeship of Luffy's grandfather, [[Monkey D. Garp]], and after a brief fight and a friendly chat they parted ways once again. Koby was present during the [[Summit War of Marineford]] but only came across Luffy very briefly when he tried to stop him reaching [[Portgas D. Ace|Ace]], but was immediately defeated. The two have not met since but Koby passionately keeps up to date with his friend's exploits.

Despite being on opposite sides, the pair share an indomitable friendship. They take great pride in each other's accomplishments and hold no prejudice or ill will for each other despite being enemies. They also completely accept that they will inevitably clash in the future and do not hold grudges when they do so, such as at the Summit War of Marineford, as they both fully understand each other's obligations. The two like to talk about each other, but whilst Luffy openly discusses their friendship, Koby prefers to keep it hidden due to the strict nature of the Marines. When they reunited on Water 7, they both marveled at how much strong the other has gotten, Luffy was especially amazed over Koby's drastic growth spurt.

Out of everyone he has met, Koby admires Luffy the most and cherishes his friendship with him as he was the first person who ever acknowledged him as a friend. When they first met, he was amazed by Luffy's fierce determination to become the Pirate King and even divulged his own dreams of becoming a strong Marine to him. After seeing Luffy's fearlessness, he was able to momentarily throw away his cowardly nature and insult Alvida instead of fearfully praising her. His admiration for Luffy led to him aiding Luffy in his quest to free Zoro, especially after he found his resolve to uphold "real justice" as a Marine. This admiration convinced Koby to officially join the Marines and to work hard to achieve his ultimate goal of becoming an [[admiral]]. Because of the great respect he has for Luffy, he is determined to defeat and capture him one day as, to him, Luffy is the person he must measure himself up against in order to become a strong Marine. This has resulted in him trying to fight Luffy a few times but always being easily defeated, such as on Water 7 and again at the Summit War of Marineford. Following the time skip, Koby met [[Rebecca]], a fellow admirer of Luffy, and found out about his recent exploits in [[Totto Land]], crying tears of joy at his achievements.

[[File:Luffy Punches Koby At Marineford.png|thumb|left|250px|Luffy punches Koby at the Summit War of Marineford.]]

Koby is often stunned by Luffy's fearless and straightforward attitude. He was crushed when Luffy bluntly told him he does not like him because he is a coward and was left stunned when he casually insulted Alvida. When Luffy revealed his intention to recruit the Pirate Hunter, Zoro, he was shocked and desperately tried to discourage his new friend from attempting this. He panicked when Luffy punched the son of [[Morgan|Captain Morgan]], [[Helmeppo]], and tried to hold him back. He watched in amazement as Luffy was able to overwhelm Captain Morgan during their fight in Shells Town. He was initially upset with Luffy, and punched him, after he revealed his past as a pirate to the local Marines. After being beaten up by Luffy he realized that Luffy was actually putting distance between them so he could become a Marine, as being associated with a pirate is extremely taboo. He thus gave his friend a Marine salute as he sailed out of Shells Town and thanked him for what he had done for him. When he travelled with Garp to Water 7, he was left completely shocked when his commander revealed that, not only is he Luffy's grandfather, but that the leader of the [[Revolutionary Army]], [[Monkey D. Dragon]], is Luffy's father. During the Summit War of Marineford, he could not believe that Luffy not only fell out of the sky on to the battlefield but that he had also managed to escape from the infamous prison, [[Impel Down]].

Like Koby, Luffy cherishes the friendship they share and has a lot of faith in Koby to grow and become stronger. When Luffy first met Koby he insulted him for his cowardly nature but still befriended him anyway. He was proud of him when he stood up to Alvida and saved him when she went to strike him with her mace. He decided to travel with him for a short while and relied on him as a [[navigator]] to get to Shells Town as he wished to recruit Zoro. Luffy does not pay much attention to Koby's objections towards his actions, often completely disregarding them, nonetheless, he is happy to have him by his side despite how weak he is. He is also more than willing to attack Koby if the situation calls for it, as he knocked out his old friend with a single punch during the Summit War of Marineford when he stood in his way. Nonetheless, he considers Koby to be a very good friend and was very happy to meet him again in Water 7 where he reminisced with him and Helmeppo.

He wants Koby to follow his dreams and was happy to motivate him to do so. When he found out that his dream is to become a Marine, but his past as a pirate would hinder his chances, he decided to help Koby by antagonizing and attacking him when the Marines came to remove him and Zoro from Shells Town in order to put distance between him and Koby so he could join the Marines. Luffy was overjoyed to see he had started to work to achieve his dream of becoming a strong Marine and was impressed by the improvements he had made. When Koby bluntly told him he wishes to become an Admiral and to defeat and capture him one day he was not at all bothered by this, instead being overjoyed to see how far Koby has come and gave him words of encouragement to meet him in the [[New World]].

====Morgan====
[[File:Luffy Fights Morgan.png|thumb|250px|Luffy defeating Morgan.]]

[[Morgan]] is a former [[Marine]] captain and a wanted criminal. He was an antagonist to Luffy during the [[Romance Dawn Arc]] whilst in [[Shells Town]]. Luffy does not like Morgan and sees him as a cruel and abusive person. Like most Marines, Morgan dislikes Luffy because he is a [[pirate]], but also because he damaged his ego and ended his luxurious lifestyle of being a Marine captain.

Luffy arrived in Shells Town and noticed that the residents of the town cowered at the name of Morgan. He later met Morgan's son, [[Helmeppo]], in a restaurant and overheard him bragging about his intentions not to honor his deal with [[Roronoa Zoro|Zoro]] and punched him. Luffy later stormed the Marine base for Zoro's swords and angered Morgan in the process. He then fought him in the base's courtyard and comfortably took him down, alongside his son, with the aid of Zoro.

Due to being extremely prideful, egotistical and cruel, Morgan absolutely despised Luffy, not just for being a pirate but for openly defying him. He grew extremely angry when Luffy accidentally destroyed the statue he had built of himself and wished to kill him. He was somewhat shaken at seeing Luffy's [[Gomu Gomu no Mi|Devil Fruit]] powers, as this was his first time seeing one. Nonetheless, he still maintained his determination to take down Luffy but was easily bested by the pirate. When his son distracted Luffy by threatening [[Koby]], he tried to land a sneak attack but was stopped by Zoro.

Luffy did not like Morgan and recognized him as a cruel personal based on the reactions the townsfolk had just from mentioning his name, and again when he defeated him. Despite his notorious reputation among the Marines in [[East Blue]], he was not at all worried about facing him, and took him on with a big smile as he knew how much stronger he was than the captain. Nonetheless, when he had subdued Morgan, he showed his hatred for the captain, as he punched Morgan whilst chastising him for ruining Koby's idealistic views of the Marines.

====Tashigi====
[[File:Luffy Asks Tashigi's Help.png|thumb|left|250px|Tashigi reluctantly helps Luffy chase down Crocodile.]]

[[Tashigi]] is a captain in the [[Marine]]s who serves under [[Vice Admiral|Vice-Admiral]] [[Smoker]] and has joined him as part of the [[G-5]] squad. The two have rarely interacted, however, they have crossed paths and see each other as enemies. Tashigi, like her superior, Smoker, views Luffy as an enemy because he is a [[pirate]], but has also begrudgingly come to respect him for his good deeds. Luffy does not have particular opinion of Tashigi but acknowledges her as a good person because she works alongside Smoker.

Alongside Smoker, Tashigi watched as Luffy survived his execution from [[Buggy]] whilst in [[Loguetown]] and tried to chase after him and his crew, particularly [[Roronoa Zoro|Zoro]], but lost her fight to the swordsman and allowed Luffy and his [[Straw Hat Pirates|crew]] to escape. She met Luffy and his crew again in [[Arabasta Kingdom|Arabasta]] with the intent of apprehending them but ended up providing aid to Luffy when he was hunting down [[Crocodile]]. She was present at the [[Summit War of Marineford]] and notified Smoker of Luffy's arrival, being just as surprised as he was that Crocodile was with him. She would not encounter Luffy again until after the time skip on [[Punk Hazard]] where she, after attempting to fight Luffy whilst in Smoker's body, ends up working alongside him to defeat [[Caesar Clown]] and his subordinates.

Due to Luffy being a pirate, she wishes to apprehend him and follows Smoker faithfully in order to achieve this. She feels both a sense of gratefulness, but also frustration, at having to rely on Luffy and his crew for help. This was most apparent in Arabasta when, after being defeated by [[Nico Robin]] and ridiculed by Crocodile, she could do nothing but point Luffy in the direction that Crocodile went in. This greatly upset her and damaged her pride, as she scolded herself for being weak and having to rely on a pirate such as Luffy for help. However, during the [[Punk Hazard Arc]] she was a little more accepting of working alongside Luffy and his crew to take down Caesar Clown. Her respect for him has slightly improved as she chastised the troops of G-5 for denying the children's wish to thank Luffy and his crew for what they did.

Luffy never acknowledges Tashigi and has only interacted with her on two occasions, once in Arabasta and again in Punk Hazard. However, he gives her the benefit of the doubt due to her working alongside Smoker and tends to be friendly around her as oppose to hostile despite her being a Marine. He thanked her back in Arabasta when she gave him the direction that Crocodile went in. Luffy openly thinks she is weak as when he fought against her whilst she was in Smoker's body he was disappointed at how much weaker "Smoker" had apparently gotten, and when he fought Smoker whilst he was in Tashigi's body he commented that she had gotten strong. He also does not remember her name and tends to just refer to her as "the girl with glasses."

===Other Officers===
====Helmeppo====
[[File:Luffy Punches Helmeppo.png|thumb|250px|Luffy punches Helmeppo when they first meet.]]

[[Helmeppo]] is an officer in the [[Marines]] and a minor antagonist to Luffy during the [[Romance Dawn Arc]]. They originally shared a hostile relationship but have come to see each other as friends since Helmeppo joined the Marines alongside [[Koby]]. Helmeppo is often amazed by Luffy's abilities and considers him to be a great person, similar to Koby. Luffy has come to see him as a friend, but has struggled to remember who he is, nonetheless, he is kind to Helmeppo despite having originally hated him.

Whilst in [[Shells Town]], Luffy intended to recruit [[Roronoa Zoro]] into his crew but he was tied up to a post in a Marine base on the orders of Helmeppo, who is the son of the now disgraced [[Captain (Marine Rank)|Captain]] [[Morgan]]. Eventually, Luffy worked with Koby to free Zoro and easily defeated Morgan and Helmeppo. Luffy would not meet Helmeppo again until the [[Post-Enies Lobby Arc]] where he was amazed to see he was now part of the Marines, alongside Koby, and has cleaned up his attitude. Helmeppo was also present at the [[Summit War of Marineford]] but the two did not cross paths.

Originally, Helmeppo was incredibly antagonistic towards Luffy due to his self-entitlement for being the son of a famous Marine captain, however, he is also a complete coward and greatly feared Luffy as he was not only strong, but more than prepared to hit him. This results in him despising Luffy and tried to get his father to kill him but ended up getting hit by him. Following his father's defeat, and the loss of his luxurious lifestyle, he hated Luffy and at one point stabbed a doll resembling the Straw Hat captain. However, by the time of the Post-Enies Lobby Arc, and after being trained under Luffy's grandfather, [[Monkey D. Garp]], he had a redeemed personality and was very friendly to Luffy but was disappointed that he only remembered him as a spoiled rich kid. Nonetheless, he sat with Luffy and Koby as the three reminisced about how they met. Like many others, he is shocked by Luffy's actions and lineage, when he discovered that his father is [[Monkey D. Dragon]], and his grandfather is his own commander, Monkey D. Garp, he was stunned. His jaw dropped at the sight of seeing Luffy arrive to the Summit War of Marineford, and at the realization that he had escaped [[Impel Down]].

Luffy initially loathed Helmeppo, as he was furious when he overheard him bragging about not honoring the deal he made with Zoro, and proceeded to punch him. During his battle with Morgan, he punched Helmeppo for pointing a gun at Koby, leaving him defeated. He never thought much about Helmeppo after the incident in Shells Town and had mostly forgotten him by the time he met him again in [[Water 7]]. However, after remembering who he was, and seeing how much better he is, he treated him as a friend and is happy to see he is friends with Koby, who Luffy considered a close friend. He sat with both Helmeppo and Koby to reminisce about how they all met, gleefully informing Helmeppo about how Koby accidentally became a [[pirate]], laughing at Koby's expense.

====Hina====
[[File:Hina Confronts Luffy.png|thumb|left|250px|Hina tries to capture Luffy at the Summit War of Marineford.]]

[[Hina]] is an officer in the [[Marines]] and is a minor antagonist to Luffy and his [[Straw Hat Pirates|crew]] at the end of the [[Arabasta Arc]] and the [[Marineford Arc]]. Hina, like many in the Marines, dislikes Luffy for being a [[pirate]] and hunts him down whenever the opportunity arises. Luffy treats Hina like any other Marine officer and tries to avoid confrontation with her, as a result, he has never had a serious interaction with her.

On [[Arabasta Kingdom|Arabasta]], following Luffy's victory over [[Crocodile]], Hina arrived alongside [[Smoker]]. Hearing that Luffy and his crew were nearby, she opted to personally try and apprehend them all as they sailed away from the desert kingdom. However, whilst seeking to entrap them, she was tricked by [[Bentham|Bon Clay]] and his crew who posed as the Straw Hats, allowing the real Straw Hats to escape. She next encountered Luffy at the [[Summit War of Marineford]] and attempted to stop the Straw Hat captain but he was too quick for her and slipped away once again.

Very much like every Marine, she wishes to capture Luffy as she believes him to be a dangerous pirate and a threat to the world. At Arabasta, she broke her strategic formation when she believed she had spotted Luffy and tried to pursue him, only to have been deceived by Bon Clay. However, it is apparent she does not necessarily hate Luffy as she was indulging of Smoker's distaste for receiving credit for defeating Crocodile when it was Luffy. She also does not seem bitter about having allowed Luffy to escape and even smiled when she deduced that Smoker was pleased he managed to get away. She is also humble to Luffy, as when her attempt to ensnare him during the Summit War of Marineford, with her [[Ori Ori no Mi|Devil Fruit]] powers, failed she complimented his speed and admitted he had bested her.

Luffy first heard of Hina from Bon Clay when he had escaped with him out of Arabasta and was warned by his new friend that she is a dangerous Marine. Luffy was in tears as Bon Clay sacrificed himself to Hina in order to allow him to escape her. He eventually came face to face with Hina at the Summit War of Marineford and surprisingly remembered who she was. He was momentarily caught off guard by her Devil Fruit abilities but was ultimately able to escape from her rather easily. It appears he might have taken Bon Clay's warning about Hina seriously as he opted not to try and fight her at the Summit War of Marineford despite going on to fight nearly every other enemy he encountered during the battle.

==Overview==
Due to civilians' stereotypical view of pirates, and how Luffy is an increasingly infamous pirate, and has recently become one of the new Four Emperors, it is implied that many civilians fear and even hate him. However, Luffy managed to earn the respect, trust and friendship of those who had the opportunity to meet him in person, including even some royalty. The reason for this is because Luffy and his crew are often responsible for saving people from pirates, criminals and villains who pose great threats to their respective communities, This leads to civilians often idolizing them as their heroes and saviors. Furthermore, many civilians who aspire to be pirates admire, respect and idolize Luffy and see him as an idol, role model and inspiration.{{Confirm}}

==Foosha Village==
[[File:Foosha Villagers Celebrate Luffy's Success.png|thumb|left|220px|The people of Foosha Village celebrating Luffy's latest bounty.]]

[[Foosha Village]] is a port village on [[Dawn Island]] in the [[Goa Kingdom]] that is ruled by [[Sterry|King Sterry]]. Luffy spent half of his childhood in Foosha Village and dominantly has nothing but happy memories being there. He got on well with everybody who lived there and was well known among the citizenry for his enthusiastic, brash, but joyful, personality. The people of Foosha Village are greatly fond of Luffy, they love him dearly and have found great joy in his success as a [[pirate]].

Luffy was born in Foosha Village and was the first place he called home. He frequented [[Partys Bar]] as he was close to the barmaid, [[Makino]], who gave him free food and drinks. It was here that he would eventually meet [[Shanks]]. However, he was taken away from the village by his grandfather, [[Monkey D. Garp|Garp]], and taken to [[Curly Dadan|Dadan]] who lived in [[Mt. Colubo]] just outside the village. He sailed out of Foosha Village to begin his journey to become the [[Pirate King]], waving goodbye to everyone.

Pretty much all of the village folk in Foosha Village are friendly with Luffy and enjoyed his loud and boisterous personality. Due to not having any parents to raise him, the villagers became very tolerant of Luffy and cared for his well-being. Many of the villagers came to Luffy's aid when he was kidnapped by the [[bandit]], [[Higuma]], and tried to negotiate his safe return. When Garp returned to the village following the [[Summit War of Marineford]] a lot of them were greatly worried about Luffy's well-being and asked Garp for some information about him. They saw Luffy off when he left to become the Pirate King after he turned 17 and have since followed his journey with a passion. Asides from the Mayor, they have no issue with Luffy being a notorious criminal and in fact take great pride in it.

Luffy loves his hometown and fondly remembers the people there who helped raise him in the early parts of his childhood. He made numerous friends whilst there, particularly Makino, who acted almost like a mother and cared for him deeply, a sentiment he reciprocated. The Mayor of the village, [[Woop Slap]], who is disgruntled about Luffy's decision to be a pirate and his growing infamy, but nonetheless cares for his well-being. [[Gyoru]] and [[Chicken]], who own the fish shop in the village and would sell their fish to Luffy, they are very happy about Luffy following his dream to become a pirate. It was whilst at Foosha Village that Luffy met Shanks and the [[Red Hair Pirates]], befriending all of them. It was his encounter with Shanks and his crew that sparked his dream to become the Pirate King.

===Woop Slap===
[[File:Makino and Woop Slap at Luffy's Departure.png|thumb|220px|Woop Slap watches Luffy set sail on his journey with Makino.]]

[[Woop Slap]] is the mayor of [[Foosha Village]] and has shared a close relationship with Luffy since he was a child. He is the only person, out of his entire village, that shows great disapproval of Luffy's decision to become a [[pirate]] and has lamented his increasing notoriety. Luffy has rarely been seen interacting with Woop Slap, but cares for him as a member of Foosha Village and remembers him fondly.

Throughout his childhood, Woop Slap has been watching over Luffy and has come to care for him deeply. He did his best to negotiate with the [[bandit]], [[Higuma]], for Luffy's safe return. When Luffy was taken to live with the [[Dadan Family]] he came to visit him alongside [[Makino]].

Due to his friendship with Makino, and being the mayor of the town, he has come to know Luffy extremely well and has grown fond of him. He attempted to negotiate Luffy's safe return from the bandit, Higuma, until [[Shanks]] and his [[Red Hair Pirates|crew]] stepped in. He was extremely worried about Luffy's well-being after the [[Summit War of Marineford]] and asked [[Monkey D. Garp|Garp]] if he knew anything. Ever since Luffy became a pirate he has been upset and often vents his frustration over Luffy's actions, something he feels has brought shame on the village. However, despite his opposition, he still saw Luffy off on his journey to become the [[Pirate King]]. He is also one of the very few people who knows about Luffy's origins.

Luffy has never been seen directly interacting with Woop Slap and so his opinion of the mayor has never been expressed, however, he does not seem hostile towards him despite his objections of him becoming a pirate, and was seemingly grateful for his efforts to save him from Higuma. Just like how Luffy remembers the rest of the village fondly, it's likely he remembers Woop Slap in much the same way.

===Makino===
[[File:Luffy And Makino Smiling.png|thumb|left|220px|Luffy and Makino smiling together.]]

[[Makino]] is a bartender at [[Partys Bar]] in [[Foosha Village]], the hometown of Luffy. The two get on very well and have known each other throughout Luffy's childhood. Makino cares for Luffy a great deal and is supportive of his dream to become the [[Pirate King]], she is arguably the closest person Luffy had to a mother before [[Curly Dadan|Dadan]]. Luffy likes Makino a great deal, enjoying her company and being at her bar.

The two have known each other since Luffy was a child. They would often be in the bar together where Makino would give him free drinks and food. She alerted the mayor of Foosha Village, [[Woop Slap]], as well as the town's residents, when Luffy was taken away by the [[bandit]], [[Higuma]]. Throughout Luffy's time with Dadan she would come visit Luffy, [[Portgas D. Ace|Ace]] and [[Sabo]] to deliver new clothes to them. She saw Luffy off when he started his journey to become the Pirate King.

Luffy would visit her bar frequently where he eventually would meet [[Shanks]]. Although he has never stated what he thinks of Makino, it is apparent that he cares for her a lot and enjoyed being in her company. When he saw her again whilst living with Dadan he was overjoyed and hugged her. He is grateful for all the things she would do for him and treats Makino with a lot of respect, finding her kindness endearing.

Makino is very loving of Luffy and almost acts as a mother to him. She would regularly give him free food and drinks at her bar and jokingly say she would add it to his treasure tab. She is very supportive of Luffy's dream and is happy with whatever Luffy decides to do with his life so long as he is happy. She was devastated at the news of Ace's death and cried over the thought of what Luffy must be going through. She keeps up to date with his exploits and is seen smiling whenever his [[bounty]] goes up.

==Shells Town==
[[File:Shells Town Citizens Cower Around Luffy.png|thumb|220px|Townsfolk of Shells Town become frightened after Luffy mentions Zoro and Morgan.]]

[[Shells Town]] is the home of a [[Marine Base|Marine base]] in [[East Blue]]. The citizenry there hold Luffy in high regard for having defeated the tyrannical [[Captain (Marine Rank)|Marine captain]], [[Morgan]]. They were very hospitable towards Luffy and upset when the [[Marines]] forced Luffy to leave the town. Luffy did not initially care for the citizens there, but was happy to have saved them from Morgan and appreciated their warm hospitality.

Luffy arrived in Shells Town after defeating the [[pirate]], [[Alvida]], and befriending [[Koby]]. He explored the island to find [[Roronoa Zoro]], who he wanted to recruit, and was able to find him in the court yard of the local Marine base. Having defeated the Marine captain stationed there, he inadvertently won the admiration of the citizens and left the island leaving a positive impression on the people there.

The citizens of Shells Town generally hold the view that pirates are bad people and are pretty content with being under the direct protection of the Marines there. However, due to Luffy having no actual notoriety or [[bounty]], they were blissfully unaware that he was a pirate. However, they became frantic when Luffy assaulted [[Helmeppo]], who is the son of Morgan, and feared for their own safety. Following his victory over the Marine captain all of the citizens came to admire Luffy and were upset when the Marines, led by [[Ripper]], kicked them off island, protesting the decision. Some local residents, such as [[Ririka]], and her daughter, [[Rika]], became friendly with Luffy and allowed him to eat at her home.

When he arrived, Luffy noted that the mention of Morgan's name caused the townsfolk to cower in fear, with Koby adding that they seemed more fearful of the Marine captain's name than Zoro's. Ultimately, Luffy paid no mind to it and carried on looking for Zoro. After defeating Morgan, Luffy was happy to find out he had saved the town from his tyranny and was appreciative of their kindness towards him.

===Rika===
[[File:Luffy And Rika.png|thumb|left|220px|Luffy telling Rika that Zoro enjoyed the rice balls she made for him.]]

[[Rika]] is the daughter of [[Ririka]], is a waitress for the [[Marines]] on [[Shells Town]], and a supporting ally to Luffy during the [[Romance Dawn Arc]]. She is very fond of Luffy and appreciated his help in defeating the [[Captain (Marine Rank)|Marine Captain]], [[Morgan]], and freeing [[Roronoa Zoro]]. She finds him to be a kind person and incredibly strong. Luffy was very kind to Rika and at one point saved her when she was thrown by a Marine. He came to like her a lot, despite only getting to know her for a short while.

When Luffy arrived in Shells Town to recruit Zoro, he found Rika running into the Marine base courtyard in order to give Zoro some food. After saving her, he quickly befriended the young girl and got the full story about Zoro's situation which ultimately convinced him to get Zoro to join his [[Straw Hat Pirates|crew]], having initially been concerned about whether he was a good person or not. After defeating Morgan, he ate at Rika's mother's house and waved goodbye to her as he sailed out of Shells Town.

Rika was very thankful when Luffy saved her and was overjoyed when he told her that Zoro ate the rice balls she had made him. She informed Luffy about the situation regarding Zoro and wanted him to save the [[swordsman]]. She was amazed when she saw Luffy punch [[Helmeppo]] and called him cool for doing so. When her mother took her back inside, away from Luffy, she was visibly saddened. Upon Luffy's victory over Morgan she was happy to have him inside her home and complimented him, but was upset when the Marines told him that he had to leave the island. She joined [[Koby]] with her mother to wave goodbye to him. She has kept a [[Bounty|bounty poster]] of Luffy since joining the Marines, and has it pinned onto her wall. Rika often refers to Luffy as "Onii-san" (big brother).

Luffy saved Rika as soon as he saw her get thrown out of the courtyard by a Marine, quickly befriending the young girl. After visiting Zoro, and feeding him the rice balls she had made, he informed her that Zoro enjoyed eating them in order to cheer her up. Luffy was grateful when she informed him about the situation regarding Zoro, as it convinced him to recruit Zoro. He was amused when Rika told him that she thinks he is cool for punching Helmeppo, and was happy when she commented how strong he is after he defeated Morgan. He waved goodbye to Rika, as well as her mother, Koby and the Marines as he sailed out of Shells Town.

===Marines===
[[File:Shells Town Marines Salute Luffy.png|thumb|220px|Marines of Shells Town salute Luffy along with Koby.]]

The [[Marines]] stationed on [[Shells Town]] share a positive relationship with Luffy and are grateful to him for saving them, and their citizens, from their ruthless [[Captain (Marine Rank)|captain]], [[Morgan]]. Luffy was friendly to the Marines, due to his general apathy towards them, and acknowledged them as friendly people whilst being aware they are his natural enemies.

When Luffy arrived in Shells Town, the Marines stationed there had no idea he was a [[pirate]], thus allowing Luffy to wander the town freely. It was only after he had assaulted [[Helmeppo]], destroyed the statue of Morgan, and freed [[Roronoa Zoro|Zoro]] that they deduced he is a pirate. They fought him, at the behest of their vicious commander, Morgan, but were easily defeated. When Luffy was victorious against Morgan they showed their happiness at his victory and were grateful to him for liberating them from him. However, they ultimately kicked him off the island due to their obligations as Marines.

The Marines of Shells Town hold complete animosity towards pirates, but they were unaware that Luffy was one until after the events on Shells Town and thus did not have an opinion on him. They attacked him out of fear of Captain Morgan, but also out of their duty as Marines. They soon came to also fear Luffy as he was the first [[Gomu Gomu no Mi|Devil Fruit]] user they had encountered and realized they could not take him on, especially after he successfully freed Zoro. They watched in amazement as Luffy was easily besting Morgan and became extremely happy at his victory over their commander. Despite being grateful for what he had done, they were still obligated to kick him off the island for being a pirate, but gave him a salute as he sailed away to acknowledge him, even though doing so is a major violation of Navy law.

Luffy is generally apathetic towards the Marines, and judges people on their actions and words rather than allegiances. This resulted in him only becoming hostile towards the Marines when they tried to attack him, but became friendly with them once they showed their gratitude towards him for defeating Morgan. He found it amusing that they celebrated his victory, and understood that they must have hated their commander. However, Luffy is well aware that the Marines are his enemies and agreed to leave the island at their behest without holding a grudge, happily waving them all goodbye as he sailed away.

==Orange Town==
[[File:Orange Town Chases Out Straw Hats.png|thumb|left|220px|Luffy, Nami and Zoro, chased out of town by the citizens of Orange Town.]]

[[Orange Town]] is a young village in [[East Blue]] that was besieged by the [[Buggy Pirates]] during the [[Orange Town Arc]]. The citizens of Orange Town do not like Luffy and his [[Straw Hat Pirates|crew]] because they are [[pirate]]s and had assaulted their mayor, [[Boodle]], who they care for dearly. This led to them chasing him and his friends out of their town. Luffy does not hold a grudge over this misunderstanding, happily accepting the situation for what it is and fled the town with [[Nami]] and [[Roronoa Zoro|Zoro]].

For the entirety of the Orange Town arc, the citizens had fled as their town had been taken over by the Buggy Pirates. They returned to the town once Luffy and his crew had defeated the Buggy Pirates, but chased him and his friends out of their town, believing them to be responsible for the damage that had been done and for assaulting their mayor.

Due to a misunderstanding, the citizens do not like Luffy at all. After finding Boodle knocked out, they wished to know who had harmed him and grew furious when Luffy admitted he was responsible, and became even more angry when he admitted that he is also a pirate. This led them to chase Luffy and his friends out of their town, but were left confused by the local dog, [[Chouchou]], who Luffy had befriended, getting in their way, and were even more bewildered when the mayor, himself, wished to see them off.

Luffy had no qualms with the citizens chasing him out of town. He was initially disinterested with their situation and did not care that their town was being attacked by [[Buggy]] and his crew, only getting involved after befriending Nami, Chouchou and Boodle. He was extremely nonchalant towards them and openly admitted that he was the one responsible for knocking out Boodle, but choose not to inform them why he did it, as he believed it would be futile. Whilst being chased out he was smiling happily and praised them to Nami, finding them admirable for how much they cared about one person. He left some of Buggy's treasure behind so they could repair the damage done to their town as a bit of goodwill towards Boodle.

===Boodle===
[[File:Boodle Knockout.png|thumb|220px|Luffy knocks Boodle out to prevent him from fighting.]]

[[Boodle]] is the mayor of [[Orange Town]] and a supporting ally of Luffy during the [[Orange Town Arc]]. He is very friendly to Luffy when he first met him, wishing to aid him in his fight against the [[Buggy Pirates]], and was grateful for saving his town. Luffy got on well with Boodle, respecting him as a determined individual who wishes to defend his town, and cared for his well-being.

Whilst Luffy was trying to get the key from [[Chouchou]], Boodle arrived and explained the dog's story to Luffy and [[Nami]]. Feeling inspired by Luffy, Boodle prepared to take on Buggy and his crew, but was knocked out by Luffy. He woke up at the conclusion of the fight and thanked Luffy and his small crew for what they had done.

Despite him being a [[pirate]], Boodle showed no hostility whatsoever towards Luffy, and was more than willing to aid his crew mate, [[Roronoa Zoro|Zoro]], who had been injured. He felt comfortable enough to inform Luffy about why Chouchou was so devoted to the Pet Store. He was amazed to see Luffy had survived after being attacked by [[Richie]] and was worried for him when he intended to face off against the lion along with his owner, [[Mohji]]. When Nami went to attack Luffy he stopped her from doing so, as he understood Luffy was not to blame for the pet store being destroyed. Boodle became inspired by Luffy's determination to defend his village and decided to try and do so himself, telling Luffy to no longer get involved, but Luffy knocked him out. When he woke up, in contrast to the villagers that chased Luffy and his crew out of their town, he tearfully thanked Luffy for saving his village.

After meeting Boodle, Luffy openly stated he likes the old man. He listened to Boodle tell him the story of Chouchou, and it was because of this story that he became enraged by Mohji and Richie's actions against the dog. When Boodle gathered the courage to fight, Luffy encouraged him and was impressed by his determination to fight. However, after Nami's protests he promised her that he would not let Boodle die and proceeded to slam his face into a wall to knock him out, protecting him by making sure he could not get involved. After his victory against the Buggy Pirates, Luffy sailed out of Orange Town but was happy to see Boodle before he left and waved goodbye to him, and decided to leave him some of Buggy's treasure so he could repair the damage to his village.

==Cocoyasi Village==
[[File:Cocoyasi Citizens Celebrate Luffy's Victory.png|thumb|left|220px|The people of Cocoyasi Village celebrate Luffy's victory over Arlong.]]

The citizens of [[Cocoyasi Village]] reside in [[East Blue]], on the [[Conomi Islands]], and have become supporters of Luffy and the [[Straw Hat Pirates|Straw Hats]]. They have huge appreciation for what Luffy did for them and for his friendship with [[Nami]], who they all care for. Luffy likes the people of Cocoyasi Village and was happy to have saved them all from [[Arlong]].

For ten years, the people of Cocoyasi Village have been subjugated by Arlong and his [[Arlong Pirates|crew]]. When Luffy arrived, Nami had almost completed the fee she agreed with Arlong for him to leave her hometown. However, he betrayed this deal, devastating Nami, which compelled the citizens of Cocoyasi Village to fight him off for upsetting her. Luffy, however, stepped in on their behalf, at the request of Nami, and fought Arlong. Following his victory they celebrated with Luffy, Nami and his crew for three days before they happily watched as he sailed away, with Nami now being a member of the Straw Hat Pirates.

Initially, the people of Cocoyasi Village paid no mind to Luffy, unaware of who he was or his connections with Nami. As a result, they were confused why he, along with [[Roronoa Zoro|Zoro]], [[Sanji]] and [[Usopp]] were so willing to fight on their behalf. Through the words of [[Johnny]] and [[Yosaku]], they allowed Luffy to fight for them and cheered him on. They were overjoyed at Luffy's victory, having now regained their independence from the Arlong Pirates. Their trust in Luffy is extremely high, as they were happy with Nami, who they care for deeply, to join his crew, having faith in his abilities to keep her safe. They partied with Luffy and his crew for three days straight following his victory over Arlong and waved goodbye to them all as they left Cocoyasi Village.

Luffy arrived on Cocoyasi Village having very little interest in the village's current situation, and outright ignored [[Nojiko]]'s attempts to explain their's, and Nami's, plight. However, once Nami tearfully asked him to help her he became extremely determined to defeat Arlong and his entire crew for her, and by extension, for the people of Cocoyasi Village. He appreciated their support, and the help Nojiko and [[Genzo]] provided. Following his victory, he joyfully partied with the citizens of Cocoyasi Village and said goodbye to them all before leaving with Nami and his crew, whilst being amused that Nami had pickpocket all of them.

===Johnny and Yosaku===
[[File:Luffy Stops Johnny And Yosaku.png|thumb|220px|Luffy stops Johnny and Yosaku from interfering with Zoro's fight with Mihawk.]]

[[Johnny]] and [[Yosaku]] are the fishermen of [[Cocoyasi Village]], former [[Bounty Hunter|bounty hunters]], and allies to Luffy and the [[Straw Hat Pirates|Straw Hats]] during the [[Baratie Arc]] and the [[Arlong Park Arc]]. They both have great admiration and trust in Luffy, especially as their long time friend, [[Roronoa Zoro|Zoro]], was a member of his crew. Luffy was fond of the pair and was happy to have them along as allies whilst at the [[Baratie]], and again at Cocoyasi Village.

Luffy first met Johnny and Yosaku whilst out at sea after he and [[Usopp]] fired a canon ball at an island they were resting on. After a brief confrontation, that ended with Yosaku being treated for scurvy by the Straw Hats, they became friendly and directed the crew towards the Baratie as they were in need of finding a [[cook]]. At the Baratie they stayed aboard the ship with [[Nami]] but were tricked by her as she sailed away with the [[Going Merry]] and the crew's treasure. Following Luffy's victory over [[Krieg|Don Krieg]], Yosaku helped Luffy and [[Sanji]] reach Cocoyasi Village to meet up with Johnny, Zoro and Usopp to get Nami back. They worked as allies of the Straw Hats to help them defeat [[Arlong]] and his [[Arlong Pirates|crew]]. Following this victory, they decided to go continue their lives as bounty hunters, saying farewell to the Luffy and his crew, but eventually became fishermen for Cocoyasi Village.

Johnny and Yosaku got off to a bad start with Luffy after he hit them with a canon ball, with Johnny trying to attack the Straw Hat captain, but relented when he saw Zoro, his friend and fellow bounty hunter, was a member of his crew. The pair became friendly with Luffy and was extremely thankful after his crew saved Yosaku's life from scurvy. They felt extremely guilty for being tricked by Nami, resulting in Luffy and his crew losing their ship and treasure. Whilst Luffy fought against Don Krieg they took care of Zoro after his crushing defeat at the hands of [[Dracule Mihawk]] and agreed to sail ahead to try and get Nami back for him. The pair have great faith in Luffy's abilities and strength as a fighter and whilst on Cocoyasi Village they prevented the villagers from trying to attack Arlong, knowing they'd get killed, and instead made them wait for the arrival of Luffy and his crew, playing a key role in stirring up the villager's faith in Luffy and his friends. Despite their confidence in Luffy, they were terrified at the prospect of facing Arlong and initially tried to run away out of fear, but were compelled to ultimately fight after hearing about Nami's past. Following Arlong's defeat they decided to bid Luffy and his crew farewell but wished to meet them again one day. A sign of their great respect for Luffy is how they refer to him as "brother".

Luffy gets on well with Johnny and Yosaku despite having angered them when he hit them with a canon ball. Due to being friends with Zoro he viewed them as his friends by extension, and was more than happy for Nami to heal Yosaku back to full health. Luffy became grateful for the aid they provided, such as directing them towards the Baratie to find a cook. He sympathized with their desire to help Zoro in his fight with Mihawk, despite stopping them, and was thankful to them for taking care of his swordsman after he was seriously injured from the fight. He trusted them enough to sail on ahead and go after Nami whilst he dealt with Don Krieg. Luffy did not harbor any grudge towards the pair for being tricked by Nami and losing his ship. However, he later became extremely angry with Johnny when he claimed that Nami had killed Usopp, threatening to beat him up for saying such things about her. After his victory, he was very thankful for all their help and hoped to see them again some day.

===Nojiko===
[[File:Nojiko Keeping Luffy Alive.png|thumb|left|220px|Nojiko keeps Luffy's head above water.]]

[[Nojiko]] is [[Nami]]'s adoptive older sister, the owner of a tangerine farm in [[Cocoyasi Village]], and a supporting ally during the [[Arlong Park Arc]]. She initially tried to discourage Luffy and his [[Straw Hat Pirates|crew]] from getting involved but accepted his help after realizing how strong he is. Nojiko came to see Luffy as a hero after his victory over [[Arlong]] and trusted him to look after Nami as a member of his crew. Although he initially disregarded her, Luffy appreciated Nojiko's help during his fight with Arlong and respects her as Nami's adoptive sister.

The two first met when Luffy arrived on Cocoyasi Village and had just gotten into a dispute with Nami. Nojiko intended to inform Luffy, and his crew, about the situation with Nami and the [[Arlong Pirates]] but he chose not to listen to her and walked off. They would cross paths again when Luffy, along with [[Sanji]], [[Roronoa Zoro|Zoro]] and [[Usopp]], walked to [[Arlong Park]] after Nami pleaded for his help. Throughout the fight, Nojiko supported Luffy and helped to prevent him from drowning, along with [[Genzo]]. She was overjoyed at his victory and watched happily as he sailed away with Nami as a part of his crew.

It appears Nojiko did not want Luffy to be involved with Nami's business as she intended to inform him about the difficult situation Nami's in as a means to discourage him but was cut short by his blunt refusal to listen. This encounter made her realize why Nami has a hard time dealing with him as he is just as stubborn as she is. However, this rough first meeting did not give her any bad feelings towards Luffy. She was shocked, like most of the villagers, at the raw strength Luffy possesses and soon began to place her faith in him. This led to her aiding the Straw Hat captain when he was in danger of dying after being thrown into the pool of water. She worked with Genzo to keep his head above water, thanks to his [[Gomu Gomu no Mi|Devil Fruit]] powers, whilst also trying to break the rock that was keeping him underwater. At one point she was worried when he stopped breathing and tried to resuscitate him. She was relieved to see he had regained consciousness and was overjoyed when Sanji broke him free. Following Luffy's victory she came to respect him a lot and was more than happy with Nami sailing with him and his crew. She is extremely grateful to him for having liberated her and her village from the Arlong Pirates.

When Luffy first met Nojiko he openly refused to listen to her offer of informing him about Nami's past, instead choosing to go for a walk, as he had already made up his mind about Nami and thus did not care to hear what Nojiko had to say. Nonetheless, he was extremely grateful for her aid in keeping him alive after he had been thrown into the pool of water and for helping to get him free to continue his fight with Arlong. Following his victory he had come to acknowledge her as an important person in Nami's life.

===Genzo===
[[File:Luffy And Genzo At Bell-mère's Grave.png|thumb|220px|Genzo makes Luffy promise him not to take Nami's smile away.]]

[[Genzo]] is the sheriff of [[Cocoyasi Village]] and a supporting ally to Luffy and the [[Straw Hat Pirates|Straw Hats]] during the [[Arlong Park Arc]]. Although having some reservations over Luffy getting involved in his village's business, he became extremely grateful to Luffy for defeating [[Arlong]], and especially for helping [[Nami]]. Luffy appreciated Genzo's aid during his fight with Arlong and respects him as an important person in Nami's life, having stood by the promise he made to him before leaving with her.

After Nami had betrayed him and his crew, Luffy followed her to Cocoyasi Village in order to get her back. Once Nami asked for Luffy's help, he walked to [[Arlong Park]], alongside [[Sanji]], [[Roronoa Zoro|Zoro]] and [[Usopp]] in order to take on Arlong before Genzo and the rest of the villagers took matters into their own hands. With some help from Genzo at one point, Luffy was able to defeat Arlong and liberate the village. During the subsequent party Luffy met Genzo at [[Bell-mère]]'s grave, Nami's foster mother, and promised Genzo he would never take Nami's smile away before leaving the next day.

Genzo appeared somewhat perplexed about Luffy's willingness to get involved with his village's plight, as he was determined to take matters into his own hands for what Arlong had done to Nami. However, after witnessing Luffy's strength, and realizing he was capable of actually defeating Arlong, he chose to support the Straw Hat captain. When Luffy was thrown into the water whilst weighed down by a piece of rock to his feet, Genzo aided him by keeping his head above the water, thanks to Luffy's [[Gomu Gomu no Mi|Devil Fruit]] ability, and worked with [[Nojiko]] to break the rock after they restarted his breathing. At one point, he was worried that Luffy would not make it. He was relieved that Luffy had broken free and watched on as he fought Arlong. He was overjoyed at the Straw Hat captain's eventual victory. Genzo came to see Luffy as a good friend to Nami and felt he could trust him with her life, however he still felt compelled to warn Luffy that he would hunt him down and kill him if he ever took Nami's smile away. As Luffy left with Nami and the rest of his crew, he reminded Luffy to not forget the promise they had made.

Although Luffy only intended to defeat Arlong for Nami's sake, he was more than happy to have helped Genzo and the rest of the villagers. He appreciated the help that Genzo provided to him by keeping his head above water so he would not die. He also understands how much of an important person Genzo is to Nami and reassured him that he will never take Nami's smile away, despite initially being flabbergasted when he threatened him. When Genzo reminded him of the agreement they made as he sailed out of Cocoyasi Village, he gave him a thumbs up to show his commitment to their promise.

==Drum/Sakura Kingdom==
===Wapol===
[[File:Gomu Gomu Gomu Gomu no Bazooka.png|thumb|left|220px|Luffy sending Wapol flying.]]

[[Wapol]] is a king, a one-time [[pirate]], and was Luffy's enemy during the [[Drum Island Arc]]. He and Luffy grew to strongly dislike each other throughout the arc. Luffy believes Wapol is a terrible and cruel [[king]] who does not properly understand what it means to be a pirate, while Wapol views Luffy as an extremely annoying brat who gets in the way of his desires and disregards his rights as a king, often throwing tantrums over him. By the time of the [[Levely Arc]], Wapol seems to let go of his grudge against Luffy.

They first met when the Straw Hats were heading towards Drum Island and Wapol tried to ambush Luffy and his crew. He greatly annoyed Luffy by taking a bite out of the [[Going Merry]] and the two quickly ended up fighting. Wapol tried to eat Luffy, but this was futile because of Luffy's [[Gomu Gomu no Mi|Devil Fruit]]. Luffy then quickly defeated Wapol and sent him flying out to sea. Wapol was later able to catch up to Luffy on [[Drum Island]] and, in his quest for vengeance, tried to hinder his attempts to carry both [[Nami]] and [[Sanji]] to safety, but this also failed. Wapol appeared again towards the end of the arc, having returned to try to retake his throne. The two fought yet again, and although this fight dragged out longer than their first bout, the results remained the same.

Luffy has an extremely low opinion of Wapol and does not like him for trying to eat a part of his ship. He was also irritated when Wapol tried to prevent him from getting Nami to a doctor. He was angry with Wapol for trying to shoot down the flag atop his former castle, believing him to be a fraud for not understanding the meaning of the flag. He also does not appear to take Wapol's threats seriously, as he ignored him numerous times and shouted at Wapol that he does not care he is a king under the [[World Government]].

Throughout the Drum Island Arc, Wapol's spitefulness and childish tantrums were most apparent regarding Luffy, often getting upset by the latter's disregard of him being a former king recognized by the World Government, even planning to make laws to specifically stop some of the irritating things Luffy did to him. Despite his clear hatred of Luffy, he still tried to offer him positions in his kingdom as a way to beg for mercy just before the Straw Hat captain defeated him. However, the time of the Levely Arc, Wapol seemed to drop his grudge against Luffy as it was thanks to him that he was able to find new success and rule a [[Black Drum Kingdom|new kingdom]].

===Dalton===
[[File:Dalton Stunned After Luffy's Victory.png|thumb|220px|Dalton stunned that Luffy has defeated Wapol.]]

[[Dalton]] is the king of the [[Sakura Kingdom]] (formerly known as Drum Kingdom), a former Royal Guard under the former king, [[Wapol]], and an ally to Luffy and his [[Straw Hat Pirates|crew]] during the [[Drum Island Arc]]. He was initially hostile, due to Luffy's status as a [[pirate]], but was won over by his sincerity and has come to respect the Straw Hat captain for defeating Wapol and saving the kingdom. Luffy respects Dalton highly and was immensely thankful for his aid to help his friend, [[Nami]], get medical help.

Luffy arrived on Drum Island, after defeating Wapol, and was met with a hostile reception by Dalton and the villagers. However, Dalton was won over by his and [[Nefertari Vivi|Vivi]]'s pleas to help their friend and allowed them to stay in the village. He informed Luffy of the kingdom's current situation and how, despite being famous for their medical expertise, there is only one [[doctor]] on the entire island, [[Kureha|Dr. Kureha]]. He told him where he could find her and wished him luck on his journey there. Dalton would later encounter Luffy when he traveled to the residence of Dr. Kureha to confront Wapol, but arrived after Luffy had already defeated the tyrannical former king.

Due to the kingdom having recently been attacked by the [[Blackbeard Pirates]], Dalton became extremely hostile to any and all pirates, holding Luffy and his crew at gun point. However, he was convinced by Luffy's sincere wish to just help his friend and chose to aid him. He soon became friendly with Luffy and informed him about the current situation of the kingdom. This friendship turned him into an ally as he was more than willing to direct Luffy to the location of the doctor and tried to warn him about the difficulty of the journey. By the end of the Drum Island arc, he was amazed, and thankful, that Luffy defeated Wapol, liberating the kingdom once and for all, and ultimately came to see him as a genuinely kind hearted person. Following the time skip, he attended the [[Levely]], having since become king, and made friends with [[Rebecca]] who is very fond of Luffy, admitting to the princess that he likes Luffy a lot.

Luffy did not initially reciprocate the hostile reception he got from Dalton and pleaded with him to allow his friend to see a doctor, however, he was furious when one of his men shot Vivi and went to attack them all until Vivi stopped him. After being convinced by Vivi, he begged Dalton to allow his friend to see a doctor. He was very grateful when Dalton allowed him and his crew to land on the island and was even more grateful for the information he provided to find their only doctor. Luffy also became empathetic to Dalton and the citizen's plights, understanding their animosity for pirates and hatred for Wapol, who Luffy also hated. This led Luffy to eventually fight, and defeat, the former king on behalf of Dalton, as well as his new friend, [[Tony Tony Chopper|Chopper]].

===Dr. Kureha===
[[File:Luffy Begs Kureha To Save His Friends.png|thumb|left|220px|Luffy begs Dr. Kureha to save his friends.]]

[[Kureha]] is a [[doctor]], the head of the [[Isshi-100]], the adoptive mother and mentor to [[Tony Tony Chopper|Chopper]], and an ally to Luffy and his [[Straw Hat Pirates|crew]] during the [[Drum Island Arc]]. The two have a friendly, but volatile, relationship due to Kureha's strong willed, no-nonsense, personality. Kureha is impressed by Luffy's sheer will power and devotion to his friends, but also believes him to be a dangerous person. Luffy was extremely grateful for Kureha's aid in helping [[Nami]] and [[Sanji]] get better.

After leaving [[Little Garden]], Nami became sick from a mysterious illness she picked up, from a bug, whilst there, which led to the crew traveling to [[Drum Island]] in order to get her to a doctor. Arriving, they were informed that Dr. Kureha is the only doctor on the entire island and that she lives on top of a mountain with no direct footpath. Luffy thus decided to carry Nami up the mountain in order for Kureha to make her better. Whilst on their way, Sanji was injured and Luffy had to carry him, as well. Once Luffy arrived, Dr. Kureha and Chopper immediately began treatment for the three friends. She later spectated Luffy, Sanji and Chopper's fight against [[Wapol]] and his [[Bliking Pirates|men]], where he eventually defeated the former king.

Kureha, despite being 139 years old, is in-denial about her elderliness and thus takes offence to Luffy referring to her as "old", often attacking him. She was also annoyed when Luffy tried to eat Chopper and chased after him. Despite this, she is very sincere to Luffy and his crew mate's situation, as she immediately began medical procedures to get him, Nami and Sanji back to health, and took care of Sanji when he re-injured himself in the fight against Wapol's men. She was stunned when Chopper informed her that Luffy had carried both his friends up the mountain, finding it inconceivable that someone could do such a thing, and reassured a desperate Luffy that she will make his friends well again. It is perhaps this determination, and the fact he defeated Wapol, that she was ultimately happy that Chopper joined his crew, even though she stated that he is a dangerous man after noting that he bears the initial, "[[Will of D.|D]]", in his name. She smiled as she watched Luffy dispatch the former king, commenting that the Drum Kingdom has been brought down by a [[pirate]].

Luffy was very grateful to Dr. Kureha for saving his friends. When he arrived at her home he begged her to save Nami and Sanji, instead of his own life, and was relieved when she reassured him that she would help them. He tried to recruit her into his crew at one point, as he still needed a doctor on his [[Going Merry|ship]], but was rejected by her. Luffy was mostly unbothered when she attacked him and continued to pester her to join his crew, whilst offending her about her age. However, he became fearful of her violent nature, as he ran in fear when she chased after him and Sanji for wanting to eat Chopper.

==Jaya==
===Masira and Shoujou===
[[File:Luffy Befriends Masira and Shoujou.png|thumb|220px|Luffy sitting and talking with Masira and Shoujou.]]

[[Masira]] and [[Shoujou]] are sworn brothers, followers of [[Mont Blanc Cricket]] and allies to Luffy and the [[Straw Hat Pirates|Straw Hats]] during the [[Jaya Arc]]. Despite having gotten off to a bad start with Luffy and his crew, the two brothers became very good friends with Luffy and were grateful for his efforts in solving the mystery of the lost [[Shandora|City of Gold]] for them and Cricket. Luffy was initially hostile to the two brothers when they briefly met, but became good friends with them after befriending and saving Cricket.

Whilst looking for how to get to a [[Sky Island]], Luffy, [[Roronoa Zoro|Zoro]] and [[Sanji]] dived into the water to investigate a ship that had fallen from the sky. Masira soon arrived and dived into the sea as well where he met Luffy and his crew mates. After escaping from a giant sea turtle and landing back on the Going Merry, Luffy, Zoro and Sanji kicked Masira off their ship. Later, as they were sailing out of [[Jaya]], the crew met Shoujou who intercepted their ship. Initially having a pleasant conversation, he became hostile when Luffy revealed he had beaten up his brother, Masira, and tried to attack Luffy and his crew but they managed to flee. The brothers would encounter Luffy and his crew again on Jaya when they saved their leader, Mont Blanc Cricket, and became immediately grateful and friendly.

The brothers shared hostility towards Luffy but it never mounted to anything serious. In fact, both of them got on well with the Straw Hat captain and only really became hostile through misunderstandings. When they reunite on Jaya, after Luffy's [[doctor]], [[Tony Tony Chopper|Chopper]], saves Mont Blanc Cricket, they become completely good friends with Luffy. Shoujou even praised Luffy for being able to literally kick Masira off his ship despite being small, even though he got angry with the Straw Hat captain over this incident earlier. Masira often comically blushes when Luffy compares him to a monkey, taking it as a compliment. The two brothers were more than happy to help the Straw Hats reach a Sky Island and helped to reinforce the Going Merry for the dangerous trip. They were also very grateful to him for retrieving Cricket's possessions after the [[Bellamy Pirates]] robbed them. They were with Cricket when they saw Luffy's shadow in the sky and heard him ring the famous [[Shandorian Golden Belfry Bell|bell]], informing them both that the lost City of Gold they had all been searching for is in the sky, not the ocean. They were incredibly happy at this revelation and were happy to finally move on to their next dream.

Luffy was mostly indifferent towards the two brothers, unintentionally winning them over before accidentally angering them both. He annoyed Masira for taking the ‘treasure' he found whilst salvaging the ship and angered Shoujou for having attacked Masira. However, he held no actual animosity towards them and when he reunited with them he immediately informed them of Cricket's condition and that he and his crew were helping him. This led to him sitting outside and having a pleasant chat with the brothers. Luffy was very thankful for the help they provided so that he and his crew could reach Skypiea. He became endeared to the determination that Cricket and the brothers have to finding the lost City of Gold in order to exonerate Cricket's ancestor, [[Mont Blanc Noland]]. This led to Luffy becoming determined to ring the golden bell on [[Skypiea]]. He called out to the brothers and Cricket when he finally managed to do so, hoping they could hear the bell.

===Mont Blanc Cricket===
[[File:Cricket Showing his Gold.png|thumb|left|220px|Mont Blanc Cricket shows Luffy a gold statue of a South Bird.]]

[[Mont Blanc Cricket]] is the descendant of famed explorer, and falsely branded liar, [[Mont Blanc Noland]], and a former [[pirate]]. He met, and became friends, with Luffy and his [[Straw Hat Pirates|crew]] during the [[Jaya Arc]]. He came to like Luffy a great deal and offered vital information on how he could reach a [[Sky Island]], and confined in him his goals of finding the lost [[Shandora|City of Gold]]. Luffy was impressed by his determination to find the missing city and became determined to help him in this endeavor.

Whilst on Jaya, after Luffy's confrontation with the [[Bellamy Pirates]], [[Nico Robin]] found a lead on a man named Mont Blanc Cricket who might have information on how to reach a Sky Island. The crew arrived at his house and, after a brief misunderstanding, aided Cricket back to health from his decompression sickness due to his constant deep sea dives. They learned of Cricket's story, about his ancestor being branded an infamous liar for claiming there was a City of Gold on [[Jaya]], and how that has tarnished his name as well. He then provided information on how to reach a Sky Island, admitting it's possible the City of Gold is in the sky, but that he was skeptical. Whilst Luffy and his crew were out looking for a [[South Bird]], Cricket was attacked and robbed by the Bellamy Pirates, which infuriated Luffy. After getting revenge, and reclaiming Cricket's stolen items, Luffy traveled to Skypiea where he made it his absolute goal to ring the famous [[Shandorian Golden Belfry Bell|bell]] of Shandora, that Mont Blanc Noland once mentioned, to let Cricket know that the City of Gold he is looking for is in the sky, not in the ocean.

Cricket became a close friend to Luffy and his crew. He initially thought they were there to rob him and pulled the Straw Hat captain into the water before fighting [[Sanji]]. However, after collapsing from decompression sickness and being mended back to health by Luffy's crew mate, [[Tony Tony Chopper|Chopper]], he apologized and became friends with Luffy. He then held a home party with him and informed the Straw Hat Pirates of his current situation and why he dives into the sea everyday. After he noted Luffy's determination to visit a Sky Island, despite his own skepticism on whether it exists or not, he decided to provide vital information on how to do so, such as details of the [[Knock Up Stream]], the necessity of a South Bird and even reinforced the [[Going Merry]] for the dangerous trip. He was very appreciative of Luffy for reclaiming his possessions that were stolen by the Bellamy Pirates, despite not wanting him to get involved, and waved Luffy and his crew off as they set out to reach Skypiea. He was moved to complete tears when he heard the famous bell, that his ancestor spoke of, ringing with Luffy's shadow in the sky. He thanked the Straw Hat captain for giving him closure, and absolution, on his, and his ancestor's, legacy.

Luffy was greatly impacted by Cricket's story and was impressed by his determination to find out the truth on whether the City of Gold existed or not. He was furious when the Bellamy Pirates had attacked and robbed him, and returned to [[Mock Town]] in order to confront Bellamy. He defeated the captain in a single punch and returned the stolen items to Cricket before he set off to go to Skypiea. He was very thankful for Cricket's help to reinforce the Going Merry and the information he provided to reach Skypiea. Whilst on the Sky Island, he made it his goal to ring the bell for Cricket as he was saddened that he has to spend his life vindicating himself because his ancestor was falsely branded a liar. He argued with [[Nami]] about the need to complete this goal and fought off Enel in order to succeed in this endeavor. He called out to Cricket, as he finally rang the bell, hoping he could hear it. When he landed back on a cloud, he asked Nami if she thinks Cricket heard the bell ring, with Nami affirming that she thinks he did.

==Skypiea==
[[File:Luffy Celebrating With Skypieans And Shandians.png|thumb|220px|Luffy celebrating with both Skypieans and Shandians.]]

[[Skypiea]] is a [[Sky Island|sky island]] that is ruled by [[Gan Fall]] and was previously ruled by the self proclaimed "[[God]]", [[Enel]]. The people of Skypiea are divided into two, the [[Skypieans]] and the [[Shandians]]. Whilst the former are non-aggressive, the latter are. Luffy and his crew got on generally well with the Skypieans, but were immediately attacked by a member of the Shandians. Eventually, they both worked with Luffy to defeat Enel and save everyone on the sky island. Both groups now recognize Luffy and his [[Straw Hats|crew]] as heroes.

Luffy and his crew arrived on the sky island and entered into Skypiea but were marked as criminals for not paying the entrance fee. He briefly makes friends with some Skypieans but is attacked by the law enforcement of Skypiea for being criminals, eventually escalating tensions. Due to this, Luffy and his crew are forcibly taken to [[Upper Yard]], a sacred piece of land where Enel and his Priests reside. It is throughout this location that they meet members of the Shandians and begin to fight Enel. Luffy had the desire to ring the famous [[Shandorian Golden Belfry Bell]] in order to vindicate [[Mont Blanc Noland]] and inform his descendant, [[Mont Blanc Cricket]], of the city of gold's location. Having successfully defeated Enel, and ringing the bell, he had saved and ultimately liberated the island of Enel, making him a hero.

The Skypieans and the Shandians are greatly fond of Luffy for having saved them from Enel who was intending to destroy the entire sky island. Not only that, but they acknowledged Straw Hat as having played a crucial role in ending the dispute between the Skypieans and the Shandians over the claim for Upper Yard. They held celebrations with Luffy and his crew, and later tried to offer up a broken golden column as a reward to them. They were greatly disappointed that they did not get to say their goodbye to him and his crew but chose to ring the bell instead. They hope that Luffy and his crew will visit them again some day.

Luffy gets on well with the Skypieans following their rough start after being marked as a criminal. At one point he was seen as an enemy to the Shandians but by the end of the [[Skypiea Arc]] had managed to win them over. He partied with both groups before stealing some of their treasure that was lost inside the giant snake, [[Nola]], that lives on Skypiea. He mistakenly believed that the people of Skypiea were chasing him and his crew for the treasure they had taken and ran away without saying goodbye, not realizing that they were trying to give him a giant golden column as a reward.

He made numerous allies among both the Skypieans and the Shandians, such as Gan Fall who was the former ruler of Skypiea before Enel dethroned him, and [[Aisa]], a child Shandian, who sees Luffy as a hero. After Enel's defeat to Luffy, Gan Fall was able to be reinstated as the leader of Skypiea and started working to create coexistence among the Shandians and the Skypieans. Gan Fall, himself, compared Luffy favorably to his old friend, [[Gol D. Roger]]. Luffy also made friends with the Shandian warrior, [[Wyper]], who was originally antagonistic to Luffy and the Straw Hats but became a crucial ally. He was moved by Luffy's determination to ring the bell on Skypiea for the descendant of Mont Blanc Noland, as Noland was a close friend of his own ancestor, [[Kalgara]]. Following Enel's defeat he had become much more open to foreigners and is extremely grateful for what Luffy and the Straw Hats had done. He hopes to see them return to Upper Yard one day. Luffy also became close friends with the Skypieans, [[Pagaya]], and his daughter, [[Conis]], who were the first friends the Straw Hats made on Skypiea.

===Gan Fall===
[[File:Gan Fall, Nami, Aisa And Luffy.png|thumb|left|220px|Gan Fall and Luffy, along with Nami and Aisa, whilst inside Nola's stomach.]]

[[Gan Fall]] is the current, and two-time, [[God of Skypiea|God]] of [[Skypiea]] and an ally to Luffy and the [[Straw Hat Pirates|Straw Hats]] during the [[Skypiea Arc]]. He is on very good terms with Luffy, finding him to be a natural ally against [[Enel]] and thus chose to work with him. Although he initially had his doubts, he came to respect Luffy highly like his old friend, [[Gol D. Roger]]. Luffy is fond of Gan Fall, making friends with him quickly and appreciating his assistance in defeating Enel.

When Luffy and his crew arrived on Skypiea they were immediately attacked by a [[Shandia]] warrior. Gan Fall came to his aid and forced the attacker to flee, after briefly acquainting himself with Luffy and his crew, he gave them a whistle that will summon him to their aid and left. Gan Fall would not meet Luffy again until he, and [[Pierre]], along with [[Nami]] and [[Aisa]], were swallowed up by the giant snake, [[Nola]]. Although succeeding in escaping with Nami, he accidentally left Luffy and Aisa behind and sent Pierre to rescue them. Following his defeat to Enel, he watched Luffy battle the supposed God and was pleased to see he had won. Following Luffy's victory, he became God once again.

Gan Fall, through his role as "Knight of the Sky", was more than willing to aid Luffy and his crew. He saved them as they arrived on Skypiea and would assist Luffy as best he could for the remainder of the arc, having saved [[Tony Tony Chopper|Chopper]] and Nami at various points. When Luffy was being left behind inside Nola, he sent his pet, Pierre, to save him. His trust in Luffy is very high, as when he had been defeated by Enel he decided to put his faith in the Straw Hat captain to save Skypiea, and tried to aid him in this endeavor by forcing [[Giant Jack]] to fall westwards so the Straw Hat captain could reach Enel. He was initially shocked to find out Luffy is actually [[captain]] of his crew, but watched on in amazement as he fought against Enel, whilst also cheering him on to ring the [[Shandorian Golden Belfry Bell|bell]] of [[Shandora]]. He was moved to tears when Luffy finally defeated Enel and rang the famous bell. He has come to respect Luffy, as after the events of Skypiea, he favorably noted Luffy's striking similarities to his old friend, Gol D. Roger, when talking with [[Nico Robin]].

Luffy appreciated Gan Fall's help throughout the Skypiea arc and respected him as a capable warrior. When he first met Gan Fall he found him weird and confusing, not understanding what he was talking about due to having no knowledge of how Sky Islands work. He thus would refer to him as "Weird guy" whenever talking to him. Nonetheless, when he and his crew were first attacked on Skypiea he was grateful for his aid. He was happy to have had him as an ally and became even more grateful for the aid he provided for the rest of his crew throughout their time on Skypiea. He was furious to see he, along with Robin, [[Roronoa Zoro|Zoro]] and [[Wyper]], had been severely injured by Enel and swore to defeat him. He was happy to have saved all of Skypiea from Enel and that he had been made God again.

===Enel===
[[File:Luffy Kicks Enel.png|thumb|220px|Luffy lands a blow on Enel.]]

[[Enel]] is the former "[[God of Skypiea|God]]" of [[Skypiea]] and the main antagonist of the [[Skypiea arc]]. The two completely despise each other and see the other as enemies. Enel dislikes Luffy for tarnishing his self-belief that he is a god and for interfering with his plans. Luffy hates Enel for his arrogance and his intentions to destroy all of Skypiea, as well as for hurting his friends.

Luffy arrived on Skypiea via the [[Knock Up Stream|knock-up stream]] and quickly befriended some [[Skypieans]]. He was soon informed about Enel and how he is the god of the island. The two would not actually meet until towards the end of the arc, once Enel's ultimate plan had been set in motion. Luffy confronted him atop his ship and fought against him in order to save [[Nami]]. Even though Nami, and the rest of his [[Straw Hat Pirates|crew]], were saved, Luffy still chose to persist against the supposed "God" and, with the help of Nami and some others, he was able to defeat him, saving all of Skypiea.

Luffy caught the attention of Enel because he was breaking his country's laws. Nonetheless, Enel's extreme hubris and arrogance meant he did not necessarily hate or dislike Luffy, at least initially, as he believed himself to be too divine to concern himself with Luffy and his crew. Instead, he chose to make a game out of their shenanigans and proceeded to partake in said game. Enel's attitude towards Luffy changed when he proved his prediction, regarding the outcome of his game, wrong. This then led to a confrontation between the two and Enel soon realized that Luffy is naturally immune to his [[Goro Goro no Mi|Devil Fruit]] powers, the main source of his claim to being a god, causing him to frantically panic as the justification for his arrogance, and sense of superiority, was instantly shattered. After Luffy defeated him he was in denial, stating that he could never be defeated. He decided not to pursue Luffy and the Straw Hats and instead chose to continue with his original plan of going to Fairy Vearth, which turned out to be the [[moon]].

Luffy loathed Enel's god complex and believed him to be a despicable person for how he treated his subjects and questioned his claims about his right to do what he pleases to people. When he came across his crew mates, who were all easily defeated by Enel, and discovered he had taken Nami, he was furious and promised to defeat him. Luffy was not aware that he is naturally immune to Enel's main source of power and was confused by his constant attacks on him that were not doing anything. He eventually grew frustrated and relentlessly attacked him. Eventually, he defeated Enel and was relieved to have saved all of Skypiea whilst simultaneously ringing the [[Shandorian Golden Belfry Bell|bell]] of [[Shandora]], achieving his goal of informing [[Mont Blanc Cricket]] of its location.

===Wyper===
[[File:Wyper Fights Luffy.png|thumb|left|220px|Wyper fights Luffy.]]

[[Wyper]] is a former [[Shandian|Shandia]] warrior, a member of [[God's Guards]] for [[Gan Fall]] and a minor antagonist turned ally to Luffy during the [[Skypiea Arc]]. Initially, due to his great pride as a Shandian, and disdain for outsiders, he was very hostile and aggressive towards Luffy and his [[Straw Hat Pirates|crew]]. However, through their indirect shared connection with [[Mont Blanc Noland]], and knowing he desires to defeat [[Enel]] like he does, he became an ally. Luffy found Wyper to be irritating because of his hostility, but ignored him for most of the arc, however, he was happy to have made an ally out of him and his people.

The Straw Hats arrived on Skypiea via the [[Knock Up Stream|knock up stream]] and soon became enemies of Enel. Whilst exploring [[Upper Yard]], Luffy eventually encountered Wyper and was warned by him to leave. He fought the Shandian warrior, after encountering him again, to a stalemate before being eaten by [[Nola]]. Later on, whilst witnessing his homeland being gradually destroyed by Enel, Wyper was informed of Luffy's true intentions, and decided to aid the Straw Hat captain by cutting down [[Giant Jack]] for him. He was greatly moved when Luffy successfully rang the [[Shandorian Golden Belfry Bell|bell]] and defeated Enel.

Due to his extreme pride as a Shandian warrior, he held a strong prejudice to outsiders and Luffy was no exception. When he met the Straw Hat captain he threatened him and told him to leave, and ferociously fought against him when he did not listen to his warning. However, due to his deep admiration for his ancestor, [[Kalgara]], and knowing of the close friendship he had with a man by the name of Mont Blanc Noland, he was shocked and moved when [[Nico Robin]] informed him of Luffy's intentions to ring the bell so the descendant of Noland, [[Mont Blanc Cricket]], would discover the location of the [[Shandora|Golden City of Shandora]] and exonerate Noland. Thus, he became a determined ally to Luffy and risked his life by using a [[Dials|reject dial]] to knock down Giant Jack, as per [[Nami]]'s request, to help him reach Enel. He cheered Luffy on passionately as he fought against Enel, having trusted him with the legacy of his ancestors to ring the golden bell once more. When Luffy succeeded in ringing the bell, whilst also defeating Enel, he was overjoyed. He has since dropped his prejudice to outsiders thanks to Luffy and smiled when he saw him and his crew were celebrating with his people.

Luffy disregarded Wyper for the most part, as he had no interest in his, or his people's, cause or business. He chose to ignore Wyper's warning to him and was mostly apathetic when Wyper tried to talk to him, instead choosing to carry on walking and singing, although he did apologize for his intrusion when Wyper informed him that his people own Upper Yard. He nonetheless fought against the Shandia warrior with great determination, finding him to be an equal opponent. Whilst attempting to reach Enel, Luffy was unaware that Wyper was the one responsible for cutting down Giant Jack for him, but was greatly appreciative of the help he and his people provided after he had defeated Enel.

===Aisa===
[[File:Luffy And Aisa.png|thumb|220px|Luffy and Aisa inside Nola's stomach.]]

[[Aisa]] is a young [[Shandia]] girl who is a supporting ally of Luffy during the [[Skypiea Arc]]. Initially hostile, she warmed up to Luffy and grew to have huge admiration for the Straw Hat captain after he defeated [[Enel]] and saved her people. Luffy is fond of Aisa, immediately being tolerant of her aggressive nature towards him, similar to how he is with [[Nami]], and appreciated her help when trying to take down Enel.

After the [[Straw Hat Pirates|Straw Hats]] arrived on [[Skypiea]], and were forcibly taken to [[Upper Yard]], they began fighting against Enel and his priests. Aisa would first meet Nami, who she warmed up to first, and eventually met Luffy inside [[Nola]] after they were eaten by the giant snake. After being accidentally left behind by Nami and [[Gan Fall]], Aisa and Luffy were able to escape the inside of the snake thanks to the help of [[Pierre]] and then tracked Enel down so Luffy could defeat him. She watched on as Luffy confronted the supposed [[God of Skypiea|God]] and tried to aid him when he was trying to get back up [[Giant Jack]]. She watched in amazement as Luffy finally defeated Enel and rang the [[Shandorian Golden Belfry Bell|Shandorian Bell]]. Before leaving, the two said their goodbyes.

Despite her initial hostility, and doubts regarding Luffy, she came to greatly admire him and now sees him as a hero. She told [[Raki]] that she wants to grow up to be a strong warrior like Luffy and was pleased she was the only one that got to say goodbye to him and his crew. Due to her strong minded personality, she is easily irritated by Luffy's simple mindedness, sometimes doubting him as a [[captain]] of his own crew. Nonetheless, she was left in amazement as he fought against Enel and was stunned to see he is immune to Enel's [[Goro Goro no Mi|lightning attacks]]. At one point, she tearfully asked Luffy if Skypiea was really going to be destroyed, worrying for her homeland. She was overjoyed at Luffy's victory over Enel and successfully ringing the bell for the first time in 400 years.

Luffy came to like Aisa a lot, appreciating her help when he was trying to take down Enel, and sees her as a good friend. For the most part, he was indifferent to her insults towards him and was laid back around her. He worked with Aisa to try and escape from Nola and trusted her when he wanted to reach Enel after he had attacked his crew and taken Nami, asking the young Shandia girl to take him to Enel using her "[[Mantra]]". Whilst trying to reach Enel he looked at her with concern as she cried over the possibility that her homeland might be destroyed. He was thus happy to have saved her and her people from Enel, and partied with them all before leaving.

==Water 7==
===Kokoro===
[[File:Kokoro And Luffy.png|thumb|left|220px|Kokoro decides to help Luffy reach Enies Lobby.]]

[[Kokoro]] is a [[mermaid]], the main conductor for the [[Sea Train]], the [[Puffing Tom]], and an ally to Luffy and the [[Straw Hat Pirates|Straw Hats]] during the [[Water 7 Arc]] and [[Enies Lobby Arc]]. She was very helpful to Luffy and his crew throughout their time on [[Water 7]] and came to see him as an incredibly courageous and insane person. She became endeared to Luffy that she personally drove another train, the [[Rocketman]], to [[Enies Lobby]] so he could save [[Nico Robin]]. Luffy was very thankful for all her help, from the information she provided to helping him save his crew mate.

Whilst out at sea, Luffy and his crew almost crashed their [[Going Merry|ship]] into the Puffing Tom, avoiding the collision they then met Kokoro, along with [[Chimney]] and her pet rabbit, [[Gonbe]]. Informing Kokoro of the condition of their ship, she personally wrote a letter for the Straw Hats to give to a man called [[Iceburg]] when they arrive on Water 7, as he will help fix their ship. She would appear again, following the commotion of Iceburg's assassination attempt and the revelation of who the members of [[CP9]] are, and offered to aid Luffy and his crew to reach Enies Lobby on another Sea Train. She later saved Luffy's crew after [[Rob Lucci]] flooded the tunnels they were in and sailed back with them all to Water 7.

Kokoro is very friendly towards Luffy and was willing to aid him throughout the Water 7 and Enies Lobby arc. When she first met him she provided information on Water 7, how to get there, and wrote a letter for him to give to the mayor of Water 7, Iceburg, to help get his ship fixed. When Luffy wished to go after Robin, she stopped the disputed between him and [[Paulie]] and volunteered to drive the Sea Train, the Rocketman, to Enies Lobby for him. She even risked her own life by joining in on the chaos of the battle and saved Luffy's crew from drowning, whilst in the process revealing herself to be a mermaid.

However, she has expressed some doubt about Luffy, as she made a sarcastic comment to [[Nami]] if he is meant to be her [[Pirate King]] after he got stuck between two buildings. However, she did state she likes him and finds him to be funny when he expressed his dream of becoming the Pirate King. When on Enies Lobby, she told Chimney, whilst watching Luffy stand atop the courthouse, that what Luffy has done is something no one else would be brave enough to do, and that by the end of the battle the entire world will know his name. She was shocked to find out that Luffy's grandfather is [[Monkey D. Garp]] and his father is [[Monkey D. Dragon]]. Following her return to Water 7, after the battle at Enies Lobby, she attended the funeral for Luffy and his crew's ship and partied with them all at [[Galley-La]]. She was happy to see her long time friend, [[Franky]], join Luffy's crew and waved them off when Luffy and his crew escaped Garp and the [[Marines]] on their new ship.

Luffy is very friendly towards Kokoro and appreciated the help she provided in order to reach Water 7, and again when trying to reach Enies Lobby. He was overjoyed when she informed him that Water 7 is where the best [[shipwright]]s in the world are and decided that it would be his crew's next destination. Before leaving, he and his crew hoped to see her again whilst in Water 7 and thanked her for the information she provided. He was annoyed with Kokoro when she sided with Paulie when he wished to sail to Enies Lobby after Robin despite the dangerous of [[Aqua Laguna]]. Notably, despite Luffy being overwhelmingly disinterested in women's appearances, when he met [[Camie]], another mermaid, he commented in disgust over the idea of seeing Kokoro as a mermaid, having been unaware of her true form up until then. He tends to refer to her as "Monster Granny".

==Sabaody Archipelago==
[[File:Sabaody Citizens After Luffy Punches Charlos.png|thumb|220px|Sabaody citizens left in complete shock at Luffy punching a World Noble.]]

[[Sabaody Archipelago]] is the final island in [[Paradise]] and is close to the [[Red Line]]. The people of Sabaody were initially indifferent to Luffy's arrival due to the island being a hotbed for [[pirates]] and is located virtually next door to [[Mary Geoise]] and [[Marineford]]. However, the citizens flew into a blind panic after the Straw Hat captain assaulted a [[World Noble]], gaining extreme notoriety among the people there. Luffy, himself, takes no interest in the people of Sabaody, as he just viewed the area as a stopping point before he goes to the [[New World]], but is furious for how they treat [[Fish-Men|fish-men]] and [[merfolk]].

When Luffy arrived on Sabaody, he was accompanied by [[Hatchan]], [[Camie]] and [[Pappag]] to visit [[Shakuyaku|Shakky]] in order to find someone to coat his [[Thousand Sunny|ship]]. However, due to the extreme discrimination towards fish-men and merfolk, and a thriving [[Slavery|slave trade]], Camie was captured and was sent to be auctioned off. This led to Luffy arriving at the [[Human Auctioning House]] to save her. Whilst there, a World Noble, [[Saint Charlos]], shot Hatchan, inciting Luffy's fury that led to him punching the World Noble, causing pandemonium on the island for its people. Eventually, Luffy and his crew were scattered by [[Bartholomew Kuma]]. He returned two years later to reunite with his crew, causing chaos once again, before leaving for [[Fish-Man Island]].

Due to the island being the last stop before entering the New World, it is often a rest stop for pirates and adventurers alike. This meant that Luffy did not stand out to the citizens living there, as there were plenty of notorious individuals like him, such as the other eight members of the [[Worst Generation]]. Furthermore, the citizens have a sense of security by the fact that they are situated so close to Marineford and Mary Geoise, which deters violent activity among the pirate groups. However, after Luffy punched a World Noble, an unthinkable act that incurred the wrath of the Navy's highest power, his name became infamous among the people of Sabaody. With many of the citizens in complete shock at what he had done and panicking when they realized what was to come next. 

Luffy did not care much for the citizens there, and was more than willing to cause chaos for all of them when a World Noble harmed his friend. However, he has great disdain for the slave trade on the island, being furious after witnessing a World Noble kill one of his slaves and had to be warned by Pappag of the consequences when he was about to attack him. He was further angered by the fact that his friend, Camie, had been kidnapped by slave traders. He also holds complete hatred for the extreme discrimination that fish-men and merfolk experience from the citizens of Sabaody.

===Shakuyaku===
[[File:Luffy Talks With Shakky.png|thumb|left|220px|Luffy talks with Shakky at her bar.]]

[[Shakuyaku]], otherwise known as Shakky, is a former [[pirate]], the owner of [[Shakky's Rip-off Bar]] in [[Sabaody Archipelago]] and the wife of [[Silvers Rayleigh]]. The two get on very well and both have high respects for each other. Shakky has openly stated her support for Luffy to become the [[Pirate King]] and has taken an interest in him. Luffy was amazed to find out she was hunted by his own grandfather, and the [[Marines|Marine]] hero, [[Monkey D. Garp]], and sees her as a kind woman.

The two met when Luffy arrived at her bar for information on a coater for their [[Thousand Sunny|ship]]. She directed them to the amusement park as that is where her husband, Rayleigh, who works as a coater, would sometimes go. She met Luffy again, along with her husband, after Luffy had assaulted a [[World Noble]]. Whilst there they discussed various things, such as Rayleigh being a member of the [[Roger Pirates]], the [[Void Century]] and [[One Piece]]. After the Straw Hats were separated by [[Bartholomew Kuma]], and following the [[Summit War of Marineford]], she helped Rayleigh track down Luffy's location so he could train him.

Shakky has openly admitted her admiration for Luffy and found him intriguing after meeting him at her bar. She was more than willing to give him and his crew shelter despite being pursued by an [[Admiral]] and held no animosity towards him despite her hostile past with his grandfather, Garp. She is aware of his similarities to [[Gol D. Roger]], since her husband, Rayleigh, is his former first mate, and thus supports the Straw Hat captain in his quest to become the Pirate King. Shakky was also very impressed by Luffy's refusal for any information on the location of One Piece, stating she is becoming a big fan of his. She aided Luffy in becoming stronger by deducing his location for Rayleigh so he could be trained by the legendary pirate. She finds Luffy amusing and could not help but laugh at seeing him raid her fridge.

Luffy is very friendly to Shakky and appreciated her help when looking for a coater, and again when she hid him from the Marines after he had assaulted a World Noble. He was very much interested in her past as a pirate when she informed him that she was once hunted down by his grandfather Garp and was curious about how old she was when she told him that she quit piracy 40 years ago. Luffy was also grateful for the information she provided regarding the other members of the [[Worst Generation]].

==Amazon Lily==
[[File:Luffy Irritated By Kuja Women.png|thumb|220px|Luffy annoyed when the Kuja women keep pulling his skin.]]

[[Amazon Lily]] is an empire made up of exclusively women who are known as the [[Kuja Tribe]]. They are ruled by the Pirate Empress, and former [[Shichibukai]], [[Boa Hancock]]. Their relationship with Luffy has been a roller coaster, they have a great interest in Luffy as he is the first man they have met, but soon hated him once it was apparent Hancock wanted him killed. However, after Luffy won over Hancock they became much more friendly and resumed their interest in him. Luffy is kind to the people of Amazon Lily and does not dislike any of them, even making genuine friends with a few, although he did find them annoying because of their curiosity of him.

Luffy arrived in Amazon Lily after [[Bartholomew Kuma]] sent him there from [[Sabaody Archipelago]]. After falling unconscious from eating mushrooms he was recovered by [[Marguerite]], [[Sweet Pea]] and [[Aphelandra]] who nursed him back to health, not initially realizing he is a man. Upon finding out he is a man they quickly put him in a cage but he was soon able to escape. They frantically tried to capture Luffy but continued to fail until he was eventually caught by Boa Hancock and her sisters. From then on they disliked him greatly and wished to see him killed, but he was able to survive his execution and win Hancock's favor, and eventual love. Since then, they themselves find Luffy very likable and interesting.

Due to Luffy being a man the women of Amazon Lily continuously surround him and play with his skin because it is so [[Gomu Gomu no Mi|stretchy]], having no knowledge of [[Devil Fruits]], which gives them the false idea that all men have rubber skin. Such is their lack of knowledge of men they also mistook Luffy's genitals for a mushroom when bathing him. They are very tolerable of Luffy and allow him to be the only man to live among them after Hancock accepted him. At one point, they held festivities with him, enjoying his party antics and found him fun. They care for Luffy, like their Empress, and were overjoyed when they were told he was coming back from the [[Summit War of Marineford]] and that he would be allowed into their country again. They let Luffy recuperate on their island after the battle, regularly keeping Hancock up to date on his recovery. They all refer to Luffy affectionately as "Luffy-sama".

Luffy likes the people of Amazon Lily, despite getting off to a bad start with them. He was initially annoyed with them not only for locking him up, but for taking his clothes, including his [[straw hat]]. He found them somewhat intimidating as they were capable of using [[Haki/Busoshoku Haki|Busoshoku Haki]] and thus could hurt him, prompting him to run away rather than fight. Once he was on their good side he felt comfortable enough to party with them all, but was soon harassed by them because of his rubber body, forcing him to run away. He has good relations with all of the Kuja tribe and appreciates their help when they cared for him, and for transporting him back to Sabaody Archipelago after the time skip.

Among the Kuja tribe, Luffy has made friends besides Hancock. He was able to befriend Marguerite, Sweet Pea and Aphelandra, as they were the ones to find him and nurse him back to health. It was also these three that had gotten to know Luffy better than the others and spoke favorably of him even though it led to them being [[Mero Mero no Mi|petrified]] by Hancock. He protected the three throughout his fight with Hancock's sisters and gave up the option of returning to his crew in order to save them. He grew especially close to Marguerite after he kidnapped her, as she was in possession of [[Silvers Rayleigh]]'s [[Vivre Card]]. The two somewhat bonded and Marguerite saved his life when he began to sink whilst trying to escape on a raft. Upon hearing his return from the Summit War of Marineford she wished to make him some clothes. He also got on good terms with [[Gloriosa]], who was, relatively speaking, one of the more accepting members of the Kuja tribe and was the one to convince Hancock to open herself up to him. She also informed Luffy about [[Portgas D. Ace|Ace]]'s planned execution.

===Gloriosa===
[[File:Luffy And Elder Nyon.png|thumb|left|220px|Luffy sat with Elder Nyon inside her home.]]

[[Gloriosa]], otherwise known as Elder Nyon, is the former Empress of the [[Kuja Tribe]] before [[Boa Hancock]] succeeded her, and is an ally to Luffy during the [[Amazon Lily Arc]]. She is one of the first people to be accepting of Luffy even though she is also against men being on the island, and will try to help him whenever she can. Luffy valued her aid throughout his time on [[Amazon Lily]] and is very friendly towards her like he is with all the Kuja women.

After Luffy was found by [[Marguerite]], [[Aphelandra]] and [[Sweet Pea]] and was brought to the Kuja Village, Elder Nyon arrived and informed all the women present that Luffy is a man, shocking them all. She would next make an appearance during Luffy's execution and took a keen interest in his performances against [[Boa Sandersonia]] and [[Boa Marigold]]. She counselled Boa Hancock to indulge Luffy after he helped cover Sandersonia's back and was present when he was with Hancock in the throne room where she revealed to Hancock who Luffy is and what he had done on [[Sabaody Archipelago]]. She later indirectly revealed that [[Portgas D. Ace|Ace]] was to be executed by the [[Marines]], sparking Luffy's rescue effort for his brother.

Unlike pretty much every other member of the Kuja Tribe, Elder Nyon is not that interested in Luffy, as she has the experience of dealing with men. However, she was the first that displayed a certain level of empathy for Luffy, as she was not as enthusiastic about his execution like the rest of the crowd was. Since Luffy caught Hancock's interest, she has acted as a mediator between Hancock and Luffy, counselling Hancock to talk with Luffy and open up to him. She also tries to keep Hancock's obsession with Luffy in check, often reminding her that his actions are not marriage proposals or a sign that they are lovers. She is completely accepting of Luffy's presence on the island, despite the Kuja having always outlawed men, and even had tea with him in her house, along with Marguerite.

Gloriosa was very grateful that he managed to convince Hancock to partake in the [[Summit War of Marineford]] for the sake of maintaining her [[Seven Warlords of the Sea|Warlord of the Sea]] title. She was also appreciative of Luffy's relationship with Hancock due to her suffering from "[[Love Sickness]]" over Luffy, an illness that has killed past rulers when their feelings for someone are suppressed. She ultimately sees Luffy as an important person for Hancock's sake, helping her overcome her past tragedies and to become more proactive as the ruler of Amazon Lily. She is impressed with Luffy's abilities, such as being able to use [[Haoshoku Haki]], and his selflessness when he asked Hancock to save Marguerite, Aphelandra and Sweet Pea over benefiting himself. Like Hancock and her sisters, she was stunned that Luffy admitted that he truly did punch a [[World Noble]]. She is especially impressive by how lucky he is, accomplishing things that should have been impossible for almost anybody. Such as getting the man-hating Hancock to fall in love with him just when he need her help the most and surviving after breaking into Impel Down and participating in the Summit War. Gloriosa wonder if the heavens themselves were supporting Luffy after he returned alive from participating in the Summit War.

Luffy is thankful for all the help Elder Nyon provided him with whilst he was on Amazon Lily. He was kind to her when he had tea whilst at her house and has shown to respect her. He was shocked when she told him that Hancock is a Shichibukai and that the Marines will likely be going to war with the [[Whitebeard Pirates]]. He became frantic when she informed him that Ace is about to be executed and explained to her that Ace is his brother, shocking her. He was thankful for her helpful information on how to get to [[Impel Down]] and the advice to convince Hancock to answer the Marine call to attend the Summit War of Marineford as a means of infiltrating the infamous prison.

==Fish-Man Island==
[[File:Luffy Declares Fish-Man Island To Be His Territory.png|thumb|220px|Luffy declares Fish-Man Island to be his territory to Big Mom.]]

[[Fish-Man Island]] is an underwater island ruled by [[Neptune|King Neptune]] and are inhabited by [[Fish-Men|fish-men]] and [[merfolk]]. Luffy and his crew got off to a bad start with the people of the island due to the assumption that they are the ones behind the numerous missing mermaids. Throughout their time there their relationship continued to sour but eventually they were recognized as heroes after defeating [[Hody Jones]] and saving the [[Neptune Family|Royal Family]]. Luffy likes the people of Fish-Man Island and has declared the island as his territory from [[Charlotte Linlin|Big Mom]].

The [[Straw Hat Pirates|Straw Hats]] arrived on Fish-Man Island after reuniting following the two year time skip. The Straw Hats were accused of the numerous kidnappings of Mermaids that began when they arrived, but this was later revealed to be [[Caribou]]. Matters were made worse for them when [[Shyarly|Madam Shyarly]] prophesied that Luffy would bring about the destruction of Fish-Man island. They were then taken to the [[Ryugu Palace]] where Luffy befriended the Princess, [[Shirahoshi]], and proceeded to take her out of the palace to explore the outside world, leading people to believe he had kidnapped her. Hody Jones, the main antagonist of the [[Fish-Man Island Arc]], launched his coup against the Royal Family and planned to have them all publicly executed. At this point, the people wanted Luffy to destroy the island, rather than let Hody be their king. Luffy and his crew, under the counsel of [[Jinbe]], saved the Royal Family and defeated Hody Jones and his [[New Fish-Man Pirates|crew]], becoming heroes to the fish-men and merfolk of the island. Before leaving, Luffy stopped members of the [[Big Mom Pirates]] harassing Fish-Man Island and contacted Big Mom herself to claim Fish-Man Island from her as his territory.

Despite their initial prejudice against Luffy, they now strongly admire the Straw Hat captain and acknowledge him as the hero of Fish-Man Island, and are openly friendly with him and his crew since their initial disdain for them. Throughout his fight with Hody Jones they cheered him on, as well as the rest of his crew. Their respect for Luffy reached a point where they started selling replica straw hats for people to wear to show their admiration for the Straw Hat captain. They view him equally to [[Edward Newgate|Whitebeard]], who was the original protector of Fish-Man Island, and [[Fisher Tiger]] who freed many slaves from [[Mary Geoise]]. Their love for Luffy, however, did not encourage them to offer up their blood for him when he was suffering from blood loss, due to their laws. They were overjoyed, however, when Jinbe offered up his own blood for him.

Luffy knew about the serious abuse fish-men and merfolk have received from [[humans]] and thus was sympathetic to them. He did not harbor any resentment for their false assumptions about him being a criminal on their island either, although he was irritated by the numerous fish-men who came to apprehend him when they believed he had kidnapped Princess Shirahoshi, as it hindered his ability to protect her from [[Vander Decken IX]]. At one point used his [[Haki/Haoshoku Haki|Haoshoku Haki]] on them so he could save her. Despite becoming a hero, Luffy had no intention of being one and was more than prepared to worsen the relations between humans and fish-men in order to save his friends, he ultimately had to be bribed with [[meat]] by Jinbe to follow his plan instead. Luffy does care for the people of Fish-Man Island and did not take too kindly to the threat Big Mom posed for the island, happily taking the blame for why there was a shortage of candy on the island, he also gave up the treasure he had earned and claimed the island from Big Mom as his own territory.

Whilst on Fish-Man island Luffy managed to befriend the three brothers of the Royal Family, [[Fukaboshi]], [[Ryuboshi]] and [[Manboshi]]. In particular, Fukaboshi actively aided Luffy in his fight with Hody Jones. He is also on good terms with King Neptune, who now is planning to declare Fish-Man Island to be under the protection of him and his crew. They all appreciate the positive impact Luffy has made on Shirahoshi, but also for saving their family and the island, and even rewarded Luffy and the Straw Hats with treasure. [[Minister of the Left]] became an ally of Luffy for what he has done and provided him and his crew with a new [[New World Log Pose|log pose]] for the [[New World]]. Madam Shyarly has become fond of Luffy despite her prophecy that he would destroy Fish-Man Island, and has taken an interest in him.

===Shirahoshi===
[[File:Shirahoshi Crying Over Luffy's Departure.png|thumb|left|220px|Shirahoshi cries as Luffy is leaving.]]

[[Shirahoshi]] is the Mermaid Princess of the [[Ryugu Kingdom]] on [[Fish-Man Island]] and is a supporting ally to Luffy and his [[Straw Hat Pirates|crew]] during the [[Fish-Man Island Arc]]. Shirahoshi and Luffy have a good relationship and have become very close friends. She greatly admires and adores Luffy, believing him to be an incredible person and fighter. Luffy actually finds Shirahoshi irritating from time to time, but cares for her a great deal, wishing to help her as best he can, and has come to like her a lot.

The two first met when Luffy accidentally stumbled into her private quarters in the [[Ryugu Palace]]. She mistook him for an assassin until he saved her from a flying axe thrown by [[Vander Decken IX]]. He finds out that she has been locked away because she is constantly harassed and attacked by Decken, who sought her hand in marriage. She warms up to Luffy and hides him from the palace guards before feeding him some of her food. Despite Luffy saying he does not like her, and occasionally showing his annoyance with her, he decides to take it upon himself to help her see the outside world, something she has always dreamed of doing, and will act as her personal bodyguard. The two spend most of their time exploring Fish-Man Island whilst having to deal with people's false assumption that Luffy had kidnapped Shirahoshi. After her [[Neptune|father]] is captured, Shirahoshi travels to the [[Gyoncorde Plaza]] and spectates Luffy's fight with the [[New Fish-Man Pirates]]. After he defeated [[Hody Jones]] the two said their goodbyes, with Shirahoshi in tears.

Throughout his stay on Fish-Man Island, Shirahoshi becomes extremely fond of Luffy, trusting her life to him completely and followed his lead when they left the palace together. Her trust in Luffy is extremely high as she chose to stay with him, after Decken showed up to attack her, when he reminded her that he cannot protect her if she runs away. Despite the name calling, Shirahoshi does not let it affect her friendship with Luffy in the slightest, still being incredibly kind to him as she believes he is a good person and knows he means well. She is very thankful for how much Luffy protects her from Decken and feels completely safe whenever he is around, finding him to be a great source of comfort despite her timid nature. When her father was about to be executed by Hody Jones, she cried out for Luffy to save him and was relieved when he did so. When she was being kidnapped by [[Caribou]], she cried for Luffy's help and tearfully held onto him after he quickly defeated her would be kidnapper, thanking the Straw Hat captain.

She becomes very grateful to Luffy after he takes her to explore the outside world and to see her [[Otohime|mother]]'s grave. She finds his abilities to be amazing and marvels at how strong he is, commenting that he is incredible after he used [[Haki/Haoshoku Haki|Haoshoku Haki]] to knock out 50,000 of Hody Jones' crew members. She is very worried for his well-being and was anguishing over his fight against Hody, and again when he was trying to destroy the [[Noah]] to stop it from crashing onto Fish-Man Island, as it was causing him to lose too much blood. She was in tears as Luffy was dying in her hands, carrying him all the way back to Gyoncorde Plaza so he can be saved, and desperately offered up her own blood for him even though it was not the right type and in spite of the law preventing [[Fish-Men|fish-men]] or [[merfolk]] from sharing blood with [[humans]]. When Luffy was ready to leave Fish-Man Island she became distraught and tearfully swam after him to ask if he would one day return and take her to see a real forest on the surface world. She became overjoyed when he promises her that he will and holds onto that promise as a source of comfort.

Luffy is kind to Shirahoshi whilst also giving her a lot of tough love. He casually insults her habit of crying all the time as a means to build her character, believing her to be too soft from being pampered all her life. Nonetheless, he is more than willing to protect her from Decken and act as her personal bodyguard throughout his time on Fish-Man Island. When [[Jinbe]] panicked that Shirahoshi was out of the palace Luffy reassured him that she will be fine because he will protect her. He does not take kindly to people trying to hurt her and beat Decken senseless once he managed to get a hold of him. When Hody Jones went after the Mermaid Princess he attacked him, and did so again when Caribou tried to do the same. Despite his genuine concern, he does show his irritation with her from time to time, as despite being very grateful when she let him eat her food when they first met, he was annoyed when she poked his cheek, causing him to lash out. Upon discovering the burden Shirahoshi has had to carry to protect her mother's dying wish, he complimented her and acknowledge that she is not as weak as he initially thought. By the end of the Fish-Man Island arc, he has come to genuinely care for Shirahoshi and talked with her whilst sat in her palms before saying goodbye. Whilst leaving, he made a promise to her that he would come back to Fish-Man Island to take her to the surface world to see a real forest.

Since Luffy and his crew left Fish-Man Island, Shirahoshi has been keeping up with him and his adventures, using the news of him as a means to build her confidence to one day go to the surface world. She initially refused to attend the [[Levely]] with her family, as she wanted her first trip to the surface world to be with Luffy, stating that he promised her he would do so. However, after hearing about his exploits in [[Totto Land]] she decides to go with her family to the Levely as she does not want Luffy to call her weak again. Shirahoshi also met [[Vice-Admiral]] [[Monkey D. Garp|Garp]] whilst attending the Levely and enjoyed being in his company because he is Luffy's grandfather. She often refers to him as "Luffy's Grandfather-sama". Whilst at the Levely, she befriended both [[Rebecca]] and [[Nefertari Vivi|Vivi]] because of their shared admiration for Luffy. She affectionately calls the Straw Hat captain, "Luffy-sama".

===Camie===
[[File:Luffy And Camie.png|thumb|220px|Luffy and Camie on the Thousand Sunny.]]

[[Camie]] is a [[mermaid]] who is friends with [[Hatchan]] and befriended the [[Straw Hat Pirates]] at the beginning of the [[Sabaody Archipelago Arc]]. She befriended Luffy and his crew as soon as she met them and was an ally to them throughout the Sabaody Archipelago arc and the [[Fish-Man Island Arc]]. They reunited again two years later on [[Fish-Man Island]] and were very happy to see each other. Luffy likes Camie and gets on with her very well and has saved her numerous times. Camie admires Luffy for his sincere personality and abilities as a fighter.

The two first met when she landed on the Straw Hats' [[Thousand Sunny|ship]] after being swallowed by a [[sea king]]. She was able to make friends with Luffy and his crew very quickly and asked for his aid in saving her friend. Upon discovering her friend was Hatchan, a former enemy, Luffy refused but ended up doing so after [[Nami]] wanted to save him. She traveled with Luffy and his crew to [[Sabaody Archipelago]] where she was captured and was about to be sold off at the [[Human Auction House]] before Luffy arrived to save her. After the Straw Hats were separated she returned to Fish-Man Island. Two years later she reunited with her old friends on Fish-Man Island and acted as a guide for them and helped them throughout their time there.

Camie finds Luffy to be incredibly kind and friendly, warming up to him immediately and does her best to aid and protect Luffy as best she can. When Luffy and his crew arrived on Fish-Man Island she saved Luffy from drowning and took him and the others back to her dorm. She protected Luffy and his crew when a royal gondola was approaching their position, telling them to hide, as they had accidentally entered Fish-Man Island illegally. She is amazed by Luffy's strength and abilities and was happy when he agreed to save her friend, Hatchan. Whilst she was being held captive she was relieved to see Luffy had arrived to save her. She was greatly worried for Luffy and his crew's safety after they had been gone for almost a full day since they were separated on Sabaody. Camie is often shocked by Luffy's actions, as she was left stunned, and panicked, after Luffy punched a [[World Noble]]. She was shocked when she saw that Luffy was with Princess [[Shirahoshi]]. However, she is not all fazed by Luffy's bluntness as she was willing to answer his question about whether she can poop or not.

Luffy found Camie interesting due to her being a mermaid and got on with her immediately. He was greatly excited by her offer of [[takoyaki]] but was disappointed when she charged money for them. He has become fond of her and is willing to protect her when she is in danger. He saved her when she was captured by the [[Flying Fish Riders]] and crashed into the Human Auction House in order to save her from being sold, being relieved he had finally found her. When he met her again on Fish-Man Island he was very excited to see her again and thanked her for saving him. Luffy is impressed with Camie's abilities and was amazed that she could not only summon fishes, but talk to them as well. He also watched in awe as she saved his crew mate, [[Sanji]].

==Dressrosa==
[[File:Heroes of Dressrosa.png|thumb|left|220px|Citizens of Dressrosa building a statue of Luffy.]]

[[Dressrosa]] is a kingdom in the [[New World]] currently ruled by [[Riku Doldo III|King Riku Doldo III]] and formerly ruled by [[Donquixote Doflamingo]] and the [[Donquixote Pirates]]. Luffy arrived on the island, through his alliance with [[Trafalgar D. Water Law|Trafalgar Law]], with the intent of disrupting Doflamingo's operations there but ended up taking down the [[Shichibukai]] himself. The people of Dressrosa have come to adore Luffy as a hero for liberating them from Doflamingo's rule and ending [[Sugar]]'s [[Hobi Hobi no Mi|Devil Fruit]] powers over their loved ones. Luffy defeated Doflamingo in order to save the citizens of Dressrosa after he was informed about his cruel tyranny over the island by [[Rebecca]], promising the princess he would defeat him for her.

Following on from [[Punk Hazard]], Luffy and his crew, under the guidance of Law, headed to Dressrosa to begin operations to disrupt Doflamingo's partnership with the [[Four Emperors|emperor]], [[Kaidou]], with the goal of goading Kaidou into attacking Doflamingo. When he arrived, he discovered that his late [[Portgas D. Ace|brother]]'s [[Devil Fruit]], the [[Mera Mera no Mi]], was up for grabs in a local gladiatorial game. It was here that he first made his impression to the people of Dressrosa. After leaving the [[Corrida Colosseum]], he went directly after Doflamingo. During his fight with the Shichibukai, the people of Dressrosa began to cheer him on under the guidance of King Riku and [[Gatz]]. Following his victory, the people of Dressrosa celebrated and decided to help Luffy escape [[Admiral]] [[Issho|Fujitora]] under the guise of chasing him out of their kingdom.

The people of Dressrosa have a lot of faith in Luffy and believed he would save them from Doflamingo. Following the bounty revelation by Doflamingo for Luffy and his crew, the citizens contemplated trying to capture the Straw Hat captain and hand him over for their own sake, but ultimately chose not to do so and followed King Riku's advice to believe in Luffy instead. When King Riku informed the rest of the citizens, via speaker, that Luffy was the one fighting Doflamingo, they all gained a sense of hope after despairing at the thought of Doflamingo's [[Ito Ito no Mi|Birdcage]] killing them. [[Gatz]], the announcer of the [[Corrida Colosseum]], played a major role in Luffy being recognized as a hero of Dressrosa and rallied the support of the people in his favor as they all cheered him on throughout his grueling battle.

They are often impressed by Luffy's abilities. When they first witnessed Luffy, under his gladiatorial name "Lucy", they were amazed by his performances in the colosseum and were stunned when they saw Doflamingo crash land in the town centre, from the Royal Palace, after being punched by Luffy. However, they were rather confused by his [[Gomu Gomu no Mi/Gear 4 Techniques|Gear 4]] appearance and did not initially believe it was actually the Straw Hat captain and even asked him if he was really Luffy. They watched in amazement whilst Luffy fought against Doflamingo in the sky of Dressrosa and were overjoyed when Gatz finally announced Luffy as the winner. After Luffy's victory, they wished to return a favor to him by covering his escape under the false pretense that they hated him and were chasing him out of town, preventing Admiral Fujitora launching his attack. In his honor, they built a statue of Luffy as the gladiator "Lucy", alongside [[Usopp]], [[Kyros]] and [[Mont Blanc Noland]].

Luffy seemed to initially dislike Dressrosa, whilst it was under Doflamingo's reign, and compared the kingdom unfavorably to his home kingdom, [[Goa Kingdom]], as it is plagued with major class segregation and discrimination. He also described the island all together as "rough". Nonetheless, he came to empathize with the people of there after Rebecca informed him of the nature of Doflamingo's rule, and later found out what he has been doing to the citizens throughout his ten year reign, such as turning them into toys and robbing people's memories of their loved ones. Although he promised to defeat Doflamingo specifically for Rebecca, he did so with the wish to save all of Dressrosa as well. Despite saving them, he does not care for their approval as when he had taken Rebecca from the castle he was not at all concerned that some of the citizenry believed he had kidnapped her. Throughout his time in Dressrosa, Luffy managed to befriend numerous people besides Rebecca, such as [[Viola]], who aided him in his infiltration of the Royal Palace. King Riku and Gatz, who both played vital roles in swaying the public's opinion of him in his favor, and at one point was saved by the latter. He befriended Kyros, a legendary fighter of the colosseum and became a crucial ally in defeating Doflamingo. It was also whilst he was on Dressrosa that he met numerous fighters within the Corrida Colosseum that would come to make up the [[Straw Hat Grand Fleet]].

===Rebecca===
[[File:Luffy Meets Rebecca.png|thumb|220px|Luffy and Rebecca look at the statue of Kyros.]]

[[Rebecca]] is the former Crown Princess of [[Dressrosa]], a former gladiatorial combatant, the daughter of [[Kyros]], and an ally during the [[Dressrosa Arc]]. She and Luffy share a very close friendship and deeply care for each other. Rebecca was initially concerned about Luffy being an obstacle to her ultimate goal of defeating [[Donquixote Doflamingo|Doflamingo]], but was reassured to find out he shared this goal as well. She is frequently awestruck by Luffy's abilities and comes to rely on him heavily throughout the Dressrosa arc. Luffy respects her determination to save the people of [[Dressrosa]], doing his best to protect her, and promises to defeat Doflamingo for her.

The two first met in the [[Corrida Colosseum]], during the gladiatorial games, when Rebecca went up to Luffy and thanked him for defeating [[Spartan]] earlier, who had regularly bullied her. She talks to him about the statue of [[Kyros]] that he was admiring and informed him of the legend behind it, intriguing him. Despite the immediate positive impression she got off Luffy, she became wary of him because of the immense power he showed during his match, which led her to try and kill him so she could be the one to win the [[Mera Mera no Mi]]. Luffy was able to overpower and subdue her, however, and listened to her explain why she tried to kill him. Upon finding out her desires to defeat Doflamingo the two came to a mutual understanding and became friends. From then on, she acted as an ally to Luffy and played a role in helping him free [[Trafalgar D. Water Law|Trafalgar Law]] and taking on a member of the [[Donquixote Pirates]] before watching Luffy finally defeat Doflamingo. After Luffy reunited her with her father, she watched as he escaped [[Admiral]] [[Issho|Fujitora]] and leave Dressrosa.

Rebecca is very reliant on Luffy whilst also finding him interesting and inspirational. When they first met she liked him quickly because of the shared admiration he had for the statue of Kyros. She was happy to discover they were not in the same group for their matches and hoped that they would both make it out of their respective rounds. She was amused, and intrigued, when Luffy was able to tame the [[Fighting Bull]] of the Colosseum, commenting that he is interesting. She was confused, and also stunned, by Luffy forgiving her despite her attempt to assassinate him, having been willing to accept any punishment. This kindness convinced her to confide in Luffy about her desires to stop Doflamingo and save Dressrosa. She was hesitant about Luffy's claim that he would defeat Doflamingo, but after being reassured by him, her faith became cemented. When she was being forced to strike down her own aunt, [[Viola]], she cries out for Luffy and becomes inconsolable when he turns up just in time to save them both.

She is amazed by Luffy's abilities as a fighter, but nonetheless still worries for him. She was surprised when Luffy was able to defeat [[Hajrudin]] in only one hit, and was further amazed when he unleashed his [[Haki/Haoshoku Haki|Haoshoku Haki]] whilst clashing with [[Chinjao]]. She watched in awe as he fought Doflamingo in his [[Gomu Gomu no Mi/Gear 4 Techniques|Gear 4]] form and cheered him on as much as she could whilst also being worried for his well-being throughout the fight. She was amazed by Luffy's victory against the Shichibukai and cries profusely over him for fulfilling the promise he had made to her. She cared for Luffy after he passed out and rested his head on her lap until his [[Straw Hat Pirates|crew]] arrived to take him away. She was disappointed when she thought she would not get to say goodbye to Luffy but was overjoyed when he arrived at the palace and took her to see her father. When Luffy was trying to escape Dressrosa whilst Fujitora pursued him she was worried, but was relieved to see he managed to escape.

Luffy likes Rebecca a lot and respects her determination to liberate Dressrosa and become stronger for the sake of achieving that dream. He cheered her on during her match and became extremely angry with the crowd for booing her so viciously. He asked [[Nico Robin|Robin]] if Rebecca was doing okay and was happy to hear her over the [[Den Den Mushi]]. He decided to inform Rebecca that the [[Kyros|Thunder Soldier]], who had raised her, is actually her father, Kyros, causing her to cry at the revelation. He quickly comforted her, promising that he would defeat Doflamingo for her, and to stay with his friends. He later thanked Rebecca for getting him the key to Trafalgar Law's [[seastone]] cuffs. When she questioned him if he could really defeat Doflamingo, whilst still calling him "Lucy", he reminded her of his actual name and reassured her that he would defeat him because he is going to become the [[Pirate King]]. Before leaving Dressrosa, he made sure that Rebecca was reunited with her father, knowing that is what she truly wants, and carried her to his house whilst being chased by the [[Marines]].

Since Dressrosa, Rebecca has become an admirer of Luffy and takes great pleasure reading about his exploits in [[Totto Land]]. She seeks to talk about him at every opportunity and got to do so with [[Koby]], and later [[Nefertari Vivi|Vivi]], [[Shirahoshi]] and [[Sai]], whilst at the [[Levely]]. Rebecca has the habit of calling Luffy by his gladiatorial cover name, "Lucy", despite having been corrected numerous times.

===Viola===
[[File:Viola Tells Luffy To Be Quiet.png|thumb|left|220px|Viola telling Luffy to be quiet whilst infiltrating the Royal Palace.]]

[[Viola]] is the current Crown Princess of [[Dressrosa]], the aunt of [[Rebecca]], and a former member of the [[Donquixote Pirates]]. She aided Luffy and his [[Straw Hat Pirates|crew]] throughout the [[Dressrosa Arc]], having initially been their enemy. Despite being initially hesitant about him, she grew to like Luffy and has become eternally grateful to him for defeating [[Donquixote Doflamingo|Doflamingo]]. Luffy did not interact with Viola very often but was thankful for her aid throughout the Dressrosa arc and protected her at numerous points.

In Dressrosa, She first met [[Sanji]] and was intent on killing him, as she was a member of the Donquixote Pirates, but was won over by him and was convinced to aid him and his [[Straw Hat Pirates|crew]]. Later she came across Luffy and decided to help him by sneaking into Dressrosa's Royal Palace and help him get all the way to Doflamingo's location. She continued to aid Luffy and his crew as best she could throughout the arc. After being saved by Luffy and [[Trafalgar D. Water Law|Trafalgar Law]], She watched on in amazement as Luffy fought Doflamingo and was overjoyed when he finally defeated the [[Shichibukai]].

Viola was stunned by Luffy's audacious and reckless nature, but was won over by his sincerity to help save her kingdom from Doflamingo. As a result, she faithfully aided the Straw Hat captain, working alongside him during his initial confrontation with Doflamingo and his family, and convinced her father, [[Riku Doldo III|King Riku]], to believe in Luffy and the Straw Hats. Viola is often shocked by Luffy's actions, such as blowing their group's cover by recklessly smashing an entrance whilst infiltrating the Royal Palace. She was relieved by his late intervention when Rebecca was being [[Ito Ito no Mi|controlled]] by Doflamingo to kill her and watched in awe as Luffy fought Doflamingo. When Luffy had finally defeated him she could not help but cry whilst looking up at the Straw Hat captain, thanking him. She appreciates Luffy's friendship with her niece, Rebecca, and was ultimately happy to see him take her back to be reunited with her father, [[Kyros]].

Luffy became immediately friendly with Viola and trusted her to take him, [[Kin'emon]] and [[Roronoa Zoro|Zoro]] to Doflamingo. He was thankful for the aid she gave him when infiltrating the Royal Palace, and praised her when she gave him the key to free [[Trafalgar D. Water Law|Trafalgar Law]] from his [[Seastone]] cuffs. He tried to protect her from [[Gladius]] and carried her when she was injured. Later on, he came to her aid again when she was captured by Doflamingo and was about to be struck down by Rebecca, with the help of Law, he switched his position with hers and took the brunt of the attack from Rebecca.

===Kyros===
[[File:Luffy Eating At Kyros' House.png|thumb|220px|Luffy and Kyros whilst eating inside the latter's house.]]

[[Kyros]] is the legendary champion of the [[Corrida Colosseum]], the father of Princess [[Rebecca]] and an ally to Luffy during the [[Dressrosa Arc]]. The two get on pretty well when they first meet and he is extremely thankful for what Luffy did for him, Rebecca and [[Dressrosa]], having played a crucial role in [[Donquixote Doflamingo|Doflamingo]]'s demise. Luffy admires Kyros as a great warrior and for his aid in taking down Doflamingo.

Luffy met Kyros when he entered Dressrosa whilst he was still a toy known as the "Thunder Soldier" and found him to be hilarious. He later came across Kyros' statue inside the Corrida Colosseum and was told about the legend of Kyros by Rebecca, who did not know she was his daughter due to the effects of [[Sugar]]'s [[Hobi Hobi no Mi|Devil Fruit]]. They would cross paths once more when Luffy saved him from an attack by Gladius and from then on he worked with him to take down Doflamingo.

Kyros finds Luffy to be a great fighter and wished to aid him as best he could. He was pleased to know he was on his side after realizing he is a [[pirate]], having no issues with him being a criminal as he is also one.{{qref|chap=742}} He found him to be a useful ally and was grateful that his friend, and crew mate, [[Usopp]], was the one to dispel Sugar's Devil Fruit effects on him that allowed him to become human again. When he was riding with Luffy and [[Cavendish]] on [[Farul]] he was briefly annoyed that Luffy did not stop Rebecca getting into enemy territory but was reassured when Luffy told him she is with his friends. When Luffy defeated Doflamingo he cried profusely with great relief as his ten year suffering was finally over. After Luffy's victory he allowed him and his crew to use his home as shelter from the [[Marines]].{{qref|chap=794}} He was extremely thankful when Luffy brought his daughter to him so that they could be reunited once more and watched happily as Luffy escaped the Admiral [[Issho|Fujitora]] and the Marines.

Luffy admires Kyros and found the legend of his days as a gladiator interesting. He respects him not only for being a capable fighter but for protecting the ones he loves. At the beginning he found Kyros to be hilarious whilst he was in his Thunder Solider form, taking a great liking to him. He aids Kyros multiple times, having saved him from [[Gladius]] and from a lethal blow by Doflamingo. He was later relieved to meet him again when riding on Cavendish's horse. However, he was annoyed when Kyros declared he would be the one to defeat Doflamingo, getting into a short argument over it. After his victory he rested inside Kyros' house and was irritated with his decision not to stay with Rebecca, not buying his reasoning. This led to him taking Rebecca from the palace and bringing her to his house so they could be reunited and live together.{{qref|chap=797}}

===Gatz===
[[File:Gatz Helps Luffy.png|thumb|left|220px|Gatz helps Luffy.]]

[[Gatz]] is the announcer of the [[Corrida Colosseum]] in [[Dressrosa]] and was a huge supporting ally of Luffy throughout the [[Dressrosa Arc]]. He is a major fan of Luffy and is constantly left in awe at his power and abilities, and sees Luffy as a huge inspiration and the savior of Dressrosa. Luffy himself scarcely acknowledged Gatz due to how little they interacted, however, he was thankful after he offered his aid and got him to safety from [[Donquixote Doflamingo|Doflamingo]] when he needed to rest.

Luffy, disguised as "Lucy", fought in the gladiatorial games and Gatz became an immediate fan of his. He watched with great enthusiasm as he fought the varying opponents in his match, and was happy to declare him the winner of the round. He would not meet Luffy again until he found the Straw Hat captain exhausted from his use of [[Gomu Gomu no Mi/Gear 4 Techniques|Gear 4]] and choose to carry him to safety whilst being pursued by [[Jesus Burgess|Burgess]] and Doflamingo. He witnessed Luffy finally defeat Doflamingo and was left in tears of joy.

From the moment he met him, Gatz adored Luffy and was constantly left in awe at his feats. He was greatly disappointed when he fought Luffy had been defeated by [[Hajrudin]] but was stunned to see him not only get back up without any injuries, but proceed to one punch the [[giant]]. He was amazed when Luffy clashed his [[Haki/Haoshoku Haki|Haoshoku Haki]] with [[Chinjao]] that knocked out every other opponent in the ring as well as half of the audience. He was determined to aid Luffy, at the risk of his own life, when Luffy had exhausted his [[Haki]] reservoir from using Gear 4. He played a crucial role in having the people of Dressrosa support Luffy in his fight against Doflamingo, commentating over his fight. At one point Doflamingo attacked Gatz because of his support for Luffy. He still continued to support the Straw Hat captain however, and cried with joy when Luffy had finally won, announcing the results to the people of Dressrosa. He remained supportive of Luffy even when he "kidnapped" [[Rebecca]] and was happy to hear he had reunited her with her father, [[Kyros]]. He discovered Luffy was "Lucy" in the gladiatorial games early on but still refers to him as "Lucy" alongside most of the people of Dressrosa.

Luffy did not interact with Gatz very often, but was nonetheless extremely grateful to him for saving him from Doflamingo when he had ran out of Haki. He felt comfortable enough to tell Gatz that he had swapped places with [[Sabo]] during the gladiatorial games, which is against the rule, but Gatz let it slide as he understood that the [[Mera Mera no Mi]] is very important to Luffy. He promised Gatz that if he buys him ten minutes he would defeat Doflamingo with one more punch and free him and everybody else, inspiring the announcer to aid him.

==Mokomo Dukedom==
[[File:Luffy Parties With Mink Tribe.png|thumb|220px|Luffy and his crew enjoys partying with members of Mink tribe.]]

The [[Mink Tribe|Mink tribe]] are a race of animal-like people that dominantly live on [[Zou]]. Luffy first met a Mink, [[Bepo]], all the way back on [[Sabaody Archipelago]] who is part of the [[Heart Pirates]], he then came across [[Pekoms]] on [[Fish-Man Island]] who is a member of the [[Big Mom Pirates]] and met the Mink tribe once he arrived on Zou. The Minks have great respect for Luffy and his [[Straw Hat Pirates|crew]] for aiding them both directly and in-directly. Luffy, himself, admires the Mink tribe for their strength and toughness, being greatly impressed by a lot of the Minks he has met.

On [[Dressrosa]], Luffy allowed [[Sanji]], along with [[Nami]], [[Brook]] and [[Tony Tony Chopper|Chopper]], to leave the kingdom and go on ahead to Zou as they were being pursued by the Big Mom Pirates. Sanji's group arrived on Zou and immediately aided the Minks after they had been brutalized by [[Jack]], an All-Star of the [[Beasts Pirates]]. Soon after, Luffy's group arrived on Zou and was warmly welcomed by the Minks for what his crew members did for them and for defeating [[Donquixote Doflamingo|Doflamingo]] which forced Jack to leave Zou. Whilst there, after discovering their dedication to the [[Kouzuki Family]], he formed an alliance with the Mink Tribe with the expressed goal of defeating the [[Four Emperors|emperor]], [[Kaidou]].

The Minks are very fond of Luffy and his crew and held banquets for them. Apart from [[Pedro]], the leader of the [[Guardians]], having mistaken Luffy as a threat, they have shown complete kindness and courtesy to him and his crew. They are extremely grateful for Luffy defeating the [[Shichibukai]], Doflamingo, as it forced Jack to abandon his rampage on Zou, saving their lives. They were more than happy to allow Luffy and his crew mate, [[Robin]], to inspect the [[Road Poneglyph]] in their [[Mokomo Dukedom|kingdom]]. Through their allegiance with the Kouzuki Family, the Minks were happy to form an alliance with Luffy and his crew, recognizing them as capable and powerful individuals. The leaders of the Mink Tribe wished to aid Luffy and his crew when they planned to rescue Sanji and did so by allowing Pedro to join Luffy's group as he would be able to keep Pekoms in line throughout their time on [[Totto Land]].

Luffy is respectful of the Mink Tribe and admires how tough they all are, having survived the onslaught of the Beast Pirates, led by Jack, for five days. He was impressed when Pedro and the Guardians had surrounded him and he had no idea despite his proficiency with [[Haki/Kenbunshoku Haki|Kenbunshoku Haki]]. He was stunned when it was revealed that they had protected the location of [[Raizo]], the [[ninja]] of the Kouzuki Family, from Jack and his crew, having originally been under the impression that there was bad blood between them and the Kouzuki Family. He was grateful to the Minks for their hospitality and parties that they held for them, and was thankful that they allowed Pedro and Pekoms to join him on his mission to recover Sanji.

Whilst on Zou he has made numerous friends, such as [[Wanda]] who was the first Mink he met, alongside [[Carrot]], who saved him from his fight with the Guardians. He was able to make friends with the two leaders of the Mink Tribe, [[Inuarashi]] and [[Nekomamushi]], both of whom acknowledge Luffy as a serious candidate to become the next [[Pirate#Pirate King|Pirate King]]. He found Inuarashi to be impressive and complimented his strength, whilst Inuarashi took a great interest in Luffy, especially as he was in possession of the [[Straw Hat|straw hat]] [[Shanks]] used to wear. Nekomamushi was eager to meet Luffy, as well as [[Roronoa Zoro|Zoro]], and decided to have a party with Luffy and his crew. Just like his counter-part, he took an interest in Luffy because of his straw hat. He also made two close allies, and friends, in Pedro and Carrot who journeyed with him to Totto Land.

===Carrot===
[[File:Carrot And Luffy.png|thumb|left|220px|Carrot typically rubbing her cheek against Luffy's.]]

[[Carrot]] is a member of the [[Mink Tribe|Mink tribe]] and an ally of Luffy and the [[Straw Hats]]. Luffy and Carrot get on very well and have developed a strong friendship with each other. She has allied with the Straw Hats since the [[Zou Arc]] and has sailed with them all the way to [[Wano Country]]. Carrot is pretty fond of Luffy and believes him to be a great person and captain. She also has admiration for his determination and fighting abilities. Luffy has come to care for Carrot and treats her like a member of his crew, becoming furious when someone tries to hurt her.

After entering Zou, Luffy found himself in a fight with [[Roddy]] until Carrot intervened and calmed Roddy down. She then introduced herself to Luffy and rode with him and [[Wanda]] to Right Belly Fortress. Once Luffy had discovered what had happened to [[Sanji]], he announced his intention to infiltrate [[Charlotte Linlin|Big Mom]]'s [[Totto Land|territory]] to recover him, which excited Carrot. This led her to sneak aboard the [[Thousand Sunny]] to travel with Luffy and the Sanji Retrieval Team to Totto Land. She worked with Luffy and his crew to get Sanji back and escape Big Mom's territory, eventually arriving in Wano and work with Luffy and his crew to remove the [[Beasts Pirates]].

Carrot is very fond of Luffy and tends to joyfully nibble on his face a lot. She also gives him "garchu", which involves her rubbing her cheek against him, and is the Mink Tribe's way of greeting or thanking someone. She cares for him deeply and was distraught when he had been [[poison]]ed after eating the Armored Stonefish. She was extremely happy when he made a recovery and affectionately nibbled on him again. She was concerned for Luffy during his fight against [[Charlotte Katakuri]] and was overjoyed to see he had not only survived, but had won, rubbing her cheek against him. When she reunited with him at Oden's Castle, on Wano, she immediately hugged him. Despite her obvious fondness for him, she is capable of being violent towards Luffy, as she aggressively attacked him and bit into his neck when she saw him eating her carrot and had to be patted on the head by him to stop.

Luffy has become quite fond of Carrot and was more than happy to let her join him and the Sanji Retrieval Team when it was revealed she had hidden away on the ship. He tolerates her habit of nibbling on his cheek but finds it annoying at times. When she was subdued by Katakuri he became angry and attacked the Sweet Commander, successfully managing to hold him off so she could get away. He treats her almost like a member of his crew and trusts her, along with the others, to take care of the Thousand Sunny before he leaves to fight Katakuri.

===Pedro===
[[File:Pedro Meets Luffy.png|thumb|220px|Pedro rubbing his cheek with Luffy when they first properly meet.]]

[[Pedro]] was a member of the [[Mink Tribe|Mink tribe]], the captain of the [[Guardians]], the former captain of the [[Nox Pirates]], and an ally to Luffy and the [[Straw Hat Pirates|Straw Hats]] during the [[Whole Cake Island Arc]] as a member of the Sanji Retrieval Team. Despite initially thinking he was an enemy, Pedro quickly became friends with Luffy and respected him as the [[Pirate Captain|captain]] of his crew. Luffy was very friendly with Pedro and was impressed with his fighting abilities.

The two met on [[Zou]] when Pedro initially believed that Luffy was an enemy after he entered the Whale Forest illegally, but backed off once [[Wanda]] told him who he was. He later apologized to Luffy and wished to join the Sanji Retrieval Team to save [[Sanji]], who had previously saved him and the Mink tribe after [[Jack]]'s assault on Zou. He aided Luffy throughout their time on Whole Cake Island and eventually sacrificed himself to nullify [[Charlotte Perospero|Perospero]]'s [[Pero Pero no Mi|Devil Fruit]] abilities on the [[Thousand Sunny]], allowing the Sanji Retrieval Team to set sail and escape.

Pedro was very loyal to Luffy and respected him as the captain of the Straw Hats. His loyalty was shown when he chose not to dispute some of Luffy's decisions, such as when Luffy allowed [[Carrot]] to join the Sanji Retrieval Team despite his protest and his protectiveness of her. His loyalty is reflected again when the crew landed on [[Cacao Island]] and he held [[Charlotte Pudding]], a member of the Big Mom Pirates, at the edge of his sword before asking Luffy what he wished to do with her. Another part of his loyalty is his fierce determination to protect him, as he was more than prepared to fight [[Vinsmoke Yonji]], who refused to give an antidote to Luffy after he was [[poison]]ed from eating the Armored Stonefish, but was stopped by [[Vinsmoke Reiju]] who cured Luffy. When Luffy was being apprehended by the police force on [[Cacao Island]], Pedro readied his sword to save him but Pudding stepped in before he could do anything. After Luffy had been immobilized by [[Charlotte Katakuri]], he was more than ready to help him but [[Jinbe]] intervened first, and when the Sweet Commander went after Luffy again he tried to hold him off. He chose to make the ultimate sacrifice for Luffy's sake so he and his crew could set sail off [[Whole Cake Island]]. Pedro wished to aid Luffy as best he could and would feel guilty if he had inadvertently burdened him. An example of this is when he apologized to Luffy for having to take [[Brook]] to steal the [[Poneglyph#Road Poneglyph|Road Poneglyph]], as he intended to do this task on his own. He had noted the similarities between Luffy and [[Gol D. Roger]], who he met as a child, after Luffy was able to hear [[Zunesha]]'s voice but could not respond to it. It was his brief interaction with Gol D. Roger that made him believe how important Luffy and his crew are in bringing about a new age, which encouraged him to give up his own life for them.

Luffy has huge respect for Pedro for what he did for him and his crew, and thought of him as a really impressive fighter. He was amazed by Pedro's ability to mask his presence, along with the rest of the Guardians, when he first met him, despite his own proficiency in [[Haki/Kenbunshoku Haki|Kenbunshoku Haki]]. Later on, he was more than happy to accept his apology and agreed to have him join the Sanji Retrieval Team. When they arrived in [[Totto Land]], he trusted him with the task of retrieving the Road Poneglyphs from [[Charlotte Linlin|Big Mom]], which is a crucial job for Luffy's dream to become the [[Pirate#Pirate King|Pirate King]].

When Pedro sacrificed himself for Luffy and his crew so they could escape the [[Big Mom Pirates]], Luffy was devastated at the loss of a friend, but quickly regained his composure and told [[Nami]] to set sail. He understood what Pedro had done for him and his crew, as he remarked that if they failed to escape they could never face Pedro again. Luffy has great appreciation for Pedro's efforts and acknowledged him as a valuable ally throughout their quest to save Sanji. Luffy would continue to remember and honor Pedro's sacrifice long after his death; during his battle with [[Kaidou]], while gaining his second wind while using [[Gomu Gomu no Mi/Gear 5 Techniques|Gear 5]], he recited a list of people who he was continuing to fight for ([[Kouzuki Momonosuke|Momonosuke]], [[Tama]] and [[Kin'emon]]), saving Pedro's name for last.

==Wano Country==
{{cquote|We came here to defeat Kaidou. Those who would be allies should not get in the way. That's why decide right now. Will you join us or side with Kaidou!?|Luffy to his fellow Udon Prisoners{{Qref|chap=949}}}}
[[File:Wano Citizens Thank Luffy.png|thumb|left|220px|Citizens of Okobore Town thank Luffy for the food.]]

[[Wano Country]] is a country in the [[New World]] ruled by the [[Kouzuki Family]] and formerly by the [[emperor]], [[Kaidou]] and Shogun, [[Orochi]]. The citizens are isolated from the outside world and thus are not aware who Luffy is. Some of the Wano citizens were initially hesitant to support Luffy in his endeavor against Kaidou, but were won over by him and became allies. Wano had a class divide, with the poorest dealing with famine due to food hoarding by the wealthy class and the pollution of Wano's natural environment. Luffy's victory over Kaidou, and the re-establishment of the Kouzuki line under [[Momonosuke]], allowed for these issues to be dealt with.

When Luffy arrived on Wano he met a young girl named [[Tama]] who took him to her home. Here he discovered that she suffered from starvation and had become sick from drinking the polluted water.{{Qref|chap=911|page=10-14, 17|ep=893|ep2=894}} Once getting her some aid, he learned from [[Hitetsu]]{{Qref|chap=912|page=6-7|ep=894}} and [[Tsuru]]{{Qref|chap=914|page=9-11|ep=900}} about the cruel reality for the people of Wano and how they suffer under Kaidou and Orochi's rule. Luffy was later imprisoned in Udon's Mines{{Qref|chap=924|page=14|ep=916}} and met more citizens of Wano who had become political prisoners of Orochi. He won them over as allies{{Qref|chap=949|page=16}} and formed a capable alliance to successfully remove Kaidou and Orochi.

The citizens of Wano, as a whole, are oblivious to who Luffy actually is, as Kaidou went to great lengths to limit the information from outside Wano's boarders. As such, they were shocked to hear this apparent nobody had attacked Kaidou, but were unsurprised that he had lost.{{Qref|chap=924|page=3, 11|ep=893|ep2=894}} Some citizens, such as the people of [[Okobore Town]], came to see Luffy as a hero after he stole food for them to eat after starving for so long.{{Qref|chap=918|page=13-14|ep=908}} He further won more admirers in Udon Prison after he stood up to the [[Beasts Pirates]] and protected [[Hyougoro]] from [[Daifugo]].{{Qref|chap=926|page=17|ep=919}} Nonetheless, their fear of Kaidou prevented them from following Luffy initially, and they even tried to stop his rampage in Udon Prison because of it, despite admiring his bravery to rebel.{{Qref|chap=948|page=4-5}} This soon changed after Luffy purposefully infected himself with the Mummy Virus and gave them an impassioned speech that motivated them to aid his efforts to subdue [[Babanuki]] and fight for their freedom.{{Qref|chap=949|page=13-18}} Their support for Luffy was cemented after [[Kouzuki Oden|Oden]]'s son, [[Momonosuke]], vouched for him as his friend, despite being a [[pirate]].{{Qref|chap=950|page=8}}

Initially, Luffy had only intended to free Wano from Kaidou for the Kouzuki Family, but his friendship with Tama and seeing the harsh reality for the citizens there convinced him to fight on their behalf too. Luffy even went as far as to steal fresh food for the citizens of Okobore Town. In Udon Prison, he was annoyed by some of the imprisoned citizens' submissiveness towards Kaidou and their lack of desire to fight for their own freedom. He berated them all whilst in Udon Prison for this and informed them of his promise to Tama, that he understood the cruelty of Oden's execution, and Kaidou destroying the prosperity of Wano. He openly declared to all of them that he will remove Kaidou for them and demanded that they follow him if they want their freedom back. Luffy has ultimately become a source of inspiration for them and managed to win their full support during his battle to free Wano. Following their victory, he gave great praise to those party to the events in the [[Raid on Onigashima]], but ultimately wished not to be known to the wider public of Wano, due to his humility and so the people came to know him as [[Joy Boy]] and are eternally grateful to him for saving Wano.{{Qref|chap=1053|ep=1080}}

===Kouzuki Family===
[[File:Kouzuki Family Request an Alliance With Luffy.png|thumb|220px|The Kouzuki Family formally request an alliance with Luffy.]]

The [[Kouzuki Family]] are the current rulers of [[Wano Country]] that had been overthrown twenty years ago by the [[Four Emperors|emperor]], [[Kaidou]]. The remaining members of the family is [[Kouzuki Momonosuke|Momonosuke]], who is protected by numerous retainers loyal to his family, and [[Kouzuki Hiyori|Hiyori]]. Luffy has a good relationship with the Kouzuki Family and had Momonosuke, along with his retainers, join him on his journey in the [[New World]] from [[Punk Hazard]] up until their victory over Kaidou. The Kouzuki Family developed a sincere friendship with Luffy and his [[Straw Hat Pirates|crew]], having come to admire their strength and abilities. They provided helpful aid to Luffy during the [[Dressrosa Arc]] whilst Luffy returned the favor in the [[Wano Country Arc]].

Luffy first met a member of the Kouzuki Family, the retainer [[Kin'emon]], who originally had his body cut up by [[Trafalgar D. Water Law|Trafalgar Law]] and scattered across the island of Punk Hazard.{{Qref|chap=656|page=11|ep=580}} They later became allies and worked together to rescue the children of Punk Hazard and Momonosuke.{{Qref|chap=663|page=16-17|ep=588}} Luffy would be the one to find Momonosuke, in his dragon form from eating an [[Artificial Devil Fruit]], whilst inside a laboratory. After defeating [[Caesar Clown]] they headed to [[Dressrosa]] where the crew met another retainer of the family, [[Kurozumi Kanjuro|Kanjuro]]. Following the defeat of [[Donquixote Doflamingo|Doflamingo]], the crew travelled to [[Zou]] where they met a third retainer, [[Raizo]], and also met the [[Mink Tribe|Mink tribe]] who are loyal to the Kouzuki Family and are headed by two more Kouzuki retainers, [[Inuarashi]] and [[Nekomamushi]]. It was also on Zou that the Kouzuki Family formally created an [[Ninja-Pirate-Mink-Samurai Alliance|alliance]] with Luffy and his crew to defeat Kaidou. After sorting out the logistics, Luffy travelled to [[Totto Land]] to get [[Sanji]] back before arriving in Wano to reunite with the Kouzuki Family and begin operations to take down Kaidou and put the Kouzuki Family back in power. Whilst in Wano, Luffy met further members of the family, [[Kikunojo]], [[Shinobu]] and [[Kawamatsu]].

[[File:Luffy's Group Fights in Udon.png|thumb|left|220px|Luffy fights alongside members of the Kouzuki Family in Udon.]]

The Kouzuki Family respect and admire Luffy, with each member having been saved by him during their various adventures across the New World. They are respectful towards him and do not try to establish any authority despite the urgency of their quest. Each member has proven to be an incredibly helpful ally for Luffy and have played various key roles in defeating both Caesar Clown and Doflamingo. Kin'emon, who acts as the official lead representative of the family, even wished to aid Luffy in his retrieval of Sanji but regrettably needed to return to Wano to begin operations. They have all grown close to Luffy and admire him as a [[Pirate Captain|captain]] and fighter to such an extent that they formally requested that he ally with them to defeat Kaidou since their goals are aligned. Despite the high nobility of their family, each of them often get caught up in Luffy and his crew's shenanigans, having fun with him and enjoying his upbeat way of living. Kin'emon and Momonosuke, in particular, have gotten close to Luffy, with the latter almost looking up to him like an older brother. Their faith and support of Luffy was fully justified when Luffy successfully took down Kaidou and allowed the Kouzuki Family to return to power.{{Qref|chap=1049}}

Luffy does not particularly care that they are a high noble family from Wano and treats them simply as his friends. He likes each one of the family and believes them all to be good people. When it was revealed who Momonosuke was, Luffy was not at all fazed and still treated him like any other person, even outright refusing his request to bow. When it comes to Momonosuke, Luffy tries to help him understand his role as the leader of the Kouzuki Family and initially refused Kin'emon's request to ally with them unless Momonosuke was the one to ask him. Luffy becomes sympathetic with their situation and desires to help them reclaim what they have lost to Kaidou. He saved Momonosuke and Kin'emon on Punk Hazard, as well as Kanjuro on Dressrosa, and was more than happy to allow them to travel with him and his crew all the way to Wano. Whilst in Wano, he befriended Kikunojo and saved her from [[Urashima]], and freed Kawamatsu from Udon Prison. When he finally made it to the roof of the [[Skull Dome]] Luffy was upset to find the Kouzuki retainers all severely injured. He tended to Kine'mon, disregarding the presence of Kaidou and [[Big Mom]], and reassured him that he would save Wano because they are his friends.{{Qref|chap=1000}} Once he commanded [[Trafalgar D. Water Law]] to transport the retainers to safety he began his battle with Kaidou, a battle he eventually won.{{Qref|chap=1049}}

He also greatly appreciates the aid each member of the family has provided him with since he met them. He is comically fond of Raizo because he is a [[ninja]] and is amused at some of the tricks he can perform. Luffy has also come to deeply admire [[Kouzuki Oden|Oden]], the late head of the family who had done numerous good deeds to improve the welfare of Wano Citizens and was unjustly killed by Kaidou and [[Kurozumi Orochi]]. He was shocked to find out that he was Momonosuke's father and even more shocked to hear he was part of the [[Roger Pirates]]. Luffy has become greatly inspired by Oden and wishes to continue his legacy by removing Kaidou from power and restoring peace and prosperity to Wano. Due to his fondness for the Kouzuki Family, he was furious when Kanjuro betrayed the family, as well as him and his crew, and took Momonosuke captive.

====Kin'emon====
[[File:Kin'emon Laughing at Luffy's Antics.png|thumb|220px|Luffy entertains Kin'emon as they feast.]]

[[Kin'emon|Kin'emon]] is a retainer of the [[Kouzuki Family]] and the guardian of it's heir, [[Kouzuki Momonosuke|Momonosuke]]. He and Luffy first met on [[Punk Hazard]] and the two quickly became friends and allies. From the [[Punk Hazard Arc|Punk Hazard arc]], he had been on Luffy's [[Thousand Sunny|ship]] until they arrived in Wano, during that time they had grown close. They both share mutual respect for each other and both desired to remove [[Kaidou]] from [[Wano Country]] so the Kouzuki Family can return to power, a task they eventually succeeded in.

Whilst adventuring through Punk Hazard, Luffy came across a dragon and soon found Kin'emon's legs, separated from his body, attached to the dragon.{{Qref|chap=656|page=11|ep=580}} Luffy was able to remove them from the dragon before attaching them to himself.{{Qref|chap=657|page=2|ep=581}} Eventually, he came across the rest of Kin'emon's body and he was reassembled back to normal.{{Qref|chap=663|page=2|ep=588}} From there, they formed an alliance to rescue the captured children and find Momonosuke. After their success, they travelled together to [[Dressrosa]]{{Qref|chap=698|page=13|ep=624}} where Kin'emon aided Luffy's victory over [[Donquixote Doflamingo|Doflamingo]] after finding his friend, [[Kurozumi Kanjuro|Kanjuro]],{{Qref|chap=754|page=4-5|ep=691}} on the island. From there they visited [[Zou]] and the two formally entered an alliance to defeat Kaidou.{{Qref|chap=819|page=15|ep=772}} They reunited on Wano and began their operations to remove Kaidou from power{{Qref|chap=919|page=15|ep=909}} that concluded with Luffy's victory over the emperor.{{Qref|chap=1049}}

Although a high ranking member of the Kouzuki Family, Kin'emon is ultimately fond of Luffy's silly nature and gets on with him pretty well. Fundamentally, he sees Luffy as a great warrior and holds nothing but respect for him. Even the urgency of his quest to save Wano and restore the Kouzuki Family back to power does nothing to lessen his acknowledgement of Luffy's authority. Despite this, he can be shocked by his antics, such as recklessly storming Doflamingo's palace,{{Qref|chap=736|page=12-13|ep=668}} refusing his initial request for an alliance{{Qref|chap=819|page=10|ep=771}} and jumping off Zou.{{Qref|chap=822|page=17|ep=776}}

He very often supports Luffy and aids him in his quests even though they do not have much to do with his own, such as helping him infiltrate Doflamingo's palace,{{Qref|chap=734|chap2=736|ep=666|ep2=668}} impersonating Doflamingo himself,{{Qref|chap=740|page=15|ep=673}} and providing various outfits when needed.{{Qref|chap=978|page=10}} He even wished to join Luffy's mission to recover [[Sanji]] but could not do so due to his obligations in Wano.{{Qref|chap=820|page=17|ep=773}} Furthermore, he is very grateful for Luffy's efforts to help Momonosuke grow as a leader, even admitting to his fellow retainers that Luffy sometimes knows better than they do when it comes to [[Kouzuki Oden|Oden]]'s son.{{Qref|chap=819|page=15|ep=772}} He is very grateful to Luffy for having saved Momonosuke and eventually admitted to him the truth behind his and Momonosuke's quest, having originally told him that they are father and son.{{Qref|chap=817|page=4-9|ep=768}} He told Kaidou that he believes Luffy will achieve his dream of becoming the [[Pirate#Pirate King|Pirate King]] and firmly added that even if the [[Nine Red Scabbards]] perished, Luffy will still be here to take him down.{{Qref|chap=987|page=10}}

Luffy is very kind to Kin'emon and even wanted him to join his crew when he first met his legs, finding them to be fun.{{Qref|chap=656|page=18|ep=581}} He has worked well with him as an ally and was more than happy to have him join his crew to sail all the way back to Wano. He sympathized greatly with their quest to reclaim Wano and loathed Kaidou for what he did to him and his family.{{Qref|chap=818|page=16|ep=770}} This has led him to become a passionate ally to Kin'emon and led to him defeating Kaidou, not just for his own sake, but for his as well. Despite how much he respects Kin'emon, he refused his request to form an alliance, instead turning his attention to Momonosuke and demand that he be the one to ask him as he is their leader.{{Qref|chap=819|page=10-14|ep=771}} This was done for Momonosuke's sake and not actually out of any disrespect towards Kin'emon himself, something he understood. When Luffy was shown Kin'emon's grave by [[Trafalgar D. Water Law|Trafalgar Law]], he became worried that he had died but was relieved to see him alive shortly after.{{Qref|chap=919|page=10-11|ep=909}} When the Nine Red Scabbards were brutally defeated, Luffy rushed to Kin'emon's aid as he lamented their lack of strength to defeat Kaidou, he then tearfully asked Luffy to save Wano, which he readily agreed as it is the country of his friend.{{Qref|chap=1000|page=10-12}}

After Kaidou's defeat, Luffy showed his respect and gratitude when he told Kin'emon he was welcome to join his crew if he ever decides to become a pirate.{{Qref|chap=1057}}

===Tama===
[[File:Tama Eating Oshiruko.png|thumb|left|220px|Luffy watches Tama eat some fresh food.|alt=]]

[[Tama]] is a young girl from the [[Kuri]] region of [[Wano Country|Wano]] and has become a supportive ally of Luffy during the [[Wano Country Arc]]. The two get along incredibly well and have grown fond of one another. Tama greatly admires Luffy and finds him amazing. She constantly refers to him affectionately as "big brother". Luffy deeply cares for Tama and promised her that he will defeat the [[Four Emperors|emperor]], [[Kaidou]], and end his reign over Wano and remove [[Kurozumi Orochi]] from power so she can eat freely again. Luffy would eventually make good on this promise for Tama.

Luffy met Tama when he inadvertently saved her after she was captured by two members of the [[Beasts Pirates]]. After Luffy defeated them, Tama offered to surrender herself to him but after realizing that he would not harm her, she immediately became thankful and quickly befriended Luffy. She then took him to her house and fed him some of her rice.{{Qref|name=tama|chap=911|page=5-6, 9-19|ep=893|Tama makes her debut.}} It was here that Luffy was informed about the serious plight the citizens of Wano face because of Kaidou, which boosted his resolve to defeat the emperor.

From the moment she met him, Tama had a great intrigue in Luffy, finding him kind, friendly, and amazing. She is very grateful for Luffy's aid and gave up her own rice, which was meant to be her annual food supply, for him. Having met Luffy's brother, [[Portgas D. Ace|Ace]], a few years prior, she has started to see a lot of resemblance between Luffy and Ace.{{Qref|chap=918|page=6, 16|ep=906|ep2=908|Luffy's actions remind Tama of Ace.}} She was briefly angry with Luffy when he informed her that Ace had died, not wanting to believe it.{{Qref|chap=912|page=3-4|ep=|Luffy reports Ace's death to Tama.}} When she was captured by [[Holed'em]], she cried out for Luffy to save her and was overjoyed when he eventually arrived.{{Qref|chap=915|page=7|ep=}} She was very worried for Luffy after finding out he had been captured by the Beasts Pirates but was reassured by [[Tony Tony Chopper|Chopper]] that he would be fine.{{Qref|chap=925}} She joined the group to take over [[Udon]] in order to save Luffy and was extremely happy to be reunited with him. Despite knowing who Ace is, she was initially unaware that Luffy is his brother.

Tama would eventually arrive on [[Onigashima]] where Luffy planned to take down Kaidou.{{Qref|chap=995}} Here she befriended [[Nami]] who subsequently informed here that Luffy is Ace's brother.{{Qref|chap=999}} She was initially upset at how she acted towards Luffy regarding Ace but was reassured by Nami that Luffy would not have been upset by it. She spent most of her time worrying for Luffy in his battle against Kaidou and cried alongside Nami when it appeared he had been killed{{Qref|chap=1043}} and cried tears of joy when he was alive.{{Qref|chap=1044}} Following his victory over the emperor she was filled with great joy.{{Qref|chap=1050}}

Luffy has gone out of his way to help Tama. When he was taken to her house, he felt extremely guilty for eating the rice she had given him after finding out she had little to eat.{{Qref|chap=911}} When she fell ill after drinking toxic water from a nearby river, Luffy resolved to get her medical aid and carried her to [[Okobore Town]].{{Qref|chap=913}} He was happy to see her enjoying some fresh food and was feeling better. He was infuriated when she had been kidnapped and chased her down all the way to Bakura Town.{{Qref|chap=914}} He rescued her from Holed'em but became enraged after seeing what Holed'em had done to her cheek, attacking him with a powerful Red Hawk Punch.{{Qref|chap=917}} He later promised Tama that before leaving Wano, he will ensure that she won't have to live with hunger. After discovering that Tama had been attacked by Kaidou and presumed to have been killed, Luffy became extremely angry and outright challenged the emperor to a fight that he quickly lost.{{Qref|chap=923}} Evidence of Tama's impact on Luffy can be found in his impassioned speech to the Udon Prisoners where he makes mentioned of her to them all{{Qref|chap=949}}, and also during the raid on Onigashima where he blows his cover after seeing how recklessly the Beasts Pirates were wasting good food.{{Qref|chap=984}} In his final blow to Kaidou, he declared that he wishes to create a world where his friends can eat freely.{{Qref|chap=1049}} After becoming Shinobu's kunoichi apprentice, Tama swears that she will join Luffy's crew when she can properly use ninjutsu, to which he accepts.{{Qref|chap=1056}}

===Hyougoro===
[[File:Hyougoro and Luffy.png|thumb|220px|Luffy and Hyougoro during Queen's Inferno Sumo.]]

[[Hyougoro]], also known as "Hyougoro of the flower", is a former [[Yakuza]] boss who is well known across [[Wano]]. Luffy first met him inside Udon Prison after his initial defeat to [[Kaidou]]. Immediately the two got on well, Luffy was kind to the old man whilst Hyougoro was polite and courteous towards the straw hat captain. Whilst Luffy is much stronger than Hyougoro, he chose to become a student of his in order to learn advance [[Busoshoku Haki]]. Since his and Luffy's escape from prison he has remained a determined ally and joined the [[Ninja-Pirate-Mink-Samurai Alliance|Ninja-Pirate-Mink-Samurai alliance]] where he partook in the successful [[Raid on Onigashima]].

Luffy first saw Hyougoro being assaulted by [[Dobon]]. He attacked the Shinuchi in his defense, despite the threat of execution, and successfully defeated him before carrying Hyougoro to safety.{{Qref|chap=926}} Luffy took pity on the old man, due to Udon's prison's rule that you can only eat via tokens that you earn from work, meaning Hyougoro was at risk of starvation because of his small and weak frame. Thus, Luffy was more than happy to give him some of his own tokens in order to eat.{{Qref|chap=928}} Later on, Luffy spotted [[Daifugo]] assaulting Hyougoro and once more he defended the old man before he carried him on his back to attempt an escape from the prison.{{Qref|chap=934|chap2=935}} During [[Queen]]'s Sumo Inferno, Luffy remained protective of Hyougoro, happily taking on all fighters by himself as a means to get stronger.{{Qref|chap=936|chap2=937}} At one point he used his advance [[Kenbunshoku Haki]] to help Hyougoro avoid being hit.{{Qref|chap=939}}

Eventually, Hyougoro revealed to Luffy, after he understood what his goal was, that he was capable of using an extremely advanced version of Busoshoku Haki like [[Silvers Rayleigh]].{{Qref|chap=939}} Luffy was stunned by this ability before enthusiastically agreeing to become his student in order to learn from him. Despite many early efforts, he was not able to achieve the advanced Busoshoku Haki, it was only until he desperately needed to save Hyougoro's life that he was able to unleash the same power he saw Rayleigh use back on Sabaody.{{Qref|chap=946|page=16|ep=945}} Following their escape from the prison, Luffy trained under him until the day of the [[Fire Festival]] arrived, at which point they headed to [[Onigashima]] where they successfully took down Kaidou.

Hyougoro is very polite to Luffy and looks at him with great admiration for his courage, strength and honesty. Despite his great status amongst the people of Wano, he held no superiority over Luffy or demanded respect. Instead, he was very humble and felt that he was nothing more than a burden to him during the Sumo Inferno fight. He even went as far as to offer his own life in exchange for Luffy's to Queen.{{Qref|chap=935|page=16|ep=931}} Most of the time, he constantly apologized to Luffy and tried his best to be helpful towards him. He decided to teach Luffy his advanced Busoshoku Haki that proved to be invaluable in Luffy's victory over Kaidou.

Due to his old age, and loss of hope, he had reserved himself to an inevitable death but felt fulfilled having met Luffy, seeing him as an inspiration of the Wano of old before Kaidou and [[Orochi]] came to power, but still planned to let himself die. It was only when he was visited by [[Raizo]] in the middle of the night, and informed of the situation, that he found a new will to live again and was determined to aid Luffy. He commented that it is fate that Luffy was brought to Udon, where many potential allies for his cause are placed.{{Qref|chap=940|page=16-17|ep=937}} When former Yakuza bosses, who were also imprisoned, became hostile towards the straw hat captain he vouched for him, and did so again to the prisoners of Udon. His inspiration of Luffy is such that, upon seeing Luffy's Gear Fourth form, commented that he looked like a Wisdom King.{{Qref|chap=990|ep=1001}}

As a teacher, Hyougoro does his best to help Luffy. Once he learned Luffy's goal was to further his Busoshoku Haki, or "Ryuo" as it is known in the land of Wano, he was more than willing to help him.{{Qref|chap=939|page=11-17|ep=935|ep2=936}} He was impressed by his hidden talent and told him that his Haki is developing beyond what he is able to teach him. Such is his determination, he willingly stood in the path of the [[emperor]], [[Charlotte Linlin|Big Mom]], in order to incentivize Luffy to fully master his Haki.{{Qref|chap=946|page=14|ep=945}} Following his and Luffy's escape, he continued to train Luffy until the day of the Fire Festival.

===Yamato===
[[File:Yamato and Luffy.png|thumb|left|220px|Luffy and Yamato charge into battle.]]

[[Yamato]] is the son of [[Kaidou]] and an ally to Luffy. The two became friends and allies when Luffy stormed Kaidou's castle and Yamato came to find him. Despite being members of opposing parties, Yamato revealed his wish to defeat his father and leave Onigashima with Luffy. The two have developed a sense of mutual trust. Yamato believed that Luffy would be the one that can open up [[Wano]]'s borders and defeat Kaidou, something his hero, [[Kouzuki Oden]], had always wanted. Luffy is sympathetic to Yamato and happily accepted him as an ally to take down Kaidou. The two eventually succeeded in their endeavor in taking down Kaidou.

The two first met when Luffy was in the middle of battling [[Ulti]]. Yamato had slipped away from the party being held in [[Orochi]]'s honor and, coincidentally, Ulti, a member of the Flying Six who were tasked with finding him, stumbled onto Luffy. Yamato then arrived and immediately defeated Ulti before carrying Luffy away to somewhere secluded. Once alone, he revealed his identity to Luffy, his dream to become just like Kouzuki Oden and his wish to join Luffy's crew.

Yamato implicitly trusts Luffy because he is the brother of [[Portgas D. Ace]], who he had met when he arrived on Wano two years prior. Ace had told Yamato all about Luffy, and informed him of Luffy's dream that he told him and [[Sabo]] as children. When he heard this, Yamato gained immense admiration for Luffy, and drew comparison to what [[Gol D. Roger]] had said to Oden and [[Whitebeard]], that he had read in Oden's journal.{{Qref|chap=1000|page=4-6}} Initially, he wished to join Ace's [[Spade Pirates|crew]] but failed to do so and instead vowed to join Luffy's when the opportunity arrives.{{Qref|name=c985|chap=985}} He was determined to find and speak with Luffy when he had arrived on Wano and even clashed with him just to achieve this.{{qref|chap=983}}{{qref|name=c984|chap=984}} Furthermore, he has faith in Luffy's abilities and strength and wished for him to save him from Kaidou, open up Wano's borders{{qref|name=c984}} and, because of his intense admiration for Oden, to join Luffy's crew in order to be free and explore the sea just like he had done.{{Qref|name=c985}} Yamato also believes that Luffy is destined to save Wano. When talking to [[Kouzuki Momonosuke|Momonosuke]], he recites a passage in Oden's journal where he talks of great pirates that will come to Wano twenty years ahead of his time and defeat Kaidou, and heavily implies that he believes Luffy stands at the apex of these pirates.{{Qref|chap=1000|page=7-8}} This belief would bear fruit, as Luffy successfully defeated Kaidou.{{Qref|chap=1049}}

Luffy did not immediately see Yamato as an enemy, as he noted he did not attempt to hurt him when he clashed with Ulti. However, the urgency of his mission meant he had no desire to talk to him and thus tried to escape. He ended up fighting Yamato that caused major destruction around them before he was taken to an attic by him where he finally agreed to talk. Luffy was shocked to discover he was actually born as a woman and that he even knew Ace. After hearing his story he accepted his help and demanded that he show him the way to save Momonosuke. It was immediately after that he agreed to work with Yamato to take down Kaidou.{{Qref|name=c985}}{{Qref|name=c986|chap=986}} Luffy has come to trust him enough to ask him to help Shinobu protect Momonosuke.{{Qref|chap=988|page=11}}

It appears the two are somewhat fond of each other. Yamato took great care of Luffy as best he could throughout his battle and afterwards. He stepped in when Luffy was temporarily out of action{{Qref|chap=1016}} and caught him as he fell from the sky after he delivered the final blow towards Kaidou.{{Qref|chap=1050}} He refused to eat or bathe until Luffy had woken up following the battle, giving the straw hat captain a hug as soon as he did so.{{Qref|chap=1052}} Luffy also quickly came to care for him and his predicament, as he chose to [[Haki/Busoshoku Haki#Internal Destruction|remove]] the [[Explosive#Bomb Collar|explosive handcuffs]] that Kaidou had put on him that would explode if he tried to leave [[Onigashima]].{{Qref|chap=986}} He also has not expressed any direct objections of him joining his crew and respects his preference to be recognized as a man. While Luffy approved of Yamato joining his crew after the [[Raid on Onigashima|battle]], Admiral [[Aramaki|Ryokugyu]] attack on Wano caused Yamato to realize others will try the same now that Kaidou was gone and decides to stay on Wano to help protect it. Luffy agreed and entrusted Yamato to protect Wano for him. Before leaving Wano, Luffy told Yamato he was free to join his crew anytime in the future and they would come pick him up.

Luffy refers to Yamato by the nickname {{Nihongo|"Yama-o"|ヤマ男}}, similar to the nicknames he uses for [[Trafalgar D. Water Law|Trafalgar Law]], [[Bartolomeo]], and [[Eustass Kid]]. Yamato appears to not understand Luffy's use of nicknames, as evidenced by the attempt to correct Luffy with the former's actual name,{{Qref|name=c986}} as well as [[Ulti]]'s name when Luffy gives her a nickname as well.{{Qref|chap=987}}

==Past==
===Childhood===
Luffy was born 19 years ago in [[Foosha Village]] to [[Monkey D. Dragon]] and an unknown woman. Dragon left Luffy in the care of his grandfather, [[Monkey D. Garp]], who did many dangerous things to Luffy to make him stronger, like throwing him down a deep ravine, leaving him alone in the wild, and tying him to a balloon.{{Qref|chap=432|page=3|ep=314}}

[[File:Luffy Stabs Himself.png|thumb|left|210px|Luffy inflicting the scar on his face.]]

When Luffy was 6, [[Shanks]] and the [[Red Hair Pirates]] stationed themselves in Foosha Village. While they were there, their sniper [[Yasopp]] frequently told Luffy that he had a son his age named [[Usopp]].{{Qref|name=c25|chap=25|ep=10}} Luffy wanted to join the Red Hair Pirates, and after they had been in the village for nearly a year, he stabbed himself under his left eye to prove he was tough enough to be a pirate.

Luffy and the Red Hair Pirates then went to the Partys Bar, where Luffy continued to get Shanks to let him join them unsuccessfully. He found the [[Gomu Gomu no Mi]] in a chest and ate it with his meal, not knowing what it was. As he did this, the mountain bandit [[Higuma]] and his gang entered the bar and demanded sake. The bartender [[Makino]] informed them that the Red Hair Pirates had consumed all the sake available, and when Shanks offered him the last bottle, Higuma smashed it against his head. Shanks only responded by cleaning up the mess, and Higuma abused him some more before leaving. Luffy was outraged that Shanks did not retaliate, and Shanks grabbed his arm when he tried to leave, causing it to stretch. The Red Hair Pirates realized in shock that Luffy had eaten the [[Devil Fruit]] they took and revealed to Luffy that he would never be able to swim for the rest of his life.

<div style="float:right">[[File:Shanks Saves Luffy.png|thumb|210px|Shanks loses his left arm while saving Luffy.]]</div>

The Red Hair Pirates later set sail, and Luffy enjoyed his new rubber body. One day, he was sitting in the Partys Bar when Higuma's gang returned. Luffy picked a fight with them, and they quickly overpowered him. Before Higuma could kill Luffy, the Red Hair Pirates then arrived, and [[Lucky Roux]] shot one of the bandits that threatened them before [[Benn Beckman]] defeated the rest of Higuma's men by himself. However, Higuma threw a smoke bomb and escaped to sea with Luffy. There, he kicked Luffy overboard, and a [[Sea King]] known as the [[Lord of the Coast]] came and ate Higuma before going to eat Luffy. However, Shanks then arrived and saved Luffy before scaring away the Sea King; however, Luffy was left deeply saddened due to Shanks having lost his left arm in the process of saving him.

{{Cquote|Master Rayleigh, I was really surprised!! Over in the East Blue...! There was a kid who said the same things as Captain Roger...! Those exact same words as the captain!|2=Shanks to [[Silvers Rayleigh]], talking about Luffy}}

Later, the Red Hair Pirates prepared to depart Foosha Village for good, and Luffy had decided that he would instead set sail on his own. Shanks teased him about being too weak, and Luffy declared that he would become the [[Pirate#Pirate King|Pirate King]] and form a stronger crew than Shanks'. In response, Shanks gave Luffy his [[Straw Hat#Gol D. Roger/Shanks/Monkey D. Luffy|straw hat]], telling him to return it once he had become a great pirate.{{Qref|name=romancedawn|chap=1|ep=4}}

===Luffy's New Family: Bandits and Brothers===
After the Red Hair Pirates left, Garp took Luffy to [[Mt. Colubo]] and placed him in the care of the mountain bandit [[Curly Dadan]] and the [[Dadan Family]]. He introduced Luffy to Dadan's other ward [[Portgas D. Ace]], but Ace was cold toward Luffy.{{Qref|chap=582|ep=493}} Every day, Ace would travel away from the Dadan Family hideout, and Luffy attempted to follow him. Ace would put obstacles in his path to stop him, but Luffy continued following him.

Eventually, Luffy made it to [[Gray Terminal]], where he found Ace counting money with a boy named [[Sabo]]. When Luffy went up to them, Ace and Sabo captured him and talked about killing him to keep their secret safe. [[Porchemy]] of the [[Bluejam Pirates]] then came walking through the woods, and as Ace and Sabo hid from him, they left Luffy to be captured. Porchemy took Luffy to his base and interrogated him about the money Ace and Sabo had stolen from his crew. Luffy refused to answer him, even when Porchemy nearly beat him to death with spiked gloves.{{Qref|chap=583|ep=493|ep2=494}} Ace and Sabo then came to the base and freed Luffy, with Ace beating Porchemy.

[[File:Sakazuki (Ceremony) Infobox.png|thumb|left|210px|Luffy, Ace, and [[Sabo]] sharing sake to become "sworn brothers".]]

After this incident, Luffy, Ace, and Sabo became friends and went on many adventures together, becoming known throughout the [[Goa Kingdom]].{{Qref|chap=584|ep=494|ep2=495}} One day, they went to a restaurant in Goa and broke out without paying. As they ran away, a man called out to Sabo, though Sabo did not respond. After escaping the city, Luffy and Ace forced Sabo to tell them who the man was. Sabo admitted that the man was his father and a member of Goa's nobility; he had run away from his family due to their preoccupation with maintaining their status. Luffy, Ace, and Sabo then shared their dreams, deciding to sail as pirates to achieve them when they turned 17. They then [[Sakazuki (Ceremony)#Brothers' Sake Cups|exchanged sake cups]] to become sworn brothers, solidifying their bond.

The three brothers continued adventuring and honing their abilities, with Luffy struggling to attack properly with his Devil Fruit. However, their time was cut short as Sabo's father had the Bluejam Pirates capture Luffy and Ace to force Sabo to return to his family. Sabo agreed to return on the condition that the Bluejam Pirates do not harm Luffy and Ace.{{Qref|chap=585|ep=496}} After Sabo left, [[Bluejam]] put Luffy and Ace to work moving boxes around Gray Terminal. A few days later, Bluejam told the two brothers to help him burn down Gray Terminal that night. Luffy and Ace refused, and Bluejam asked about the location of their treasure. They did not tell him, causing him to tie them to a pole in Gray Terminal.{{Qref|chap=586|ep=500|ep2=501}} As night fell, the Bluejam Pirates set Gray Terminal ablaze, and Ace managed to free himself and Luffy as flames surrounded them. The Bluejam Pirates then confronted the duo with getting the location of their treasure, but Ace knocked most of them out with [[Haki/Haoshoku Haki|Haoshoku Haki]] before the Dadan Family came to the rescue. Luffy fled Gray Terminal with the Dadan Family, while Ace and Dadan stayed behind to fight Bluejam.{{Qref|chap=587|ep=501}}

[[File:Gomu Gomu no Pistol.png|thumb|210px|Luffy punching out the Lord of the Coast with his improved '''Gomu Gomu no Pistol'''.]]

The following day, Ace and Dadan returned to Mt. Colubo, heavily injured but alive. However, [[Dogra]] later told Luffy and Ace that Sabo had been killed by a [[World Noble]] while setting out to sea, leaving them devastated. Luffy went to the coast and cried all night, and Ace came to him the next morning.{{Qref|chap=588|ep=503}} Luffy made Ace promise that he would not die, swearing to become stronger. For the next seven years, the two continued adventuring and training to get stronger, with Luffy learning to throw effective long-range punches with his stretching. A 14-year-old Luffy then bid farewell to Ace, who sailed out to sea as a pirate upon turning 17. During this time Luffy was being chased by a tiger after bonking its head, while [[Bartholomew Kuma]] was onboard his ship in the [[East Blue]] awaiting orders.{{Qref|chap=1100|page=17|ep=}} A year later when Luffy was 16, he was training a [[Gomu Gomu no Mi/Techniques#Gomu Gomu no Ono|special attack]] he planned on using in the future enemies that might beat or capture a future member of his crew he planned on starting. Kuma observed Luffy using this attack thinking back on a past conversation he had with his father Dragon before disappearing, Luffy however briefly sensed Kuma's disappearance wondering where it came from but assumed it must have been another animal on the island before setting out to hunt it.{{Qref|chap=1101|page=3-5|ep=}} Another year passed before Luffy became a pirate himself, and he bid farewell to the Dadan Family before going to Foosha Village to say goodbye and set sail.{{Qref|chap=589|ep=504}} When the Lord of the Coast emerged to confront him, Luffy punched it away with '''Gomu Gomu no Pistol'''. As he sailed, Luffy plotted to recruit ten crewmates, get a [[Jolly Roger]], and become the Pirate King.{{Qref|name=romancedawn}}{{-}}

==East Blue Saga==
===Romance Dawn Arc===
[[File:Luffy Fights Alvida.png|thumb|left|210px|[[Alvida]] ineffectively strikes her mace against Luffy's rubber body.]]

The first thing that Luffy came across on his voyage was a whirlpool, which pulled his ship in. Luffy managed to survive by hiding in a barrel, which washed ashore on [[Goat Island]]. The [[Alvida Pirates]]' cabin boy [[Koby]] rolled the barrel to a storehouse, and some of his crewmates went to open it, causing Luffy to knock them out as he emerged accidentally. Luffy asked Koby for a ship, and Koby gave him a boat he had made to escape, revealing that he was serving the Alvida Pirates against his will but was too afraid to try to get away. Luffy did not think much of Koby's lack of resolve, telling the cabin boy that he intended to become Pirate King. Koby's captain [[Alvida]] then came and destroyed the boat, but as she confronted Koby, the cabin boy found the resolve to stand up to her. Luffy was impressed with Koby and intercepted Alvida's attempt to strike Koby with her mace. The mace did not affect Luffy, and he knocked out Alvida with one punch. Luffy then told the Alvida Pirates to get him and Koby a boat, and they complied.

[[File:Luffy Asks Zoro to Join Crew.png|thumb|210px|Luffy asking the bounty hunter [[Roronoa Zoro|Zoro]] to become the first of his crew.]]

As they sailed, Koby was concerned about the fate Luffy would meet when sailing on the [[Grand Line]], known as the pirate's graveyard. Luffy replied that he would assemble a powerful crew, starting with the powerful [[Bounty Hunter|bounty hunter]] [[Roronoa Zoro]].{{Qref|chap=2|ep=1}} With Koby's navigation skills, they made it to [[Shells Town]] where Zoro was being held captive by the Marines led by [[Captain (Marine Rank)|Captain]] [[Morgan]]. After eating at a restaurant, Luffy and Koby prepared to split up at the Marine base. Luffy looked over the wall and saw Zoro tied up, and Zoro offered to help him if he was freed. Luffy and Koby then watched as a little girl named [[Rika]] climbed over the wall to feed Zoro some rice balls. However, Morgan's son [[Helmeppo]] then came and stopped her, having his Marine guards throw her over the wall. Luffy caught Rika, and as Helmeppo's group left, he climbed over the wall to talk to Zoro. Zoro refused to join Luffy's crew, saying Helmeppo had promised to let him go free if he could survive without nourishment for a month. However, he asked Luffy to feed him Rika's rice balls that Helmeppo had smashed into the ground and told him to tell Rika that they were delicious.

Luffy returned to Shells Town and relayed the message to Rika, and she revealed that Zoro was imprisoned after protecting her from Helmeppo's [[Soro|dog]]. Helmeppo then came into town and announced to the citizens that Zoro would be executed, and when Luffy questioned his promise, he revealed that it was a lie. Luffy then punched Helmeppo,{{Qref|chap=3|ep=2}} and as Koby held him back from attacking him more, Helmeppo said his father would get revenge on Luffy. Luffy then went back to the Marine base to recruit Zoro again. When he found out that The Marines had confiscated Zoro's sword, Luffy went to find them and offer to give them back if Zoro joined his crew. Hearing voices on the roof of the base, Luffy stretched his arms and pulled himself up. However, he sent himself flying over the top and grabbed ropes that the Marines were using to erect a statue of Morgan, causing the statue to fall and break. Luffy then captured Helmeppo and ran inside, telling Helmeppo to give him the location of Zoro's sword.{{Qref|chap=4|ep=2}} Helmeppo did so, and Luffy used him as a shield to keep from being shot by the Marines. Luffy went to Helmeppo's room, where he saw three swords. Seeing Zoro and Koby being confronted by Morgan and the Marines outside, Luffy took all the swords and jumped out the window, intercepting the bullets being shot at Zoro and Koby.

Luffy's rubber body absorbed the bullets and sent them flying back at the Marines. Zoro said that all three of the swords were his, and agreed to join Luffy if they survived this battle.{{Qref|chap=5|ep=2}} As Luffy tried to untie Zoro, Zoro told him to give him his swords instead. Zoro cut himself free to intercept the charging Marines, and Luffy kicked all of them away. As Morgan told his subordinates to shoot themselves, Luffy attacked the Marine captain and quickly overpowered him. Helmeppo then threatened to shoot Koby, and Luffy turned to attack him, turning his back on Morgan. However, Luffy was able to punch Helmeppo as Zoro cut down Morgan.{{Qref|chap=6|ep=3}} To the pirates' surprise, the Marines celebrated the defeat of their captain.

Luffy, Zoro, and Koby then went to eat at Rika's family's restaurant, but the Marines came and told them they had to leave. They questioned if Koby was going with them, and Luffy started talking about Koby's past to goad Koby into hitting him. This plan worked, and Koby joined the Marines. As Luffy and Zoro set sail, Koby and the Marines came to the coast and saluted them as thanks for freeing them from Morgan.{{Qref|chap=7|ep=3}}

===Orange Town Arc===
As they sailed toward the Grand Line, Luffy and Zoro realized that neither of them had any navigation ability. They quickly grew hungry, and Luffy attempted to catch a [[Pinky|bird]] flying above them, only to be dragged away by the bird. The bird flew over [[Orange Town]], where the [[Buggy Pirates]] shot a cannonball at it. The bird dropped Luffy into the cannonball's path, blasting him onto the ground between a woman and a group of Buggy Pirates chasing her. The woman greeted Luffy as her boss, causing the pirates to attack him to find a treasure map she had stolen. They knocked Luffy's hat off, causing him to defeat them quickly. Afterwards, the woman asked Luffy if he wanted to join her, saying her name was [[Nami]], and she stole from pirates.{{Qref|chap=8|ep=4}}

Luffy refused to join Nami, and they went into a house as she told him that she was planning to use Captain [[Buggy]]'s treasure map to reach the Grand Line and rob even more powerful pirates. When he found out that Nami was a skilled navigator, Luffy asked her to join his crew, but she refused due to hating pirates. However, Nami said she would go with him if he went with her to visit Buggy. Luffy did so, but to his shock, Nami tied him up and offered him to Buggy as a prisoner, causing Buggy to put him in a cage.{{Qref|chap=9|ep=5}} As the Buggy Pirates partied on the roof of the tavern, Luffy tried biting through the bars and pleading to be let go. Buggy decided to execute Luffy with a [[Buggy Balls#Buggy's Balls|Buggy Ball]], and he leveled an entire row of houses to demonstrate its power. He told Nami to fire the Buggy Ball at Luffy, but she decided not to and rebelled against the Buggy Pirates. As the Buggy Pirates went to attack her, Zoro arrived and stopped them. Zoro then cut Buggy into pieces,{{Qref|chap=10|ep=5}} but Buggy revealed that he could separate his body parts at will with the [[Bara Bara no Mi]] as he stabbed Zoro with his disembodied hand. Luffy then called Buggy "Big Nose", causing Buggy to send one of his hands to cut Luffy with a knife. However, Luffy caught and broke the knife with his teeth, and he had Zoro and Nami flip the cannon around and fire the Buggy Ball at the Buggy Pirates.{{Qref|chap=11|ep=5|ep2=6}}

[[File:Luffy Knocks Out Mohji.png|thumb|left|Luffy defeats Mohji with one punch.]]

Afterwards, Zoro picked up the cage and dragged Luffy away from the tavern. In front of a pet food store, they stopped in front of a dog named [[Chouchou]] was guarding. Luffy poked Chouchou to see if he was alive, causing Chouchou to attack him. Nami then found Luffy and Zoro and gave them the key to Luffy's cage, but Chouchou immediately ate it. As Luffy was shaking Chouchou, Mayor [[Boodle]] came and told him to stop, explaining why Chouchou stood in front of the store. Buggy's subordinate [[Mohji]] then came to confront Luffy on his lion [[Richie]], and Richie destroyed the cage in a single attack. The lion then hit Luffy through a house and onto the street behind it, though Luffy was unharmed.{{Qref|chap=12|ep=6}} Luffy then walked back to find Zoro, and he saw that Mohji had set the pet food store ablaze. He confronted Mohji and Richie and defeated the lion by spinning his arms around before grabbing his face and spinning him facefirst into the ground. Luffy then grabbed Mohji and defeated him with one punch to the ground. Luffy went back to the store and gave Chouchou the pet food that Mohji had taken.{{Qref|chap=13|ep=6}}

Boodle had enough of Buggy's tyranny and went to fight him, and Buggy demolished many of the buildings around them with a Buggy Ball. Zoro emerged unharmed from the destruction, and Luffy intended to help Boodle. Nami agreed to work with him, even though she still refused to be a pirate.{{Qref|chap=14|ep=6}} Luffy came to the tavern, where he removed Buggy's disembodied hand from Boodle's neck. Boodle protested against the pirates helping him, and Luffy knocked him out because he was getting in their way. Luffy insulted Buggy again, and the pirate shot a Buggy Ball at him. However, Luffy ballooned himself with '''Gomu Gomu no Fusen''' and sent the Buggy Ball flying back, demolishing the tavern.{{Qref|chap=15|ep=6|ep2=7}} Buggy emerged from the wreckage and threw Mohji at Luffy, and Luffy easily kicked him aside.{{Qref|chap=16|ep=7}} Luffy then watched as Zoro battled [[Cabaji]], and as Nami went to a shack to steal Buggy's treasure, Luffy stomped on Buggy's hand to prevent him from interfering in Zoro's fight, allowing Zoro to defeat Cabaji.{{Qref|chap=17|ep=7}}

Luffy then confronted Buggy, and dodged the clown's long-distance knife strikes with his disembodied hands and legs. Buggy split off his body parts to dodge Luffy's attacks and managed to graze Luffy's face and damage his straw hat with a knife before stabbing the straw hat again. Luffy was enraged to see Buggy damaging his hat, which Buggy recognized as he was once on the same ship as Shanks. Luffy punched Buggy in the stomach, telling him never to compare himself to Shanks.{{Qref|chap=18|ep=7}} Buggy then detached his torso and flew to attack Nami,{{Qref|chap=19|ep=8}} but Luffy stopped him by kicking his groin. Buggy split himself into many pieces and flew them around to prevent Luffy from attacking him, but Luffy noticed his feet on the ground and tickled them. While Buggy was caught off-guard, Nami attempted to hit him with a bag of treasure, but he grabbed it instead. However, Luffy ran up and kicked Buggy in the face, and he saw Buggy's map to the Grand Line fall to the ground. Buggy then attempted to reform his body but only got his hands and feet back as Nami had tied up his other parts. Luffy then hit Buggy with '''Gomu Gomu no Bazooka''', sending him flying off the island.{{Qref|chap=20|ep=8}}

Luffy and Nami gathered up Buggy's treasure, with Nami agreeing to join the crew and find more treasure. They returned to Zoro and were confronted by the citizens, who were concerned about Boodle. Luffy admitted that he was a pirate and had knocked out the mayor, causing the citizens to chase after them in anger. However, Chouchou then stopped the citizens from chasing the Straw Hats, and Luffy left Buggy's treasure behind for the citizens to rebuild their town. They came to their boat and a boat that Nami had stolen from the Buggy Pirates, but the pirates she had stolen it from emerged from it to get revenge. However, they immediately ran away upon seeing Zoro. As the Straw Hats set sail, Boodle ran up to the dock and thanked them for saving him and the town. Later, Nami found out that Luffy left the money behind and got mad at him, but then laughed.{{Qref|chap=21|ep=8}}

===Syrup Village Arc===
====The Man in a Chest====
[[File:Luffy and Gaimon Laughing.png|thumb|210px|Luffy and [[Gaimon]] laughing over their mutual inability to read a map.]]

Nami fixed Luffy's straw hat, and Luffy and Zoro wondered what they should do next. When they spotted a [[Island of Rare Animals|nearby island]], they immediately rowed toward it despite Nami's protests. Luffy and Nami disembarked on the seemingly uninhabited island, leaving Zoro to sleep on the ship. Luffy and Nami met several strange animal hybrids, and a man called out to them from afar, calling himself the island's guardian and telling them to leave. Luffy and Nami ignored him, causing him to shoot Luffy. They then spotted the guardian, a man named [[Gaimon]] who was stuck in a treasure chest. Luffy and Nami talked to Gaimon and told them about their voyage, and he warned them that they would likely die trying to conquer the Grand Line. Gaimon then told them that he was once a pirate, and he had attempted to find treasure on this island on top of a cliff. However, he fell off the cliff and into a chest, and his crewmates had left him on the island; he could not even reach the treasure again due to being stuck in the chest.

Luffy and Nami offered to go and get the treasure for Gaimon, and Luffy pulled himself up the cliff face. He said nothing once he got to the treasure, and Gaimon understood that the chests were empty. Luffy asked Gaimon to join his crew and find the One Piece with him, but Gaimon decided to remain behind on the island and continue taking care of the animals. The Straw Hats then bid farewell to Gaimon and sailed off the island.{{Qref|chap=22|ep=18}}

====Meeting a Liar====
Nami told Luffy that they needed to plan ahead to find a real ship and more crewmates before they headed to the Grand Line, and she plotted for them to sail to the nearby [[Syrup Village]]. When the Straw Hats made landfall, they noticed the [[Usopp Pirates]] spying on them from atop a cliff. The captain, [[Usopp]], tried scaring them away by claiming he had 80 million men, but they knew he was lying. They went with him to the village restaurant, and he said their likeliest chance of getting a ship was by asking [[Kaya]], a bedridden girl who lived in a mansion. Usopp offered to join the crew as their captain, but they refused.{{Qref|chap=23|ep=9}}

Usopp then left to see Kaya, and the Straw Hats told his crewmates [[Ninjin]], [[Piiman]], and [[Tamanegi]] this when they came looking for him. The trio of children told the Straw Hats that their captain was telling lies to Kaya to cheer her up, and Luffy decided to ask Kaya for a ship. They came to her mansion and climbed over her gate and met her and Usopp at her window. However, Kaya's butler [[Kuro|Klahadore]] then came and confronted the group, saying he and Kaya could not give the Straw Hats a ship. He then degraded Usopp for being the son of a pirate, and as Usopp punched him, Luffy remembered hearing about Usopp from Yasopp.{{Qref|chap=24|ep=9|ep2=10}}

Klahadore forced the Straw Hats and Usopp Pirates off the property, and Luffy left Zoro and Nami to find Usopp on the cliff over the coast. There, he revealed to Usopp that he had met his father. However, Luffy and Usopp then spotted Klahadore meeting with [[Jango]] on the beach below and overheard them plotting to murder Kaya so Klahadore could inherit her fortune.{{Qref|name=c25}} They found out that Klahadore was actually the pirate Kuro, and his crew, the [[Black Cat Pirates]], was planning to raid Syrup Village during Kaya's assassination. Luffy shouted at the duo that they had heard them, and Jango hypnotized Luffy to put him to sleep. Luffy fell off the cliff and was unharmed but remained asleep, so Kuro and Jango believed him to be dead and left him there.{{Qref|chap=26|ep=10}}

Luffy was found by Zoro, Nami, and Usopp's underlings, and he told them about Kuro's plot. As they headed back to Syrup Village, Usopp came and lied to his crew that he had lied about the impending pirate attack.{{Qref|chap=27|ep=11}} As night fell, Usopp and the Straw Hats camped out on the beach, and Usopp swore to fend off the Black Cat Pirates, with the Straw Hats offering to help him. They decided to wait for the Black Cat Pirates at the path to the village and put oil on the path to impede their progress. However, they then heard the pirates coming from the north, and Usopp realized that they were heading toward Syrup Village from the opposite coast. He and the Straw Hats ran to the north, but Luffy went in the direction that felt coldest and so got lost.{{Qref|chap=28|ep=12}} Eventually, he and Zoro managed to make it to the north pass and beat back the Black Cat Pirates.{{Qref|chap=29|ep=12}} Jango hypnotized his subordinates to get up and become stronger, but Luffy fell under the hypnotism as well and charged toward the pirates. He easily beat all of them up and ripped off the stem and figurehead of their [[Bezan Black|ship]] to swing at them, but Jango then hypnotized him to fall asleep, causing him to collapse with the stem pinning him to the ground.{{Qref|chap=30|ep=13}}

[[File:Gomu Gomu no Kane.png|thumb|left|Luffy defeats Kuro with Gomu Gomu no Kane.]]

Luffy was eventually woken up by Nami stepping on his head and rejoined the fight, to which Kuro had arrived. Kaya then came and confronted Kuro, and as Kuro attempted to attack Usopp, Luffy punched the pirate in the chest from afar.{{Qref|chap=34|ep=14}} As Zoro and the Usopp Pirates went to protect Kaya, Luffy started battling Kuro.{{Qref|chap=36|ep=15}} Kuro dodged Luffy's attacks with his sheer speed and stood on Luffy's outstretched arm, allowing him to run on it and kick Luffy in the face. However, Luffy managed to intercept Kuro's left hand [[Cat Claws]] with a rock, allowing him to rip them off.{{Qref|chap=37|ep=15}} Luffy was then able to start keeping up with Kuro's quick movements and land more attacks on him.{{Qref|chap=38|ep=16}} In response, Kuro initiated his ultimate move '''Shakushi''', in which he raced around the clearing at a blinding speed and indiscriminately attacked both Luffy and his subordinates. However, as Kuro slashed Luffy across the chest, Luffy was able to grab onto his jacket and slam him to the ground. Luffy then wrapped his arms and legs around Kuro and headbutted him with '''Gomu Gomu no Kane''', defeating him.{{Qref|chap=39|ep=16|ep2=17}}

Luffy threw Kuro back to the Black Cat Pirates, allowing them to run away. He then collapsed due to blood loss and was caught by Nami.{{Qref|chap=40|ep=17}} Later, Luffy, Zoro, and Nami were eating at the village restaurant when Kaya came to offer them a ship. She took them to the coast, where she and [[Merry]] presented them with a caravel named the [[Going Merry]]. Usopp then came rolling down to the coast to start his own voyage, but the Straw Hats told him to come aboard and join them. They then sailed away on the Going Merry, and partied as a crew of four.{{Qref|chap=41|ep=17}}

===Baratie Arc===
====The Floating Restaurant====
[[File:Luffy Draws Straw Hat Jolly Roger.png|thumb|210px|Luffy's attempt to draw his Jolly Roger.]]

As the Straw Hats sailed on their new ship, Luffy drew his vision of the crew's Jolly Roger, but Usopp drew a final version due to Luffy's poor art skills. Luffy then unsuccessfully attempted to hit a distant rock with the cannon. Usopp shot the rock perfectly, causing Luffy to deem him the crew sniper. Later, as the Straw Hats sat indoors, the bounty hunter [[Johnny]] came on board and caused a commotion. When Luffy came out, Johnny attacked him for shooting the rock that he was resting on. However, he stopped attacking when Zoro came out, as he had worked with Zoro in the past. Johnny revealed that his partner [[Yosaku]] was on the verge of death, and Nami recognized that Yosaku had scurvy and so instructed Luffy and Usopp to give him some lime juice. After Yosaku regained his strength, the Straw Hats decided that they needed a cook before going to the Grand Line, and the two bounty hunters told them they could find one to recruit at the floating sea restaurant [[Baratie]].{{Qref|chap=42|ep=18|ep2=20}}

[[File:Luffy and Sanji Meet First Time.png|thumb|left|250px|Luffy meet Sanji, Baratie's sous chef.]]

Two to three days later, the Straw Hats reached Baratie. The Marine Lieutenant [[Fullbody]] pulled up alongside them and had his crew fire a cannonball at the Merry. Luffy deflected the cannonball with '''Gomu Gomu no Fusen''', but accidentally sent it flying into Baratie. He was then apprehended by Baratie's staff and taken to the head chef [[Zeff]], and since he did not have money to pay for the damage, Zeff made him work in the kitchen for a year.{{Qref|chap=43|ep=20}} Luffy protested against this sentence, causing Zeff to attack him. However, their scuffle inadvertently caused them to fall through the floor. They fell into the seating area, where they saw the sous chef [[Sanji]] beating up Fullbody. [[Gin]] of the [[Krieg Pirates]] then came into the restaurant from Fullbody's ship but was forced out by the cooks due to not having any money. However, Luffy later watched from afar as Sanji secretly fed Gin outside and decided that Sanji would be his crew's cook.{{Qref|chap=44|ep=21}} Luffy then approached Sanji and Gin and attempted to recruit the former, but the sous chef declined. After hearing of Luffy's goal, Gin warned him against going to the Grand Line.

Luffy was then put to work as a chore boy but was quickly ejected from the kitchen due to destroying the dishes and was reassigned to work as a waiter.{{Qref|chap=45|ep=21}} Two days later, Gin brought his captain [[Krieg|Don Krieg]] to Baratie, and Sanji fed the starving pirate despite the other cooks' wishes. However, Krieg then attacked Sanji after returning to full strength and decided to take over Baratie to take his crew back to the Grand Line after being chased out.{{Qref|chap=46|ep=22}} Luffy challenged Krieg to prevent him from conquering the Grand Line before him, and the cooks intended to fight as well. However, Zeff gave Krieg food to feed his starving subordinates outside.{{Qref|chap=47|ep=22}} As Krieg went out, a commotion suddenly started outside, and Luffy, Zoro, and Usopp went to check on Johnny and Yosaku. The bounty hunters were left hanging on the edge of Baratie, as they revealed that Nami had taken the crew's treasure and the Going Merry.{{Qref|chap=49|ep=23}}

Intent on having Nami as his crew's navigator, Luffy told Zoro and Usopp to take Johnny and Yosaku's ship and chase after her. However, they then saw [[Dracule Mihawk]], the greatest swordsman in the world and a member of the [[Seven Warlords of the Sea]], approaching the Krieg Pirates' damaged galleon.{{Qref|chap=50|ep=24}} Luffy watched as Zoro confronted Mihawk to take his title. Still, Mihawk trounced him.{{Qref|chap=51|ep=24}} As Zoro fell into the ocean, Luffy pulled himself toward Mihawk and attempted to attack him. However, Mihawk revealed that he had left Zoro alive, as he was impressed with the swordsman. Mihawk hoped he would meet Luffy and Zoro again as he departed, leaving Krieg's galleon in ruins. Zoro, Usopp, Johnny, and Yosaku then left to pursue Nami, with Luffy staying on Baratie to fight the Krieg Pirates and recruit Sanji. Luffy asked Zeff if he could be relieved of his chore boy duties if he fought off the Krieg Pirates, and Zeff readily agreed.{{Qref|chap=52|ep=24}}

====Battle for the Baratie====
Luffy pulled himself toward the Krieg Pirates, and hit several of them at once with his outstretched arms. He watched as Baratie's front deck expanded and the cooks rushed into battle,{{Qref|chap=53|ep=25}} but Krieg then hit him away with a chained spiked ball. Luffy flew back to the Baratie and landed on the back of [[Pearl]]'s head, causing Krieg's subordinate to hit his face on his shield and get a nosebleed.{{Qref|chap=54|ep=25}} In response to being injured, Pearl lit himself on fire and forced Luffy and Sanji back with his flames. As Sanji fought Pearl, Krieg attempted to intervene by throwing his spiked ball, but Luffy hit it away. He sent the ball flying into Krieg's galleon's mast, causing it to fall onto Pearl.

However, Gin then held Zeff at gunpoint,{{Qref|chap=55|ep=25}} forcing Sanji to stand down and take Pearl's attacks.{{Qref|chap=56|ep=26}} With Sanji refusing to fight, Luffy decided to destroy Baratie and shattered the front deck with '''Gomu Gomu no Battle Axe'''. Sanji was very angry with Luffy, as he wished to keep Zeff and the restaurant safe to honor his debt to the head chef, but Luffy told him that getting killed was a bad way to repay his debt. However, Gin attacked Pearl and defeated him with one blow, as he wished to repay Sanji for saving his life by taking Sanji on himself.{{Qref|chap=59|ep=26|ep2=27}} Luffy riled up the Krieg Pirates by failing to take them seriously, and Krieg fired an MH5 poison gas cannonball at him. Luffy tried to kick it away, but the cannonball turned out to be a shuriken bomb that cut Luffy with a burst of shuriken.{{Qref|chap=60|ep=27}} As Sanji battled Gin, Luffy charged toward Krieg to fight him but was forced back as Krieg rapidly fired stakes at him. Luffy tried charging again while Krieg was distracted but to the same result.

[[File:Luffy Hits Krieg With Gomu Gomu no Bullet.png|thumb|210px|Luffy battling Krieg.]]

Gin emerged victorious in his fight with Sanji but then broke down as he could not kill the cook.{{Qref|chap=61|ep=27}} In response, Krieg fired his MH5 ball at him. Luffy pulled gas masks off two of the Krieg Pirates and threw them at Sanji and Gin; he then desperately looked for one for himself and found one next to him right as the cannonball hit. However, after the poisonous gas cleared, Luffy realized that Gin had thrown his mask back at him, and the Krieg Pirate had thus inhaled the gas.{{Qref|chap=62|ep=27|ep2=28}} Angered at Krieg's attitude toward harming his subordinate, Luffy rushed toward him again and kept running even as stakes hit him. Krieg shrouded himself in a spiked cloak when Luffy geared up to punch him, but Luffy simply punched through it and injured his hand to hit him.{{Qref|chap=63|ep=28}}

[[File:Luffy Breaks Krieg's Armor With Gomu Gomu No Bazooka.png|thumb|left|210px|Luffy breaks Krieg's armor.]]

Krieg got up and repelled Luffy, but Luffy then kicked him in the head. In response, Krieg brought out his Great Battle Spear and overwhelmed Luffy as its swings caused explosions. He was eventually able to hit Luffy with the explosions, but Luffy could hit and shatter the spear blade in the process.{{Qref|chap=64|ep=28}} Krieg continued to try to hit him with explosions, but Luffy swung around the mast in the wreckage and barraged Krieg with attacks. Krieg was unharmed due to his Wootz Steel Armor and stood atop the mast as he unleashed bombs on the wreckage below. Luffy ran up the mast, and Krieg hit him with an explosion, but Luffy continued running and hit Krieg into the air. The attack did not harm Krieg, but Luffy then jumped over him in midair and slammed both fists into his chest with '''Gomu Gomu no Bazooka''', which finally broke his armor.{{Qref|chap=65|ep=29}} Although now injured, Krieg quickly responded by shooting an iron net around Luffy so he could throw him into the sea. However, Luffy managed to get his legs out of the net and twist them around until he clasped Krieg's face with his feet. He then spun Krieg around and slammed him into Baratie's deck with '''Gomu Gomu no Ozuchi''', defeating him. Luffy landed in the ocean but was quickly rescued by Sanji.{{Qref|chap=66|ep=29}}

Luffy woke up on a bed in Baratie, and Sanji told him that Gin hoped to meet him again in the Grand Line. Luffy asked Sanji to join his crew, and Sanji wished to remain at Baratie, but did tell Luffy that he dreamed of going to the Grand Line someday to find the legendary sea [[All Blue]]. The Baratie cooks then fed Luffy, and they abused Sanji to try to get him to leave. When Sanji went outside, they told Luffy to take him as a crewmate,{{Qref|chap=67|ep=30}} but Luffy refused until Sanji himself accepted. Yosaku then swam to the Baratie, and told Luffy that they had tracked Nami's course to an unbelievable island. Luffy immediately went to head off, and Sanji then agreed to join him. Luffy and Yosaku boarded a small ship belonging to Sanji, and Sanji bid a tearful farewell to Zeff and his coworkers before he set sail with his new captain.{{Qref|chap=68|ep=30}}

===Arlong Park Arc===
====Encounter with the Worst Man of the East Blue====
[[File:Luffy Draws Fish-Man.png|thumb|210px|Sanji laughing at Luffy's attempt to draw what a fish-man looks like.]]

As Yosaku took Luffy and Sanji to Nami's location, he told them about the Seven Warlords of the Sea, one of [[Three Great Powers|three organizations]] with power over the Grand Line. He revealed that one of them, Captain [[Jinbe]] of the [[Sun Pirates|Fish-Man Pirates]], had unleashed a fearsome [[Fish-Men|fish-man]] known as [[Arlong]] into the East Blue, and Nami had likely gone to his base at [[Arlong Park]]. Luffy was intrigued to hear of fish-men and drew a picture of what he thought one would look like.{{Qref|chap=69|ep=31}} As Sanji prepared food for them, the giant sea cow [[Momoo]] approached the trio's ship. Luffy punched Momoo to keep it away from their food but only made it mad. Sanji tried to feed Momoo, but then beat the sea cow into submission after it wanted to eat him as well,{{Qref|chap=73|ep=32}} and so the crew made Momoo pull them to Arlong Park.{{Qref|chap=74|ep=33}}

Momoo eventually reached Arlong Park and crashed into the shore, sending Luffy, Sanji, and Yosaku flying over the island on their ship. They landed in a clearing and crashed into Zoro in the process, and as the four of them recovered from the landing, Johnny ran toward them and revealed that Nami had killed Usopp. Luffy refused to believe Johnny and was about to attack him when Nami approached them.{{Qref|chap=75|ep=34}} She confirmed Johnny's report and told the Straw Hats to leave the island, saying she only pretended to be their friend to steal from them for her real captain Arlong. Johnny and Yosaku decided to take her advice and leave, but Luffy chose instead to lie down and take a nap. Sometime later, Usopp came across Luffy's group and revealed that Nami had only pretended to kill him to save his life from Arlong; he believed that Nami had an ulterior motive for working with Arlong. Nami's older sister [[Nojiko]] then approached the Straw Hats and told them that they should leave this island, but she offered to explain everything before they did.{{Qref|chap=76|ep=34}} However, Luffy had no interest in hearing her explanation and so walked away.{{Qref|chap=77|ep=34}}

[[File:Luffy Stops Nami.png|thumb|left|146px|Luffy stops Nami from stabbing herself in anger over Arlong's treachery.]]

Luffy walked to [[Cocoyasi Village]], and he watched as Marine [[16th Branch]] Captain [[Nezumi]] led a raid on Nami's home to confiscate the money she had stolen. Luffy asked Nami if he could help during the commotion, but she angrily told him she wanted nothing to do with him before running away.{{Qref|chap=80|ep=37}} Nami later returned to try to stop the villagers from going to attack Arlong, but failed. She then started stabbing her [[Arlong Pirates]] tattoo when Luffy grabbed her arm to stop her. Nami tried to get Luffy to leave, but she eventually broke down and asked him to help as he stayed. Luffy accepted this request as he put his straw hat on her head and headed for Arlong Park, and when he reached Zoro, Usopp, and Sanji, they immediately went along with him. Luffy then punched through the gate to Arlong Park and asked which fish-man was Arlong.{{Qref|chap=81|ep=37}}{{-}}

====Destruction of Arlong Park====
[[File:Luffy Punches Arlong.png|thumb|210px|Luffy starts his battle with Arlong by punching him.]]

After Arlong identified himself, Luffy beat aside two of his subordinates before punching the fish-man. [[Hatchan]] then summoned Momoo to come to their aid, and although the sea cow was afraid of Luffy and Sanji, Arlong intimidated it into attacking. However, Luffy planted his feet in the concrete and grabbed onto Momoo's horns; he then spun it around Arlong Park, taking down several of the Arlong Pirates before hurling the sea cow into the ocean.{{Qref|chap=82|ep=38}} Luffy was unable to get his feet out of the concrete, though, forcing his crew to protect him and try to pull him out as they fought off the Arlong Pirates. Luffy attempted to punch Arlong but missed, and the fish-man tore off a chunk of the concrete that Luffy was stuck in and threw it into the pool, causing it to pull Luffy to the bottom.{{Qref|chap=83|ep=38}} Luffy could do nothing but hold his breath and could not hold it for long as he fell unconscious and started swallowing water.{{Qref|chap=84|ep=39}}

Nojiko and [[Genzo]] swam down to Luffy and pulled his head above water before taking turns holding it and pumping his chest to force the swallowed water out.{{Qref|chap=86|ep=39}} Eventually, Luffy regained consciousness, and Sanji managed to go down and destroy the concrete chunk, causing Luffy's body to fly out of the pool. Luffy pulled himself toward Arlong and punched him with a variety of attacks that inflicted minor damage.{{Qref|chap=89|ep=41}} Arlong mocked Luffy for his physical inferiority as a human and questioned what skillsets Luffy had in comparison to his crewmates; Luffy simply replied that his skillset was beating Arlong.

Arlong then attempted to bite Luffy with his powerful teeth, and Luffy tried breaking them only to find that the fish-man could instantly regrow them. Luffy knocked out multiple sets of Arlong's teeth and tried to use them as weapons,{{Qref|chap=90|ep=41|ep2=42}} but his attempt to bite Arlong did little damage due to his lesser jaw strength. Arlong responded by biting Luffy in the shoulder, but Luffy managed to dislodge the fish-man's jaw by slamming him into the ground, preventing his arm from being bitten off. Arlong then leaped at Luffy multiple times and stabbed him with his hard and sharp nose,{{Qref|chap=91|ep=42}} but Luffy was eventually able to respond by stretching his fingers into a net around Arlong and slamming him into the ground below. This attack only enraged Arlong, and he rapidly attacked Luffy with his saw-like sword [[Kiribachi]]. Arlong's attacks forced Luffy up the tower, and the fish-man eventually hit the pirate through the wall and into a room on an upper level.

Arlong revealed that this room was where Nami spent the last eight years making sea charts for him to use to take over the East Blue, and Luffy grew enraged as Arlong spoke of Nami as little more than his property. After shattering one of the blades on Kiribachi,{{Qref|chap=92|ep=42}} Luffy started destroying the equipment in the room to prevent Nami from ever going there again, knocking them through the walls and causing them to fall to the ground below. Arlong bit Luffy's neck to stop him, but Luffy grabbed his nose and snapped it out of place. He then stretched his leg up and smashed Arlong through the floor with '''Gomu Gomu no Battle Axe''', sending him crashing all the way to the ground and defeating him. The destruction caused by the attack resulted in the tower collapsing,{{Qref|chap=93|ep=43}} but Luffy emerged from the wreckage victorious and declared that Nami was now his crewmate.

Nezumi then stepped in with his men to announce that he would be taking the Arlong Pirates' money as well as the credit for their defeat, but the Straw Hats beat them up. As they swam away, Nezumi promised revenge on Luffy. Later, Luffy was with Zoro as the latter had his wound from Mihawk stitched up, and the doctor [[Nako]] recommended that they find a doctor for their crew.{{Qref|chap=94|ep=43}} The pirates and villagers then partied into the night, and Luffy encountered Genzo at a gravesite while looking for a raw ham melon. Genzo made it clear to Luffy that he would kill him if he made Nami stop smiling. On the day of departure, Johnny and Yosaku bid farewell to the Straw Hats as they resumed their lives as bounty hunters. As the Straw Hats waited for Nami to come aboard, she told them to start sailing from the back of the crowd of villagers. She then raced through the crowd and leaped onto the Merry, and Luffy laughed as she revealed that she had pickpocketed the villagers.{{Qref|chap=95|ep=44}}

===Loguetown Arc===
Nami purchased a newspaper as the Straw Hats were sailing, and the crew discovered that Luffy had received a {{B}}30,000,000 [[Bounties|bounty]] as his bounty poster slipped out of the paper. They decided it was time to head straight for the Grand Line, and came across an island known as [[Loguetown]] that was close to the entrance. Nami revealed that it was the site of the Pirate King [[Gol D. Roger|Gold Roger]]'s execution, so when the crew docked there, Luffy went to go see the execution platform.{{Qref|chap=96|ep=45}}

{{Cquote|Have you ever seen a pirate who smiled at his execution stand? He smiled the same way that the Pirate King did 22 years ago in that very same spot!|[[Smoker]] about Luffy's failed execution.}}

[[File:Buggy Executing Luffy.png|thumb|left|210px|Buggy attempts to execute Luffy.]]

Luffy reached the execution platform and climbed up it. A police officer ordered him to come down but was then attacked by Alvida, who had become much thinner after eating the [[Sube Sube no Mi]]. Alvida said that she now admired Luffy after being defeated by him, but he did not recognize her. After she revealed who she was, the Buggy Pirates then made their entrance. Buggy revealed that he had formed an alliance with Alvida to get revenge on Luffy and sentenced him to a flashy execution as Cabaji trapped Luffy by forcing him to the floor and putting a block on his neck.{{Qref|chap=98|ep=52}} Buggy asked Luffy if he had any last words, and Luffy proclaimed to the crowd that he would become the Pirate King. Zoro and Sanji arrived and attempted to rescue Luffy, but with Buggy's sword swinging toward his neck, Luffy could only smile and accept his death.

[[File:Buggy Fails To Execute Luffy.png|thumb|210px|Luffy smiling after his failed execution.]]

However, lightning then struck and destroyed the execution platform, which incapacitated Buggy but left Luffy unharmed. Zoro and Sanji then dragged him away from the approaching horde of Marines and ran back to the Merry as a thunderstorm began.{{Qref|chap=99|ep=52}} On the way, they were confronted by the Marine [[Tashigi]], and Zoro stayed behind to fight her. Marine Captain [[Smoker]] then confronted them and used his [[Moku Moku no Mi]] abilities to grab Luffy with a plume of smoke. Luffy tried attacking Smoker, but the Marine turned his body into smoke to pass through the attack before subduing Luffy. However, a mysterious wanted man known as [[Monkey D. Dragon|Dragon]] then came to stop Smoker, and a powerful gust of wind forced Smoker away from Luffy. Luffy and his crew managed to run back to the Merry and set sail. As Nami navigated the crew through the powerful storm, she told them that the entrance to the Grand Line was past the lighthouse in front of them. Sanji brought a barrel to commemorate this moment, and each of the Straw Hats proclaimed their dream while placing one foot on top of the barrel. Once each of them had done this, they destroyed the barrel and headed for the Grand Line.{{Qref|chap=100|ep=53}}

==Arabasta Saga==
===Reverse Mountain Arc===
[[Nami]] navigated the Straw Hats up the [[Reverse Mountain]] where the four [[Sea Currents|ocean currents]] converge creating an upward draft.{{Qref|chap=101|page=|ep=}} They came to an unexpected surprise, which was a gigantic whale in their way. Fortunately, Luffy was able to slow down the [[Going Merry]] before it could hit the whale by firing a cannon. However in the process, Luffy's favorite seat, the Going Merry's figurehead, was broken. Angered by this, Luffy punched the whale's eye to the shock of the rest of Luffy's crew. In response to Luffy's attack, the whale swallowed the Going Merry. Fortunately, Luffy was able to grab the whale's tooth and jump on to its back before it could swallow him along with his ship and crew. As Luffy desperately tried to persuade the whale to spit out his ship and crew, Luffy found a hatch on the whale's back leading into the very whale itself.{{Qref|chap=102|page=|ep=}}

Unable to do anything else from the outside, Luffy entered the whale through the hatch. While inside the whale, Luffy accidentally bumped into two strangely dressed people and into the whale's stomach as the whale began thrashing at the [[Red Line]]. Within the whale's stomach, Luffy was reunited with his crew and witnessed a scene between the two people he bumped into earlier and an old man living in the whale. From the scene, Luffy learned that the duo, [[Nefertari Vivi|Miss Wednesday]] and [[Mr. 9]], were planning to kill the whale for food and not even allow the old man, [[Crocus]], to stand in their way. Seeing this and Crocus' attempts to save the whale, Luffy took out the two trouble makers. For doing this, Luffy and his crew were led out of the whale by Crocus.{{Qref|chap=103|page=|ep=}}

[[File:Laboon Anime Infobox.png|thumb|left|210px|Luffy paints over Laboon's scars as a mark of their promise to meet again.]]

As Luffy's crew and ship were led out through a canal in the whale and outside to a nearby cape, Luffy and his crew were told about [[Laboon]]'s tale. From it, Luffy learned that Laboon had been waiting for over fifty years for [[Rumbar Pirates|some pirate friends of his]] who left him behind in the cape to journey the [[Grand Line]]. Luffy also learned that after Laboon heard in disbelief that the pirates might have abandon him, the whale was ramming the mountain itself in a futile attempt to reunite with them. Seeing Laboon's loyalty, Luffy decided to ease the lonely whale's pain, by ramming the Going Merry's mast into an open wound. Having caught the whale's attention, Luffy and the whale began to battle. However, in the middle of it, Luffy told Laboon that they would have to put the fight on hold since he was planning to travel the Grand Line. With this statement, Luffy touched Laboon's feelings and the whale agreed. Having given hope once again to Laboon, Luffy painted a crudely drawn painting of his Jolly Roger on Laboon's scars as a symbol of their pact to meet once again.{{Qref|chap=104|page=|ep=}}

After rekindling Laboon's hopes once again, Luffy and the rest of his crew suddenly realized that their compass was not working. With that matter at hand, Luffy and the rest were then taught by Crocus about how the Grand Line works and how they needed a special compass called a [[Log Pose]]. Having discovered one of these compasses earlier after beating the two people earlier, Luffy presented it to Nami but unfortunately broke while in a small scuffle with [[Sanji]]. Fortunately, Crocus had an extra one for Luffy and his crew to use. In the midst of what was happening, Luffy and his crew also encountered again the two people who tried to kill Laboon. Learning that these two needed to report back to the company they were working for, Luffy and the rest were requested by them to give them a ride back to their island of [[Whisky Peak]]. Though a bit suspicious, they learned that Whisky Peak is on one of the paths that the Straw Hats needed to follow to travel the Grand Line anyway. Thus, Luffy and his crew took the two aboard and sailed towards Whisky Peak, leaving Laboon with the promise of returning once again.{{Qref|chap=105|page=|ep=62|ep2=63|Luffy's interaction with Laboon and learning how the Grand Line works.}}

===Whisky Peak Arc===
Upon arriving in Whisky Peak, Luffy and his crew were caught by surprise. Though the two people that they took aboard left before they could land, Luffy and his crew were welcomed graciously by the townspeople of Whisky Peak.{{Qref|chap=106|page=|ep=}} There, Luffy and his crew were treated as gods with a grand party. Luffy even ate more than the cooks could put out. Eventually, Luffy passed out from all the excitement of such a celebratory day.{{Qref|chap=107|page=|ep=}} However when he awoke later that night, Luffy came to a shocking sight. Scattered everywhere before Luffy were the beaten up bodies of the townspeople that served him and his crew.

<div style="float:right">[[File:Luffy and Zoro Defeat Miss Valentine and Mr. 5.png|thumb|210px|Luffy and Zoro effortlessly dispatch Mr. 5 and Miss Valentine during their duel.]]</div>

Upon learning from one of them that they were defeated by [[Roronoa Zoro|Zoro]], Luffy thought that Zoro attacked them as an act of ungratefulness. Confronting Zoro, Luffy and his first crewmate collided into a battle that apparently nothing could deter them from. The two were so immersed in their battle against one another that they completely ignored and defeated two other people in same scene, [[Gem|Mr. 5]] and [[Mikita|Miss Valentine]], who were apparently distracting them for some reason. It was only when Nami stepped in and interrupted their fight that the two calmed down to listen to reason.{{Qref|chap=106|chap2=113|page=|ep=64|ep2=67|Luffy's interactions in Whisky Peak and Luffy learning about Baroque Works.}}

Luffy then learned everything that happened while he was asleep. He also learned that one of the two strangely dressed people that tried to kill Laboon before, Miss Wednesday, was actually Princess [[Nefertari Vivi]] of the kingdom of [[Arabasta]] in disguise. From her, Luffy learned that she, her pet duck [[Karoo]], and loyal retainer [[Igaram]] had infiltrated a secret criminal organization known as [[Baroque Works]] in order to learn the organization's reasons for meddling in their country's affairs. Also from Vivi, Luffy and his crew not only learned of Baroque Works' scheme to take over Arabasta but also that the criminal organization was led by none other than one of the [[Seven Warlords of the Sea]], [[Crocodile]]. Having gotten involved in all this, Luffy and his crew decided to help Vivi by taking her and Karoo to Arabasta while Igaram distracted Baroque Works with a disguise. However, in the midst of this plan, Luffy and the rest witnessed Igaram's ship engulfed in an explosion.{{Qref|chap=110|chap2=113|page=|ep=}} [[Nico Robin|Miss All Sunday]], Crocodile's partner and vice president of Baroque Works, suddenly announced herself as she sat on the Going Merry's sails. Fortunately, apart from some tense formalities between them and her, Luffy and his crew did not have to fight her as she let them go for her own reasons. Luffy and his crew were also warned by her of their next destination and even offered them an [[Nanimonai Island|alternate route]]. Luffy declined her offer despite protests from the rest of his crew.{{Qref|chap=114|page=|ep=}}

Having survived from the ordeals of Whisky Peak and gaining a mission to help a princess, Luffy and his crew sailed away from Whisky Peak to their next destination, [[Little Garden]].{{Qref|chap=115|page=|ep=67|Luffy and crew accept to help Vivi, met Miss All Sunday, and sail off to Little Garden.}}

===Little Garden Arc===

[[File:Luffy, Vivi, and Karoo Dining with Dorry.png|thumb|left|210px|Luffy, Vivi, and Karoo befriend and dine with the giant Dorry at his home.]]

Luffy and his crew eventually arrived at Little Garden. The jungle island fascinated Luffy, not only because of the adventure it could provide, but also because it contained all sorts of prehistoric animals, which ranged from saber-toothed tigers to dinosaurs. Luffy decided to venture out from their ship and explore. Vivi and Karoo decided to travel with Luffy to escape her boredom. Luffy learned that the reason the island was like this was due to the Grand Line's unique environmental conditions. The islands within in develop much more differently than they normally would, and the very island they were on was still in the dinosaur era. As Luffy ventured around the island with Vivi and Karoo, the three soon discovered something much larger than the dinosaurs on the island. In the midst of Luffy messing around with a Brontosaurus, the other members of the crew met a [[Giants|giant]].{{Qref|chap=115|page=|ep=}}

Meeting [[Dorry]], Luffy and his companions were invited over to the giant's place. There, Luffy was treated to some dinosaur meat and got acquainted with Dorry. From the giant, Luffy learned that he was staying on Little Garden in order to settle an argument with another fellow giant, [[Brogy]], in battle. As the matter was being discussed, the island's volcano erupted, signaling the next match between the giants. With it, Luffy witnessed a titanic clash between two giant warriors that awed him.{{Qref|chap=115|chap2=116|page=|ep=70|ep2=71|Luffy arrives in Little Garden and learns about the wonders there.}} Eventually, the match ended in a draw and Luffy continued talking with Dorry. Learning further about Little Garden's magnetic field from Dorry, Luffy also learned about two of his crew staying with Brogy. Just as things seemed going well at the moment, something suddenly shocked Luffy and those with him. A barrel of sake that Dorry was drinking exploded. Since the sake was taken from Luffy's ship and given to Dorry by Brogy, Luffy and his crew were suspected of sabotaging the barrel. With this, Luffy and Dorry got into a fight.{{Qref|chap=117|page=|ep=}} Fortunately, Luffy was able to knock Dorry down. However, with this sudden turn of events, Luffy started to suspect that his crew were not the only ones on the island as neither they nor Brogy would do such a thing. Before Luffy and those with him could do anything else, the volcano erupted again and Dorry got back up.{{Qref|chap=117|chap2=118|page=|ep=72|Luffy has a fight with Dorry over suspicion of sabotaging his drink.}}

With the next match being signaled and knowing that the giants' fight was tainted by someone else, Luffy tried to convince Dorry not to go. However, Luffy's words did not reach Dorry's ears due to the giant's pride and Luffy was pinned down by Dorry with the giant's home. Unable to get out of this predicament to help Dorry, Luffy suddenly encountered [[Usopp]], who had wandered into Dorry's home. Reunited with his crewmate, Luffy and Vivi recounted what had just happened and were likewise filled in by Usopp.{{Qref|chap=119|page=|ep=73|Luffy is pinned down by Dorry with the giant's home.}} As Luffy and his companions were figuring out what to do next, they heard the awful scream of Dorry being defeated by Brogy due to the tainted fight. Angered even more by this, Luffy was filled with more determination to find out who dishonored the giants' fight. Fortunately, Luffy did not have to wait long to find out who it was, as two of the perpetrators of the crime, Mr. 5 and Miss Valentine, suddenly came before Luffy and his companions, bringing a beaten up Karoo, who had separated from Luffy and Vivi at an earlier time. Because of his current predicament, Luffy was unable to aid his companions and was hit by an explosive kick caused by Mr. 5's [[Bomu Bomu no Mi]] powers. Unable to protect Vivi from these Baroque Works agents, Luffy and the other two with him were left for dead.{{Qref|chap=120|chap2=121|page=|ep=73|ep2=74|Luffy, Usopp, and Karoo are beaten down as Vivi is taken away.}}

[[File:Luffy, Usopp, and Karoo Charge In.png|thumb|210px|Enraged Luffy, Usopp and Karoo charge in to save their friends from Baroque Works.]]

As Luffy and the two with him were lying, they decided to get revenge for the atrocity caused by the Baroque Works agents. They eventually got back on their feet and charged immediately to where the Baroque Works agents were holding their friends.{{Qref|chap=121|page=|ep=}}

Luffy and company arrived and found that their friends were being made into wax statues by [[Galdino|Mr. 3]]'s [[Doru Doru no Mi]] powers.{{Qref|chap=122|page=|ep=}} Luffy engaged in a battle with the artist while his comrades battled with the rest of the agents. Despite some complications from Mr. 3 and his partner, [[Marianne|Miss Goldenweek]], Luffy was able to free his captured friends with a little help from Usopp.{{Qref|chap=122|chap2=126|page=|ep=74|ep2=76|Luffy, Usopp, and Karoo fight against Mr. 3 and the other Baroque Agents, and free their captured friends.}}

[[File:Gomu Gomu no Stamp.png|thumb|left|210px|Luffy defeats Mr. 3 after finding him among his wax copies.]]

After finishing off Mr. 3, Luffy rejoined the rest of his crew to the marvelous relief. Due to the giants' weapons being worn out from one hundred years worth of fighting, Dorry was actually okay and had instead passed out from the wound inflicted. With everything done, Luffy and the rest went back to Dorry's place to treat his wounds. As Luffy and everyone were resting from the ordeal and wondering how to deal with the island's magnetic field, they were rejoined by Sanji, who brought with him some great news. From Sanji, Luffy and the rest learned that not only did Sanji trick Crocodile into thinking they were all dead by pretending to be Mr. 3 via a [[Den Den Mushi]] call, but the cook also brought with him the solution to their current problem, an [[Eternal Pose]] to Arabasta. With the Eternal Pose, Luffy and crew bid their farewells to the giants and set off.{{Qref|chap=127|chap2=129|page=|ep=77|Luffy and crew rest from their ordeals in Little Garden and sail on.}}

As Luffy and crew sailed off from Little Garden, they were provided by the giants with an act of gratitude. With help from the giants' strength, Luffy and crew were able to pass through a giant goldfish and sail on.

===Drum Island Arc===

[[File:Vivi and Luffy Plead for the Help of a Doctor.png|thumb|240px|Vivi and Luffy plead for the help of a doctor.]]

After Nami suddenly came down with a terrible sickness, the crew decided to alter their course from Arabasta and instead look for a nearby island to have Nami treated by a [[doctor]].{{Qref|chap=130|page=|ep=}} The crew was suddenly attacked by [[Wapol]], who demanded their log pose. The crew fought back and Luffy knocked him off the ship so they could continue forward as Wapol's crew cursed them and warned them that they would get their revenge.{{Qref|chap=131|page=|ep=}} The crew eventually arrived at a snow-covered land called [[Drum Island]], which was renowned for their advances in medicine. There, the current inhabitants tried to scare away the crew until Vivi lowered her head with Luffy in humility. The "leader" of the islanders, [[Dalton]], told the villagers to take the crew to the nearest town while Zoro and Karoo stayed behind on the Going Merry.{{Qref|chap=132|page=|ep=}} At the village, Dalton told the crew about the "witch" of the island, Dr. [[Kureha]], who was the only doctor left on the island. To make matters worse, there was no way to contact her as she lived on top of the mountain in the castle previously occupied by King Wapol. Hearing this, Luffy and Sanji decided to carry Nami up the mountain to the castle.{{Qref|chap=133|page=|ep=}}

[[File:Lapahns Confronts Sanji and Luffy.png|thumb|left|210px|Luffy and [[Sanji]] beleaguered by Lapahns.]]

On the way up, Sanji, Luffy, and Nami ran into some Lapahn, which are man-eating rabbits. Sanji fought off the Lapahns as Luffy, while carrying Nami, could not attack or be hit at the risk of Nami being injured as well.{{Qref|chap=134|page=|ep=}} Later, the Lapahns caused an avalanche, forcing Luffy and Sanji to escape downhill.{{Qref|chap=135|chap2=136|page=|ep=}} Unfortunately, the group was about to run into a sharp and rocky cliff when Sanji rescued them by kicking them out of the way, but Sanji was knocked unconscious in the process. Luffy, now carrying Nami and Sanji, later saved a buried Lapahn.{{Qref|chap=137|page=|ep=}} Soon, Wapol caught up to Luffy and attacked him after Luffy showed his back to them. Unable to attack, Luffy tried to flee. However, [[Chess]] and [[Kuromarimo]] caught up and were about to strike Luffy. At that moment, a large group Lapahns saved him in repayment for Luffy saving one of them earlier.{{Qref|name=Drum|chap=138|page=|ep=}}

[[File:Luffy Protects Hiriluk's Flag.png|thumb|210px|Luffy protects [[Hiriluk]]'s flag.]]

When Luffy climbed the [[Drum Rockies|mountain]] and reached the top, he nearly fell and was rescued by [[Tony Tony Chopper|Chopper]], who then took the three pirates to Dr. Kureha.{{Qref|name=Drum}} Later, Luffy and Sanji awakened and saw Chopper for the first time. They tried to cook and eat Chopper,{{Qref|chap=139|page=|ep=}} until he turned into a giant form and smashed them down, which greatly impressed Luffy. The Straw Hat captain asked Dr. Kureha to join his crew, but she declined.{{Qref|chap=140|page=|ep=}}

Finally, Wapol arrived at the castle and began arguing with Dr. Kureha when Luffy suddenly punched him hard.{{Qref|chap=141|chap2=145|page=|ep=}} Wapol then retaliated by using his [[Baku Baku no Mi]] powers to turn into a house with cannons and fused Chess and Kuromarimo into [[Chessmarimo]]. Wapol then shot [[Hiriluk|Dr. Hiriluk]]'s [[Jolly Roger|flag]], a symbol that Chopper highly values. Wapol fired once again, but Luffy protected the flag.{{Qref|chap=147|page=|ep=}} Eventually, the fight began and Chopper started battling Chessmarimo while Luffy fought Wapol. However, Luffy was distracted by Chopper's fight (because of Chopper's ability to transform into several different forms thanks to the [[Rumble Ball]]), letting Wapol escape into the castle.{{Qref|chap=148|chap2=149|page=|ep=}}

[[File:Gomu Gomu Gomu Gomu no Bazooka.png|thumb|left|Luffy defeats Wapol with Gomu Gomu no Bazooka.]]

After Chopper won, Luffy went into the castle and kicked a now thin Wapol, who was harassing Nami. Wapol decided to open the weapons room and eat the weapons, but Nami had stolen the key. Wapol was chased up to the top of the castle, where he tried to attack using his special cannon, but it failed due to the snow birds living in there.{{Qref|chap=150|page=|ep=}} Wapol then tried to eat Luffy but was stopped so Wapol turned his tongue into a cannon for one final attack, but Luffy dodged it and sent him flying, causing Wapol to get stuck in the roof. Luffy then, ignoring Wapol's pleas for mercy and empty promises, sent him flying far away.{{Qref|chap=151|page=|ep=}}

The Straw Hats regrouped at the summit and Dalton thanked Luffy and Chopper.{{Qref|chap=152|page=|ep=}} After some persuasion, Chopper decided to go with Luffy and his crew with Dr. Kureha's blessing. As the Straw Hats left, Dr. Kureha initiated Hiriluk's finished research, a powder that makes pink colored snow fall. The Straw Hats formally welcomed Chopper to the crew and continued on to their planned destination, Arabasta.{{Qref|chap=153|page=|ep=}}

===Arabasta Arc===
====An Okama, a Brother, and a Desert Crossing====

[[File:Mr. 2 Shows His Power.png|thumb|210px|Luffy and the crew witnessing Mr. 2's ability to copy the appearances of others.]]

With Chopper on board, Luffy and his crew journeyed onward to Arabasta with Vivi and Karoo. A few days later, while fishing with Usopp and Karoo, Luffy and crew picked up something strange as they passed through the sulfuric steam of an undersea volcano. The thing they accidentally picked up was an [[okama]] known as [[Bentham|Mr. 2 Bon Kurei]]. Having passed the steam at the same time Mr. 2's ship was passing through, Luffy and his fellow fishermen accidentally hooked the Baroque Works agent.{{Qref|chap=156|page=|ep=92|Luffy and crew met Mr. 2 Bon Kurei.}}

Not initially knowing who this person was, Luffy and some of his crew immediately became friends with this flamboyant man as he put on a show for them with his [[Mane Mane no Mi]]. It was not until Mr. 2's crew came to pick him up that Luffy and his crew realized that he was an enemy. Fortunately, since Mr. 2 did not likewise know who they were, Luffy and his crew were spared at the time. However, since they were fortunate to meet such an opponent ahead of time, Luffy and his crew decided to take measures to protect themselves from his powers. Taking advice from Zoro, the crew wrapped bandages covering an X on their left wrists. This was so they could tell whether the person before them was the okama in disguise or not.

[[File:Straw Hats Saved By Ace in Arabasta.png|thumb|left|210px|Luffy and the crew being saved by his big brother Ace from Smoker.]]

Upon arriving at the port of [[Nanohana]] in Arabasta, Luffy immediately ran off ahead of his crew in search in food. Not caring for the recklessness of his actions, his search for food led him to a restaurant. In his haste to get to the restaurant, Luffy accidentally slammed two men straight through the back of the restaurant and through several houses. To his surprise, one of the men he knocked into was [[Smoker]]. Recognizing the [[Marines|Marine]], Luffy instantly ran away and was soon being chased by Smoker and his Marines all over the town. In the midst of the commotion, Luffy was saved by the other man he knocked over, his brother [[Portgas D. Ace|Ace]].{{Qref|chap=157|chap2=159|page=|ep=94|Luffy meets with Ace and Smoker again in Arabasta.}}

Regrouping with his crew back on the Going Merry, Luffy explained things to them about Ace. As Luffy was talking, Ace appeared and momentarily asked Luffy and the other Straw Hats to join the crew he was under, the [[Whitebeard Pirates]]. Though Luffy bluntly refused the offer and even stated that he would fight against Ace's captain, [[Edward Newgate]], for the position of [[Pirate#Pirate King|Pirate King]], the brothers parted ways on friendly terms. Before sailing off, Ace gave Luffy [[Vivre Card|a strange piece of paper]] so that they could meet again. Ace also aided Luffy by obliterating some Baroque Works Billions and their ships.

After sailing across the [[Sandora River]] and reaching the other side, Luffy and his crew began their journey to [[Yuba]] where Vivi hoped to persuade the rebel leader, [[Koza]], and his troops there to stop the senseless violence. Upon landing, there was a little incident where Luffy defeated and acquired 100 [[Kung-Fu Dugong]] apprentices. Though he could not bring such a large group along with him, he had formed an everlasting deep bond with the creatures. As Luffy and his crew were further explained by Vivi about the Dugongs, they passed through the once green town of [[Erumalu]] and were further enlightened regarding the problems and conspiracies facing Arabasta.{{Qref|chap=161|page=|ep=96|Luffy acquires 100 Kung-Fu Dugong apprentices and is further told about the problem in Arabasta.}}

After traversing across the huge [[Sandora Desert|desert]] of Arabasta and acquiring a new companion, [[Matsuge]] the camel, Luffy and his fellow travelers reached Yuba. There, they discovered that the town was plagued by sandstorms and deserted except for one old man. This old man, [[Toto]], was an old acquaintance of Vivi, and from him, Luffy and the others learned that the rebels had moved due to the drought and sandstorms in Yuba. Though Toto was initially hostile to Luffy's group thinking that they were people wanting to join the rebellion, he changed his attitude towards them once he recognized Vivi and offered them shelter for the night.{{Qref|chap=162|chap2=165|page=|ep=96|ep2=104|Luffy and crew's adventure through the desert and discovery in Yuba.}}

As the rest took up Toto's offer, Luffy decided to help Toto in his desperate search for water to restore the oasis of Yuba. Though slightly incapable of digging and falling asleep midway in digging, Luffy's efforts had helped Toto dig up some water. The next day as Luffy and the others prepared to travel to the rebel's new base, Luffy was given some of the water he dug up as a present from Toto. With this, Luffy and the others departed Yuba. Just as they were beginning their journey to [[Katorea]], the rebel's new base, Luffy did something that surprised the rest of them. He announced to all of them that he quit.

As Luffy's comrades asked him to stop with this seemingly childish act, he told them his reasons. He explained that even if they stopped the rebels, that would not stop Crocodile. To completely solve the matter, Luffy explained that Crocodile himself must be defeated. As Luffy surprised everyone with his insight over the entire situation, Luffy told Vivi that her desire to save everyone was naïve as people die. This little statement started an argument between the two of them, which escalated in a small fight. As Vivi explained herself and told Luffy that risking her life to save everyone was the only thing she could do, Luffy asked her why she would not risk the Straw Hats' lives as well since they were her friends. Having stated this, Luffy moved Vivi to tears with his statement of trust and friendship.

Seeing her in this state and seeing how she was the one who wanted Crocodile to be defeated, Luffy asked her where they could find him.{{Qref|chap=166|page=|ep=104|Luffy argues with Vivi and has a small fight with her.}}

====Meeting Crocodile at Rainbase====
Having understood each other, Vivi told Luffy and his crew where to find Crocodile, [[Rainbase]]. Regardless of the fact that Officer Agents would be waiting there, Luffy and his group pressed forward to confront the Warlord. Upon arriving at Rainbase, Luffy and Usopp were sent by the rest to ask for some much needed water after much journeying in the desert island. However, upon finding water in a bar, the two accidentally encountered Smoker and [[Tashigi]]. Soon enough, another large commotion was caused with Luffy and his crew being chased all around by the Marines. However, Luffy and some of his crew managed to escape from the pursuing Marines and headed into Crocodile's casino, [[Rain Dinners]].{{Qref|chap=167|chap2=169|page=|ep=105|ep2=106|Luffy and crew travel to and arrive at Rainbase.}}

Though Luffy and his crewmates with him managed to get into the casino, they entered without Vivi to help them identify what Crocodile really looked like. To make matters worse, Smoker had caught up with them and started chasing them all around the casino. As they were running around, Luffy and those with him were tricked into falling through a trap door by the casino staff. Having fallen for the trick, Luffy and the others, including Smoker, found themselves trapped in a [[seastone]] cage. As they were pondering their current predicament, they were greeted by Crocodile.

[[File:Luffy Meets Crocodile.png|thumb|210px|Luffy, his crew, and Smoker captured by Crocodile.]]

Having finally met the one who orchestrated the whole mess in Arabasta, Luffy and the others with him were unable to do anything because of the cage they were in. As the situation developed with Vivi being brought before Crocodile by Miss All Sunday and the powers of the Devil Fruit Crocodile ate, the [[Suna Suna no Mi]], were revealed, Luffy and the rest learned of Crocodile's awful master plan as he mockingly explained it before them. As it went further, Luffy and the others found themselves being placed in a little game the Warlord decided to challenge Vivi in.{{Qref|chap=172|chap2=173|page=|ep=107|ep2=108|Luffy and the others with him are placed in a dangerous challenge by Crocodile for Vivi.}}

Due to events being carried out, Luffy and the rest needed to get to [[Alubarna]], the capital of Arabasta, fast in order to stop the upcoming war. However, because of Luffy and those with him being stuck in a cage, Vivi would have to get the key that Crocodile presented and threw into a pit, where it was eaten by a [[Bananawani]]. Explaining further that he decided to flood the room they were in, Crocodile presented Vivi the choice between getting to Alubarna in time or saving Luffy and those with him before the room completely floods. As Crocodile was explaining this challenge to Vivi, Luffy overheard Toto being mentioned by the Warlord and soon learned that it was Crocodile that was causing the sandstorms that plagued Yuba.

Angered by Crocodile's cruelty, Luffy urged Vivi to get the key so that he and the rest can beat Crocodile. Despite Luffy's encouragement, a single Bananawani proved too much for Vivi. Though all seems lost, Luffy and everyone heard a Den Den Mushi ring amidst the ensuing chaos.

Recognizing Sanji's voice calling from the Den Den Mushi, Luffy and the others realized that there was still hope as Sanji and Chopper weren't captured. As events unfolded with this new development, Luffy and the rest found themselves depending on Vivi finding someone from the outside to get them out. In an attempt to free themselves, Luffy and the others tried to coax one of the Bananawani into biting open the cage. Though their attempt at breaking the cage through this failed, their hopes were however revived as Sanji finally showed up at the scene. With him, the key that Crocodile was found alongside a familiar foe, Mr. 3. Though the Baroque Works agent that came out of the Bananawani threw the key, Luffy and the others with him were however still able to escape the cage via Mr. 3's wax powers. Escaping just in the nick of time, Luffy and the others were able to get out. As the room flooded and they escaped, Luffy told Zoro to grab Smoker along with them.{{Qref|chap=174|chap2=176|page=|ep=108|ep2=109|Luffy and the others with him are saved by "Mr. Prince" in Rain Dinners.}}

Having saved the Marine, Luffy and his companions were allowed to go free to get Alubarna. As they were thinking of a way to get to Alubarna fast they were greeted by Chopper who brought [[Hasami]], a giant crab friend of Matsuge whom they can ride on. However just as they were getting aboard, Vivi was literally hooked by Crocodile. Fortunately, Luffy freed her just in time as she was taken away. With Vivi safe, Luffy told his crew to go on as he faced off the Warlord by himself.
As Luffy prepared to face Crocodile, he was told that the Warlord would humor him for three minutes. After that, Crocodile would leave for Alubarna to complete his scheme. With the time limit in mind, Luffy fought ferociously against his opponent. Though he attacked the best he could, it was however apparent that no matter how much Luffy attacked, he could not damage Crocodile.

As they continued to fight one another, Luffy's arm was dehydrated by Crocodile. Using the water given by Toto however, Luffy was able to restore himself. Remembering the old man, Luffy declares that no matter how much Crocodile attacks Yuba with sandstorms, it will never be destroyed. As Luffy declared this, his three minutes were up.{{Qref|chap=176|chap2=178|page=|ep=110|Luffy fights with Crocodile in the desert.}}

As the three minutes ended, Luffy witnessed Crocodile decide to do something horrible. Spurred on by Luffy, Crocodile created a massive sandstorm and sent it towards Yuba. Seeing this new development, Luffy desperately tried to stop Crocodile. Unfortunately in midst of all this, Luffy was impaled by the Warlord and left for dead in the sand.

Despite being heavily wounded and buried in the sand however, Luffy still struggled with the will to fight. As he struggled, in a surprise turn of events Luffy was suddenly pulled out by Miss All Sunday. Having been pulled out from his sandy grave, Luffy was left in the care of [[Pell]], the hero of Arabasta that the Baroque Works agent defeated awhile back.{{Qref|chap=180|page=|ep=111|Luffy rescued by Miss All Sunday and left with Pell.}}

====Battling Crocodile for the 2nd and 3rd Time====
With Pell's help, Luffy was able to recover from his wounds and get a ride to Alubarna via Pell's Devil Fruit, the [[Tori Tori no Mi, Model: Falcon]]. Through various events that happened in the city, by the time that the two arrived at Alubarna, a great battle was being waged by the rebels and the royal army in the city square with a sandstorm covering the place. As they arrived, they got just in time to save Vivi, who was dropped by Crocodile from the palace walls. With Vivi safe, Luffy flung himself up the walls to face Crocodile again.{{Qref|chap=198|chap2=201|page=|ep=121|ep2=122|Luffy saves Vivi and fights Crocodile again.}}

[[File:Luffy Defeated by Crocodile at Alubarna Palace.png|thumb|left|210px|Luffy dehydrated and defeated by Crocodile once again at the palace.]]

During his previous fight, Luffy noticed that water made Crocodile unable to turn into sand as he and the water barrel that Toto gave were pierced by Crocodile's hook. Realizing this, he brought a huge barrel of water to aid him in his rematch against the Warlord. As Luffy thus fought Crocodile again, he soon realized that his barrel of water could easily be jeopardized. Figuring this out, Luffy decided to switch tactics by drinking all of his water and storing it within himself, essentially become what he dubbed "Mizu Luffy". While this new tactic infuriated his opponent, it however proved effective for Luffy. Though Luffy was aided greatly by water this time around, the fight however just made his opponent really mad.

Having landed some good hits on Crocodile and angering the Warlord as well, Luffy had incurred the Warlord to use his most powerful technique. Though Luffy was able to evade Crocodile's devastating powers of erosion, he unfortunately got caught by his opponent. As Crocodile's hand held Luffy, he was severely dehydrated and was once again left for dead. Fortunately however, some water bubbles that Luffy misfired earlier revived him from his near death state. Rejuvenated once again, Luffy set off in search of his foe. Learning from Tashigi while on his search, Luffy headed to royal Arabasta tomb.{{Qref|chap=202|chap2=204|page=|ep=123|ep2=124|Luffy searches for Crocodile once again.}}

As he ran, the wound from his chest unfortunately opened, and Luffy, feeling unusually faint, briefly fell unconscious. Recovering himself, Luffy noticed a passageway and ran down into the tomb. Eventually Luffy caught up with his foe once again in the collapsing ruins. Encountering each other, the two fought each other again, however having been severely wounded from his previous matches with Crocodile, Luffy used his own bloody body to negate Crocodile's powers this time around.

[[File:Luffy Defeats Crocodile With Gomu Gomu no Storm.png|thumb|210px|Luffy finally defeats Crocodile with '''Gomu Gomu no Storm'''.]]

As the climatic battle between Luffy and Crocodile commenced, Luffy was struck by Crocodile's poison hook. This however did not deter Luffy's resolve against his opponent. As the battle continued, Luffy kicked Crocodile into the air. Upon doing so, Luffy was blasted with one of Crocodile's powerful techniques. Luffy however withstood the attack and prepared to retaliate. Using a series of moves, Luffy propelled himself up to Crocodile to deliver the final blow. As a last resort, Crocodile tried to stop Luffy by turning his hand into blades.

This however did not stop Luffy as he broke through the sand created weapons with his bare fist and delivered a flurry of punches onto his opponent.{{Qref|chap=204|chap2=210|page=|ep=124|ep2=126|Luffy battles Crocodile for the third time and finally defeats him.}} Delivering the punches, Luffy attacked Crocodile with such force that it penetrated a layer of pure bedrock and sent Crocodile flying, defeating the Warlord finally. Falling back into the ruins, Luffy was thanked by [[Nefertari Cobra]] for all he had done.

After being given the vial of antidote to Crocodile's poison from Miss All Sunday, Luffy mustered what was left of his strength to carry both the king and the former Baroque Works agent out of the ruins. Having used the last of his strength, Luffy was then carried by the king to his crew.{{Qref|chap=211|chap2=218|page=|ep=127|ep2=130|Luffy saves Cobra and Nico Robin from the royal tomb before collapsing.}}

====Farewell to Arabasta and Vivi====
For their valiant heroism in saving Arabasta, Luffy and his crew were treated secretly as VIPs by the royalty for three days. Having fully recovered from his wounds from the battle with Crocodile on the third day, Luffy and his crew decided to leave before the awaiting Marines could catch them. Just as they were heading back to the Going Merry which was secured by Mr. 2 Bon Kurei before the Marines could find it, Luffy and the others offered Vivi the choice of joining the crew. They gave her until noon the next day.{{Qref|chap=213|page=|ep=128|Luffy and his crew are treated by the Arabastan royalty in secret.}}

[[File:Straw Hat Friendship X Mark.png|thumb|left|210px|Luffy and the crew showing their X mark of camaraderie as a silent farewell to Vivi.]]

Setting sail with the reformed Bon Kurei and his men the next day, Luffy and his crew encountered the blockade the Marines set up to capture them. Through a tearful sacrifice by Mr. 2, Luffy and his crew were able to escape the blockade to go to the rendezvous point to pick up Vivi. Arriving there, they found that Vivi had come as promised. However to their disappointment, she told them that she still had responsibilities as Arabasta's princess and could not come along. Despite this, Vivi asked them that if they ever meet again, would she be accepted to come along again.{{Qref|chap=214|chap2=216|page=|ep=129|Luffy and his crew leave Arabasta and show Vivi their sign of friendship.}}

While Luffy and the others wanted to reply out loud to Vivi that she would still be accepted, they could not out of fear that the nearby Marines would implicate her as a criminal. Instead however, they quietly showed her the mark that they used to protect themselves if Mr. 2 impersonated one of them, a sign of their friendship. Having delivered their silent response to their friend, Luffy and his crew set sail away from Arabasta and onto their next adventure.

Though depressed about not having Vivi on the crew, Luffy and the other came across a new development. Nico Robin, a.k.a. Miss All-Sunday from Baroque Works, had stowed away on the Going Merry and demanded Luffy take responsibility of saving her by letting her join his crew. Without much hesitation, Luffy agreed much to everyone's surprise.

==Sky Island Saga==
===Jaya Arc===
====A Sunken Ship and a Lawless Town====
Not long after Luffy and the Straw Hats left Arabasta, a massive ship fell from the sky and into the sea. From Nico Robin and a brief search of the sinking ship which wielded a map, Luffy and his crew learned that the ship fell from an island in the sky called [[Skypiea]].{{Qref|chap=217|chap2=219|page=|ep=130|ep2=131|Luffy and crew get Nico Robin in their ranks and learn of Skypiea as well.}}

[[File:Luffy Finds Shiro Mokuba I.png|thumb|210px|Luffy exploring the sunken [[St. Briss]].]]

Needing more info on the matter, Luffy and his crew decided to explore more of the ship. Using special diving suits created by Usopp, Luffy, along with Zoro and Sanji, explored the sunken ship. As they explored the ship and found few things, their search was cut short as the ship was suddenly clamped and filled with air, and a bunch of other people appeared. After taking care of the intruders within the newly created air pocket, the three encountered [[Masira|a monkey-like person]] bursting into the room. Although Luffy and the stranger initially got along, they unfortunately got on bad terms when they found out that they were after the same thing.{{Qref|chap=219|chap2=220|page=|ep=144|Luffy, Zoro, and Sanji explore the St. Bliss.}}

Fortunately with thanks from his two crewmates, Luffy escaped from Masira and a giant turtle that ate the ship at the same time. As Luffy and the others were about to deal with this new foe, they suddenly witnessed something that completely scared them, the shadowy silhouettes of creatures several times larger than regular giants. After escaping from the creatures and getting rid of Masira who accidentally tagged along, Luffy and his crew learned of [[Jaya]] from an [[Eternal Pose]] that Robin stole from the guy. Needing info on how to get to Skypiea, Luffy and his crew sailed for Jaya.{{Qref|chap=221|page=|ep=145|Luffy and his crew escape from what appeared to be shadowy creatures bigger than giants.}}

[[File:Luffy Meets Blackbeard.png|thumb|left|210px|Luffy's arguing with a [[Marshall D. Teach|certain bar customer]] during their first encounter.]]

Arriving at Jaya at the port of [[Mock Town]], Luffy and his crew found that the place they landed on was a lawless town filled with pirates. Wanting to explore the town as well as get information, Luffy, along with [[Roronoa Zoro|Zoro]] and [[Nami]], went offshore into town. With a promise not to fight while in Mock Town to Nami, the three explored the place and encountered several of the inhabitants. They eventually end up in a bar wherein Luffy has a small argument with another [[Marshall D. Teach|customer]]. Though the incident ended without a hitch, Luffy and his companions encountered a much more serious one.

Luffy and his companions soon encountered in the bar [[Bellamy]] and his [[Bellamy Pirates|crew]] with the intention of seeing if Luffy was worthy of joining his "New Age" of pirates. However upon learning that Luffy and his crew wanted to go to a Sky Island, Bellamy along with the rest of the bar started ridiculing them and the notion of dreams such as a Sky Island. Though the situation got worse with Luffy and Zoro taking hits from Bellamy's crew, they however refused to fight. As the two were dragged out by a frustrated Nami, the three were congratulated and encouraged by the pirate that Luffy argued with earlier. Though the man assured them that dreams would never die, Luffy and Zoro however sense something up with him and the people that are apparently associated with him.{{Qref|chap=222|chap2=226|page=|ep=146|ep2=147|Luffy, Zoro, and Nami's search in Mock Town.}}

Returning to the Going Merry, Luffy and the others soon learn that while their search was unproductive, Robin's was successful. Learning that a man by the name of [[Mont Blanc Cricket]] might know something, they headed off to the other side of Jaya.{{-}}

====The Saruyama Alliance and Knock Up Stream====

[[File:Luffy Befriends Masira and Shoujou.png|thumb|210px|Luffy getting acquainted with Masira and Shoujou while Cricket recovers.]]

After escaping a brief encounter with Masira's brother, [[Shoujou]], Luffy and his crew reached Cricket's home. There they had a brief misunderstanding with Cricket who they found out apparently suffered from decompression sickness. However upon helping Cricket and clearing things with him, Luffy and his crew were able to get better acquainted with the former pirate. For helping Cricket, they were also able to reconcile with Cricket's proteges, Masira and Shoujou.{{Qref|chap=226|page=|ep=147|Luffy and crew evade Shoujou.}}

As they explained their problem and got acquainted with Cricket and his proteges, Luffy and his crew learned of Cricket's past and [[Mont Blanc Noland|his ancestor]]. Showing interest with Cricket's dream, Luffy and his crew convinced Cricket to help them out in getting to Skypiea. While having acquired help from someone who could aid them in getting to Skypiea, Luffy and his crew however found out that they needed an important thing to aid them, the [[South Bird]]. This bird as explained to them by Cricket, was needed to find a [[Knock Up Stream]] needed to help them get to Skypiea. Having been told this, Luffy and his crew quickly went in search for the bird.{{Qref|chap=227|chap2=230|page=|ep=148|ep2=149|Luffy and crew get acquainted with the Saruyama Alliance.}}

Splitting into various groups, Luffy and his crew searched the nearby forest for one of these elusive birds. Though they encountered all sorts of obstacles and antics while searching for the bird, they were able to catch one in the end thanks to Robin. With the captured bird, they went back to Cricket's. Upon returning however, they discovered the horrid aftermath of an incident that happened while they were away, Cricket and his proteges were defeated and had been robbed by Bellamy and his crew.{{Qref|chap=230|chap2=231|page=|ep=149|ep2=150|Luffy and crew find a South Bird and discover the defeated Saruyama Alliance.}}

[[File:Luffy Defeats Bellamy at Mock Town.png|thumb|left|210px|Luffy defeating Bellamy with a single punch for stealing Cricket's gold.]]

Spurred on by this, Luffy decided to go after Bellamy and get his wounded friends' gold back. At Mock Town, Luffy was engaged by Bellamy who wanted to prove once and for all to those around him that Luffy and Cricket's dreams were nothing. Despite Bellamy's over the top display of his [[Bane Bane no Mi|Devil Fruit]] ability, Luffy however defeated the arrogant pirate with a single normal punch. Having completely obliterated Bellamy in front of his crew and the other pirates, Luffy was able to retrieve Cricket's gold without any further trouble.{{Qref|chap=232|chap2=233|page=|ep=151|Luffy completely defeats Bellamy.}}

As the morning of the next day came, Luffy arrived back to Cricket's house. There he saw the newly modified Going Merry as he gave Cricket's gold back. With the new modifications for the trip up to Skypiea and the South Bird, Luffy and crew set sail with the ships of Masira and Shoujou escorting them. As they were leaving, Luffy and his crew were cheered on by Cricket's final words of encouragement. With that, Luffy and crew sailed off to where they could ride a Knock up Stream.{{Qref|chap=235|chap2=236|page=|ep=152|Luffy and crew ride the Knock Up Stream.}}

After a long wait out on sea, the weather and the sea started to show signs of a Knock Up Stream. As Luffy and his crew were preparing themselves for the journey to Skypiea, they suddenly encountered the ship and crew of [[Marshall D. Teach|the pirate that Luffy fought with in the bar]]. From this encounter, Luffy and his crew learned of his and Zoro's new bounties for which the pirate planned on collecting. The encounter however was brief as the Knock Up Stream started. With the Knock Up Stream shooting the Going Merry into the sky, Luffy and his crew set forth to new adventure as well inadvertently escaping from the pursuing pirate.

===Skypiea Arc===
====Adventure and Trouble 10,000 Meters in the Air====
The crew ended up floating on the cloud after passing through it, and as they took in their surroundings, Usopp decided to take a swim in the clouds. When he did not resurface, the Straw Hats realized he was falling all the way to the Blue Sea and Luffy quickly stretched his arm down to try and save him. Robin sprouted eyes on Luffy's arm, allowing her to see where Usopp was and generate arms off of Luffy's to grab him. When Luffy pulled Usopp back up, a giant, balloon-like octopus followed him, though Zoro easily dealt with it. As the crew recovered from this experienced, they were suddenly assaulted by a masked guerrilla warrior who landed powerful blows on Luffy, Zoro, and Sanji. However, the "Knight of the Sky" [[Gan Fall]] then came flying in on his bird-horse [[Pierre]] and fought off the warrior before introducing himself to the Straw Hats.{{Qref|chap=237|ep=153}} After learning about what the Straw Hats did to get here, Gan Fall gifted them a free whistle to call him should they be attacked by someone again, and then departed. With the crew unsure as to how to keep sailing upward to the Log Pose's destination, Luffy tried to blow the whistle but was stopped by Nami. The crew then came across a cloud waterfall, and Luffy found that the clouds around it were hard enough to stand and bounce on. Upon climbing up the bouncy cloud, Luffy, Usopp, and Chopper found that behind the waterfall was a path. At the end of the path the Straw Hats came to Heaven's Gate, where the gatekeeper [[Amazon]] charged them 1 billion [[extols]] for entry. The Straw Hats only had belly and were unsure how to convert it, but Amazon then told them that they could pass through without paying. When they did, the Merry was suddenly seized by Speedy Shrimp which took it and the Straw Hats on a winding path to the country of [[Skypiea]] up above.{{Qref|chap=238|ep=153}}

Upon reaching the sea at the end of the path, the Straw Hats found themselves at the coast of Angel Island, a place founded on top of clouds, and Luffy immediately disembarked to explore it. As Luffy examined the various elements on the island, the Straw Hats met a young native girl named [[Conis]] as well as her father [[Pagaya]].{{Qref|chap=239|ep=154}} Luffy rode Pagaya's [[waver]] around the sea but ended up losing control and falling in, forcing Zoro and Sanji to rescue him. Nami then tried out the waver and was much better at it, and Pagaya and Conis took the rest of the Straw Hats to their home. There, Conis explained the abilities of [[Dials]], which powered wavers among other things.{{Qref|chap=240|ep=154}} At that point, Nami was no longer in sight, and Conis became worried that she had wandered over to [[Upper Yard]], the home of Skypiea's "God" [[Enel]] which was forbidden for all to enter. This made Luffy very interested in it, and the crew decided to go and rescue Nami if she was in any trouble. The group went back down to the coast, and before the Straw Hats set off Pagaya examined their old waver.{{Qref|chap=241|ep=155}}

Suddenly, [[McKinley]] and the [[White Berets]] came marching in and confronted Luffy to charge him and the Straw Hats for illegal entry. They explained the punishment was just a fine of ten times the original entry fee, but after learning the value of extols compared to belly, the crew realized that it would be an exorbitant amount. Nami then returned to the coast on Pagaya's waver, and after learning about the charges she hit McKinley with the waver in anger. Because of this, McKinley increased the charges against the Straw Hats to be punished by execution by [[Cloud Drifting]], and Luffy confronted the White Berets with the intention of fighting. After dodging the Sky Arrows they shot, Luffy pulled against a palm tree and spun himself around, allowing him to wildly attack the force with punches and kicks and take out most of them at once. Zoro and Sanji came ashore to finish the job, and McKinley then proclaimed that due to their crimes, the Straw Hats would be judged by God's priests themselves.{{Qref|chap=242|ep=156}}

With this news, the Straw Hats bid farewell to Conis and Pagaya and prepared to try to leave Skypiea through [[Cloud End]] to the best of their ability. However, as Luffy, Usopp, and Sanji went inside the duo's house to get food, a Super-Express Speedy Shrimp then arrived and carried off the Merry. Pagaya revealed to the trio that their crewmates were being taken to the Sacrificial Altar on Upper Yard where they would be held as hostages; it would be up to the trio to take the [[Milky Road]] to Upper Yard and face the trials there in order to rescue the rest of the crew.{{Qref|chap=243|ep=157}} Conis took Luffy, Usopp, and Sanji down Lovely Street to the port, where she gave them her small boat [[Karasumaru]]. Luffy noticed that Conis had been pale and shaking since they had left her house and asked if she was scared. After some hesitation, Conis broke down and revealed that she was the one who called the Speedy Shrimp that took away their crewmates, as failing to turn in criminals was punishable by death. Luffy, Usopp, and Sanji were not angry at her for doing this, instead wondering why she risked her life to reveal it to them. Suddenly, sparks rose in the air, and Luffy quickly grabbed Conis and jumped away right as Enel struck the spot where Conis was standing with a giant thunderbolt. The attack left a gaping hole in the port that Luffy and Conis fell into, but luckily Gan Fall came flying in to save them. Gan Fall took Conis away to a safe area as Luffy, Usopp, and Sanji set sail for Upper Yard.{{Qref|chap=244|ep=158}}

====The Trials of Upper Yard====

[[File:Luffy, Usopp, and Sanji vs. Satori.png|thumb|210px|Luffy, Usopp and Sanji vs. Satori.]]

As the trio entered the heavily forested place, they quickly had to contend with large swinging blades threatening to pulverize them, as well as a giant sky lamprey eel. After making it past those obstacles, they arrived at four gateways, each one leading to a different [[Ordeals|Ordeal]].{{Qref|chap=245|ep=159}} Luffy wanted to go to the Ordeal of Balls since it sounded the most fun, and so the trio went through that gate. After being dropped off a cliff, they landed back on the Milky Road and found themselves surrounded by large floating balls made of island cloud. However, when playing with one of the balls, Luffy and Usopp were assaulted by a snake that burst out of it, and Sanji tried hitting away an incoming ball only for it to explode. The trio were then confronted by [[Satori]], one of Enel's four priests, who introduced them to his "Surprise Balls" and said they had to defeat him to continue on to the Sacrificial Altar. Luffy attempted to punch Satori, but the priest easily dodged him before striking him with an [[Impact Dial]], which unleashed a powerful blow against him that caused internal damage. Satori sent Luffy, Sanji, and Usopp off the Karasumaru with his Impact Dial strikes, and revealed that the boat would keep moving and leave them behind in his forest if they did not defeat him in time.{{Qref|chap=246|ep=160}}

Luffy aimed another punch at Satori, but the priest grabbed his arm after dodging it and slammed him into a tree. Luffy then tried attacking Satori with '''Gomu Gomu no Gatling Gun''', but this failed to hit Satori and instead struck several Surprise Balls, causing the Straw Hats to be assaulted by their contents. Luffy was sent falling toward one of the cloud rivers and saved himself by grabbing a vine, though ended up having fun swinging on it and became distracted. Eventually, Sanji got him off the vine and beat him up, but Satori then struck Sanji with an Impact Dial.{{Qref|chap=247|ep=160|ep2=161}} Satori proceeded to overwhelm the entire trio before assaulting them with his Ball Dragon, which would cause a massive chain reaction if a particular ball in its chain was set off. However, Luffy found the string Satori was using to control the Dragon and broke it. Satori responded by pulling the rope to bring Luffy to him; however, Luffy did not let go of the Ball Dragon and sent it crashing into Satori. The priest managed to avoid the massive explosion, but Luffy avoided it as well by hanging onto his back. Luffy then wrapped his arm's around Satori's body, rendering him immobile and preventing him from dodging their attacks, allowing Sanji to give Satori a powerful kick to the head and defeat him.{{Qref|chap=250|ep=163}} Immediately afterward, Usopp called to Luffy and Sanji that he had found the Karasumaru and told them to come to him quickly. Once they did, Usopp shot a rope from his belt that successfully wrapped around the boat and pulled them up to it, but they ended up hitting several trees on the way up. As the Karasumaru sailed out of the forest, the trio lay dazed on it.{{Qref|chap=251|ep=164}}

Some time later, Luffy, Usopp, and Sanji sailed through a field dotted with skulls. A group of [[Shandia]] guerrillas then came flying past them, and their leader, [[Wyper]], fired a bazooka shot at the trio. Luffy deflected it with '''Gomu Gomu no Fusen''', and Wyper chose not to attack further, but warned the Straw Hats that he would treat them like Enel if they caused trouble on the island. The trio continued sailing and made it to the Sacrificial Altar by sunset, where they reunited with the rest of the crew. After checking on the injured Gan Fall, the Straw Hats decided to camp out on Upper Yard for the night. After setting up the campsite, the crew talked about their discovery that the lost city of gold that Noland was looking for was here on Upper Yard, and decided to hunt for the gold the next day.{{Qref|chap=252|ep=165}} The crew then gathered food and supplies for the next day, and Luffy was put in charge of overseeing the boiling of water for drinking. As the Straw Hats ate some stew, they talked about clues to finding the city from Noland's logbook. Afterwards, Robin said the crew should put out the fire to avoid attracting attention from enemies, but Luffy and Usopp opposed this. Despite Robin's and Nami's warnings, the crew built a giant bonfire and danced around it before going to bed.{{Qref|chap=253|ep=166}}

====Hunting for Treasure and Eaten by a Snake====
The next morning, Usopp showed the crew that repairs to the Merry somehow happened overnight, which he claimed to be the work of [[Klabautermann|a spirit]]. The crew then split into two teams to head to the lost city, with Luffy, Zoro, Chopper, and Robin forming the "Explore Team" that would head to the city on foot.{{Qref|chap=254|ep=167}} The quartet's expedition had just started when they ran into a giant snake named [[Nola]]. Luffy told the group to run away from it, and they became scattered as the snake attempted to attack them with its poisonous fangs. Luffy tried to lure Nola toward him, and ended up being separated from the rest of the group. He remembered the direction to go south, but had no idea which way south was and went in a straight line southwest.{{Qref|chap=255|ep=168}} He became interested upon hearing the bleating of what sounded like a goat, and when a Shandia warrior tried to ambush him, Luffy quickly beat the warrior aside, being annoyed that he was not a goat. Luffy then ran into Wyper, who asked him what he was doing on Upper Yard still.{{Qref|chap=257|ep=169}}

[[File:Luffy vs. Wyper.png|thumb|left|210px|Luffy vs. Wyper.]]

Wyper told Luffy that Upper Yard belonged to his people, the Shandia, and Luffy accepted this and walked off. However, Wyper had had enough of Luffy and so decided to eliminate him, and Luffy was very willing to fight back.{{Qref|chap=258|ep=169}} Wyper shot Luffy with eight bazooka shots, all of which Luffy deflected; Wyper then changed his strategy and fired a stream of natural gas at Luffy before using his [[Burn Bazooka]] to create disintegrating white flames. Luffy managed to dodge the sudden burst of fire, and traded blows with Wyper in midair. Wyper then readied another Burn Bazooka strike against him, and Luffy responded by attacking him with '''Gomu Gomu no Bazooka'''. The two's attacks hit the other simultaneously, causing a notable amount of injury to both of them.{{Qref|chap=260|ep=171}} Wyper then called out to Luffy to see if he was still alive, and Luffy responded, but he was then suddenly eaten by Nola and fell through its insides before landing among some ruins.{{Qref|chap=261|ep=171}}

Thinking he was inside a cave, Luffy examined the treasures in the ruins while walking further down Nola's stomach. He came to a dead end and tried striking it with Gomu Gomu no Bazooka to see if there was a secret door, which caused Nola to spin around.{{Qref|chap=266|ep=175}} Nola ate some sea clouds which almost drowned Luffy, and the pirate continued hitting the walls of its stomach which caused the snake to rampage through Upper Yard in pain.{{Qref|chap=267|ep=175}} Nola's movements while fighting in the Upper Ruins of [[Shandora]] caused Luffy to constantly fall through its stomach as it repositioned, leaving him aghast as to what kind of cave this was. Luffy then attempted to dig his way out of the stomach, causing Nola to laugh.{{Qref|chap=269|ep=176}} However, he was then joined by Nami, Gan Fall, Pierre, and Aisa after they had been eaten by Nola, and they revealed to him that this cave was the snake's stomach.{{Qref|chap=271|ep=177}} Nami decided to ride her waver out of the snake through its mouth, and Luffy hung onto the back of the waver while Aisa hung onto him. However, the exhaust fumes of the waver blew Luffy and Aisa off of it, and they fell back down to Nola's stomach; however, Pierre quickly returned to rescue them.{{Qref|chap=273|ep=179}} Nola was knocked unconscious by a thunderbolt from Enel, and Luffy, Aisa, and Pierre traveled up to its head. Luffy ended up behind its left eye and opened its eyelid, but was quickly guided down to its mouth. They jarred the snake's mouth open and fell down to the ground below, where they found themselves in Shandora, the legendary city of gold. However, Luffy and Aisa then found Zoro, Chopper, Robin, Gan Fall, and Wyper laying unconscious next to a giant hole in the ground. A barely conscious Robin told Luffy that Enel had done this and was plotting to destroy all of Skypiea; he had taken Nami away to an unknown place. Robin believed that Enel would go to the fabled Golden Bell first, and when Aisa sensed the presence of two people with her [[Haki/Kenbunshoku Haki|Mantra]], Luffy told the young girl to take him there.{{Qref|chap=277|ep=181}}

====Fighting a God====

[[File:Luffy Kicks Enel.png|thumb|Luffy vs. Enel.]]

Aisa guided Luffy to a cave near the city ruins, and Luffy confronted Enel, who was with Nami on the giant ship [[Ark Maxim]].{{Qref|chap=278|ep=182}} Luffy pulled himself up to the ship's deck, and Enel struck him with a mighty thunderbolt. However, due to Luffy's body being made of rubber, a natural insulator to lightning, the attack had no effect on him. Enel was left stunned and Luffy charged toward him, successfully punching Skypiea's God in the stomach as his rubber body bypassed Enel's Logia defenses.{{Qref|chap=279|ep=182}} When Enel got up from the attack, Luffy tried attacking him again, but the God used his Mantra to dodge Luffy's attacks and hit the pirate with his staff. Enel used his electricity to reshape his staff into a trident, and Luffy struggled to avoid being stabbed by it. After managing to dodge one of Enel's attacks in midair, Luffy was able to kick him into the floor. However, Enel was able to grab Luffy's arms on his follow-up attack and slam him into the floor as well, and he proceeded to activate the Ark Maxim to bring it up into the air.{{Qref|chap=280|ep=183}} Luffy watched in anger as Enel used the Maxim to generate a giant thundercloud he called '''Deathpiea''' to wreak destruction on Skypiea, and the two then resumed sparring. In an attempt to work around Enel's Mantra, Luffy shut off his mind and dodged Enel's strikes purely on reflex, though quickly went back to normal since he could not attack in that diminished mental state. Luffy then got another idea and ran toward Enel's throne chamber, which was surrounded by a curved wall. He threw rapid punches at the wall, and those punches ricocheted back and struck Enel, who could not anticipate their randomness. With Enel reeling from those attacks, he was powerless to stop Luffy from pummeling him with direct attacks.{{Qref|chap=281|ep=183}}

[[File:Luffy Trapped By Gloam Paddling.png|thumb|left|Luffy's hand is stuck inside the golden ball Enel created.]]

Luffy watched as the injured Enel slowly got up and cursed him for messing with his plans, but as Luffy moved to attack him further, Enel quickly responded by reshaping the gold from the wall behind him and forming it into a giant ball around Luffy's right forearm. With Luffy unable to pull his arm out of it, Enel kicked the ball and sent it rolling off the edge of the Maxim; Luffy tried holding onto the ledge, but Enel sent him falling to the ground far below with his staff. Aisa and Pierre tried to fly in to rescue Luffy, but Enel attacked them with a lightning bolt.{{Qref|chap=282|ep=184}} The three of them fell down into a chasm, where Luffy had rubble fall on him though he remained unharmed. After pulling himself out, he prepared to follow the Ark Maxim to the place where the Golden Bell was.{{Qref|chap=283|ep=185}} Aisa took Luffy to the giant beanstalk [[Giant Jack]], which the Ark Maxim was circling near high above, and Robin was there, revealing that the Golden Bell was up at the top of it. Luffy then ran up Giant Jack with his golden ball in tow, intent on freeing Nami, Usopp, and Sanji and fighting Enel.{{Qref|chap=285|ep=186}} Once he made it close to the top of Giant Jack, Luffy was noticed by Enel, who fired a lightning bolt to break off the top of the beanstalk and send Luffy falling. Luffy was able to grab back onto Giant Jack and pull himself onto the highest cloud platform on it, and right then he was suddenly struck by Nami, who had rode her waver up Giant Jack to fetch him. After watching Enel destroy all of Angel Island with a giant thundercloud called '''Raigo''', Nami told Luffy that Usopp and Sanji had escaped the Ark Maxim and that he needed to go back to the Merry with her so they could escape. However, Luffy told her that he needed to defeat Enel and ring the Golden Bell for the sake of Cricket, in order to show him that the city of gold that Noland wrote about was indeed real.{{Qref|chap=294|ep=190}}

Luffy tried grabbing onto the Ark Maxim, but Enel easily kicked his hand off, and Enel responded to Luffy's ensuing attempts by striking him with lightning bolts. Luffy then got the idea to write a message on a giant leaf to tell the people at Giant Jack's base to cut down the beanstalk so it would fall westward toward the Maxim. Luffy was surprised to see that Nami was sticking with him, and Nami told him that he needed her to pilot the waver the rest of the way up and so she was willing to take that risk.{{Qref|chap=295|ep=191}} Zoro, Nola, and Wyper were able to successfully tip Giant Jack toward the west, and Nami drove the waver up the beanstalk as fast as it would go while Luffy held onto her from behind.{{Qref|chap=296|ep=191}} As the duo shot off the beanstalk and flew toward the Maxim, Enel brought down an even larger '''Raigo''' to destroy all of Skypiea. To Nami's shock, Luffy jumped off the waver directly into the '''Raigo''', and while inside it, Luffy threw his golden ball around in every possible direction. The ball conducted the electricity inside the giant thunder sphere, and so Luffy was able to completely disperse the '''Raigo''' and save Skypiea.{{Qref|chap=297|ep=192}}

[[File:Luffy Rings the Shandorian Golden Belfry Bell With Gomu Gomu no Ogon Rifle.png|thumb|Luffy defeating Enel and ringing the Golden Bell.]]

With the Maxim and the Golden Bell now in his sights, Luffy stretched back his right arm and twisted it around. Enel responded by fully transforming into lightning in a shape resembling a larger version of his body, though Luffy was still able to bypass his transformation and land blows on him. However, Enel was able to reach around Luffy with an arm of lightning and stab him in the back with his trident. Luffy's only options were to either let the trident pierce him further or fall back all the way down to Skypiea, and he decided to let go and fall; however, he then grabbed onto a small piece of island cloud near the Maxim and pulled himself back up. Luffy reared back and twisted his right arm again and sent the golden ball crashing into Enel's giant body, smashing him against the Golden Bell. Luffy cried out for the Golden Bell to ring, and as it did so, Enel's transformation deactivated and the God was defeated.{{Qref|chap=298|ep=192}} Luffy fell down along with Enel, the Maxim, and the bell, but landed on a small piece of island cloud where Nami was.{{Qref|chap=299|ep=193}}

Luffy and Nami jumped back down to Upper Yard, with Luffy using '''Gomu Gomu no Fusen''' to cushion their fall. They then came across the priests' storehouse and took the large amounts of food from inside it before arriving at Shandora and reuniting with the rest of their crew. Night fell as the crew ate the priests' food, and then they took part in a large party with the Skypieans and Shandia.{{Qref|chap=300|ep=193}} The party lasted for several days, and one night when everyone was sleeping, Luffy woke the crew up and told them they should steal the city's treasure and run away. The next morning, Luffy took some of the crew inside the sleeping Nola's stomach, where they took the treasures from the ruins that the snake had eaten. The crew then anxiously waited for Robin to arrive so they could depart without being caught, and when Robin came with several Skypieans behind her, the crew quickly ran away with their stolen treasure, not realizing the citizens had come to give them an even greater amount.{{Qref|chap=301|ep=194}} The Straw Hats sailed to Cloud End, where they bid farewell to Conis and Pagaya. They were then sent off a ledge and fell straight down, but Conis called a Balloon Octopus which grabbed the Merry and inflated itself, giving the crew a controlled descent to the Blue Sea.{{Qref|chap=302|ep=195}}

==Water 7 Saga==
===Long Ring Long Land Arc===
====The Three Events====
Upon returning from Skypiea to the [[Blue Sea]], Luffy and his crew had no time to rest as they encountered a giant wave created by some Sea Monkeys. After the brief incident, Luffy and his crew rested and assessed the good wealth they obtained from their Sky Island adventure. As Luffy discussed with his crew, they all agreed that they would use the treasure to help fix the travel-worn Going Merry and get a shipwright to help maintain it. After encountering the Sea Monkeys once again and a curious pirate ship with no sails or crew, Luffy and his crew reached the next island in their journey. As Luffy, along with Usopp and Chopper, decided to explore the island, they noticed that the animals and plant life were all very long in appearance.{{Qref|chap=303|chap2=304|page=|ep=207|Luffy and his crew return to the Blue Sea and reach [[Long Ring Long Land]].}}

As Luffy and his two companions explored the island more, they encountered a nomad named [[Tonjit]] who had been stuck on his stilts for 10 long years. After getting acquainted with the old man and reuniting him with his horse, [[Shelly]], Luffy and his companions felt that they had done small accomplishment. However, in the midst of their enjoyment, Shelly was suddenly shot. Learning immediately that the shot was fired by the pirate, [[Foxy]], who was nearby, Luffy momentarily get angry at this foe. Before Luffy could fight Foxy however, he was suddenly challenged to an official [[Davy Back Fight]].{{Qref|chap=305|chap2=306|page=|ep=208|Luffy meets Foxy and accepts his challenge to a Davy Back Fight.}}

From Usopp, Luffy learned that this sudden challenge was a set of three games between pirate crews in which the crew members were at stake. Despite Usopp's warnings however and much to the dismay of the rest of his crew, Luffy accepted the challenge from Foxy and his crew to hold a Davy Back Fight on [[Long Ring Long Land]]. What happened next was a festival-like event set up by the [[Foxy Pirates]] in lieu of the Davy Back games. After the formalities of the beginning of the games, Luffy and his crew decided who would participate in which game. Taking the final and most climatic game, Combat, Luffy awaited for his turn as he watched the rest of his crew participate in the other games.

The first two games of the Davy Back Fight proved to be both surprising and emotional for Luffy and his crew. In the first game, Donut Race, they witnessed Foxy and his crew's cheating tricks, and Foxy's exploit of his Devil Fruit powers of the [[Noro Noro no Mi]]. Due to these, Luffy lost Chopper to Foxy. Fortunately, Luffy was able to win Chopper back as his crew won the second game, Groggy Ring, despite the gigantic odds stacked against them. After watching these two grueling games, Luffy was pumped up for his turn in the final game.

[[File:Foxy Defeated by Luffy.png|thumb|left|Luffy defeats Foxy.]]

With the third game approaching, Luffy with the help from Usopp, decided to dress appropriately for the match. Donning an afro and boxing outfit, Luffy was ready to face against the sly Foxy aboard his ship, the [[Sexy Foxy]]. Throughout the whole match, Luffy was constantly tricked by his smarter opponent as they battled all around the ship. With Foxy's tricks and Devil Fruit powers, it seemed like Luffy would lose. Despite this, Luffy persevered to not lose one of his crew forever. In the climax of the battle, Luffy was able to thwart Foxy by using a mirror shard obtained from the battle to reflect Foxy's powers back to himself. Having slowed Foxy down, Luffy delivered the final blow and won the game.{{Qref|chap=313|chap2=318|page=|ep=217|ep2=219|Luffy fights against Foxy in the final game of the Davy Back games.}}

After a lot of rest, Luffy wakes up being told he indeed did win the fight. Foxy comes to congratulate Luffy on how he fought in the match, giving a handshake gesture, then attempting to throw him overhead, forgetting his arm is rubber. As Luffy won, he gets to choose a crew member from the Foxy Pirates, but instead choose their flag, but as the sail is their flag, Luffy opts to "redesign" the flag, then give it back. Luffy's poorly drawn Jolly Roger is given to them, officially ending the Davy Back Fight. Although obviously grateful, Foxy vows revenge on Luffy for losing the match. The Straw Hats return to Tonjit giving him the Foxy Pirates' old flag as a sign of their defeat. Chopper uses it as a bandage for Shelly, the horse.

====Encounter with Admiral Aokiji====

[[File:Ice Time.png|thumb|210px|Luffy being frozen by [[Admiral]] [[Kuzan|Aokiji]].]]

Just as Luffy and his crew were done with the dealing with the matter with Foxy and his pirates, they soon came across another one. Sleeping beside Tonjit's house was the [[Admiral]] [[Kuzan|Aokiji]]. Initially, Aokiji was non-hostile to Luffy and his crew, despite him being a Marine and causing Luffy some fear when he told him that he knew his grandfather. Aokiji even helped Tonjit in finding a way to get back to the rest of the old man's nomad clan with his [[Hie Hie no Mi]]. However, when hostilities began between Aokiji and Nico Robin, Luffy and his crew faced off against this new foe. Despite their best efforts, Luffy and those who fought alongside him against Aokiji were utterly defeated. Fortunately however, the admiral simply left a frozen Luffy in defeat, but with a warning to be wary with Nico Robin.

===Water 7 Arc===
====The Captain's Burden====
Seven days after the encounter with Aokiji, Luffy had recovered and demonstrated his new frozen pose as his crew sailed to their next destination. They then encountered the giant frog [[Yokozuna]] and chased after him, with Luffy wanting to eat him. However, they were forced to turn back after getting caught in the path of the [[Sea Train]], and Luffy watched as Yokozuna unsuccessfully tried to attack it. The crew went to the shift station nearby and met [[Kokoro]] and her granddaughter [[Chimney]], and Kokoro told them that their next destination, [[Water 7]], was home to the world's best carpenters. Luffy grew excited, hoping to find a carpenter crewmate there.{{Qref|chap=322|ep=229}} Kokoro gave them a map and a letter of recommendation, telling them to find a man named [[Iceburg]]. As they continued sailing toward Water 7, Luffy talked with his crewmates about what they wanted their carpenter to be like.{{Qref|name=c323|chap=323|ep=229}}

Upon reaching the island, the crew was forced to dock at a small peninsula in the back, and they marveled at its architecture. Nami forced Luffy and Usopp to go with her to meet Iceburg.{{Qref|name=c323}} They headed to the city center to exchange their gold for money, and Luffy bought [[Yagara Bulls]] to take them there.{{Qref|chap=324|ep=229|ep2=230}} The trio got {{B}}300,000,000 from their gold, and headed for the shipyard. There, they met the carpenter [[Kaku]] of the [[Galley-La Company]], who revealed that Iceburg was the mayor of Water 7. To make their meeting with him go faster, Kaku went to check out the Merry himself.{{Qref|chap=325|ep=231}} The trio then met Iceburg, who to their surprise acted very irresponsibly, although his secretary [[Kalifa]] attacked them when they pointed it out. Iceburg then offered to give them a tour of the shipyard.{{Qref|chap=326|ep=231}}

The [[Franky Family]] suddenly swooped in and stole the Straw Hats' money, but [[Paulie]] took them out, and [[Rob Lucci]] forced Paulie to give the crew their money back. Luffy was awestruck when Iceburg took them inside the shipyard's [[Dock 1]], and unsuccessfully tried to get him to join his crew. Kaku then returned to the shipyard, and he broke the news that the Going Merry was damaged beyond repair and could not sail any farther.{{Qref|chap=327|ep=232}} Luffy refused to believe that they would need to find a replacement ship, but the workers gave him no option but to reconsider. Luffy and Nami then realized that the contents of their suitcases were empty, and overheard [[Peepley Lulu]] reveal that he had seen Usopp (whom he mistook for Kaku) with the Franky Family, causing Luffy to immediately run off to find his crewmate.{{Qref|chap=328|ep=233}}

[[File:March to Franky House.png|thumb|left|210px|Luffy, Zoro, Sanji, and Chopper attack the Franky House to avenge Usopp.]]

While looking for Usopp, Luffy accidentally fell in a canal, where he was found and rescued by Zoro, Sanji, and Chopper. They soon found a heavily beaten Usopp in the clearing between the city and the [[Franky House]], and they headed toward the Franky House to teach the Franky Family a lesson.{{Qref|chap=329|ep=234}} Upon entering the house, the four of them immediately started attacking and overwhelming the Franky Family, not stopping even when they revealed their boss [[Franky]] had gone to spend the stolen money. By the end of the battle, the entire Franky House was destroyed, and as the Straw Hats were thinking about what to do next, Luffy announced that he had decided for the crew to bid farewell to the Going Merry.{{Qref|chap=330|ep=234}}

[[File:Usopp vs. Luffy.png|thumb|210px|Luffy duels with Usopp over the Going Merry's fate.]]

The group took Usopp back to the Merry, and after he regained consciousness, Luffy told him about his decision to look for a new ship. Usopp refused to believe what the carpenters had said, but Luffy stood firm in his decision as their argument grew more heated. Usopp then decided to leave the crew, and challenged Luffy to a duel for the Merry.{{Qref|chap=331|ep=235}} The time of the duel was set for 10 PM, and Luffy laid around until then. Luffy and Usopp then confronted each other on the peninsula at the appointed time, and as Luffy went on the offensive, Usopp managed to stop him by pretending to be injured. This allowed Usopp to barrage Luffy with a variety of long-range attacks, culminating in a massive gas explosion that dealt some injuries to Luffy.{{Qref|chap=332|ep=236}} Luffy was able to punch Usopp in the face, but Usopp countered his next attack with an [[Impact Dial]], which he redirected at Luffy. However, the recoil of the Dial left Usopp unable to defend against Luffy's next attack, which defeated him. Luffy then bid farewell to Usopp, saying the former Straw Hat could do whatever he wished with the Merry as he tearfully headed back toward his crew.{{Qref|chap=333|ep=236}}

====Encountering CP9====
The Straw Hats, minus a missing Robin, left the Going Merry for good and stayed the night at an inn. The next morning, Luffy heard from Nami that Iceburg had been shot, and the two of them took a Yagara Bull to go see him.{{Qref|chap=334|ep=237}} They were met by a crowd as they reached Dock 1, and Franky then arrived to confront Luffy for attacking his family.{{Qref|chap=335|ep=237|ep2=238}} Franky breathed fire at Luffy and Nami before jumping into the water and attacking their boat. He then punched Luffy by detaching his arm, revealing that he was a [[cyborg]]. Luffy and Franky continued fighting furiously in the dock when they were interrupted by Paulie, Kaku, Lucci, Peepley Lulu, and [[Tilestone]].{{Qref|chap=336|ep=238}}

Paulie, Lulu, and Lucci attacked and overpowered Luffy, with Paulie revealing that the Straw Hats were the main suspects in the attack on Iceburg, as Robin was one of the two attackers he had seen. Luffy refused to believe that Robin had done this and demanded to speak with Iceburg, but the Galley-La workers stood against him as the townspeople subdued Nami.{{Qref|chap=337|ep=238|ep2=239}} Luffy attempted to escape from the workers as they pulled out sharp and explosive weapons to attack him, but he was quickly cornered and shot by Tilestone's bazooka. However, Franky then unleashed a massive attack on Dock 1, allowing Luffy to escape with Nami.{{Qref|chap=338|ep=239}}

Luffy and Nami managed to reach [[Galley-La Headquarters]] where Iceburg resided, and Luffy pulled himself in through the window. As he ran through the building, Kalifa called out to him and let him enter Iceburg's room. There, Iceburg demanded that Luffy bring Robin in to speak with him. Luffy replied that he was unable to, and he was forced to escape outside as Iceburg shot at him.{{Qref|chap=339|ep=239}} Luffy and Nami escaped to the outskirts of town and reunited with Zoro, but they were soon forced to hide from the citizens hunting for them. Chopper then found them and revealed that Robin had told him and Sanji that she had framed them for the attack on Iceburg and would be leaving them forever, shocking them.{{Qref|chap=340|ep=240|ep2=241}} Zoro deduced that Robin and her new mysterious cohorts would likely try to kill Iceburg that night, and Luffy decided to go back to Galley-La Headquarters to confront her and find out the truth.{{Qref|chap=341|ep=241}}

As night fell, Luffy, Zoro, Nami, and Chopper hid in a tree near Headquarters, looking for Robin to make her move. They eventually saw a massive explosion be unleashed in front of the building,{{Qref|chap=342|ep=242}} and Luffy immediately headed toward the building. He was blown into a crevice in another building,{{Qref|chap=343|ep=243}} but escaped it and pulled himself toward Headquarters.{{Qref|chap=344|ep=243}} Luffy partially broke into a room where Paulie was with two masked men, and he recognized the masked men as enemies, telling them to give Robin back. The masked men then attacked and subdued him, binding him and Paulie to the ground before leaving.{{Qref|chap=345|ep=243}} Luffy eventually managed to squeeze out of his bindings and freed Paulie of his before the two of them raced toward Iceburg's room. After initially breaking into the wrong room, Luffy and Paulie reached Iceburg's room at the same time as Zoro, Nami, and Chopper. There, they found Robin with Lucci, Kaku, Kalifa, and the bartender [[Blueno]], who were undercover assassins from the [[World Government]] agency [[CP9]].{{Qref|chap=346|ep=244}}

Luffy intervened when Lucci started attacking Paulie, but Lucci used his [[Rokushiki]] techniques to overwhelm him. Robin then told her former crewmates that she was pursuing a goal that she could not reach with them. Lucci told the Straw Hats, Iceburg, and Paulie that the mansion would soon go up in flames, but he and his comrades remained in the room to prevent them from escaping.{{Qref|chap=347|ep=245}} Luffy tried to get to Robin, only for the agents to overwhelm him with their [[Rokushiki]] techniques. As Robin headed to the window, Luffy tried running toward her again, only to be stopped and tossed aside by Lucci as she departed.{{Qref|chap=348|ep=245}} With the fire starting, Lucci decided to show Luffy's group the power of his Devil Fruit, the [[Neko Neko no Mi, Model: Leopard]]. Lucci unleashed a powered-up [[Rokushiki/Rankyaku|Rankyaku]] attack that caused the building to start collapsing, and Luffy attacked the agent when he confronted Paulie and Iceburg. However, Lucci pierced through Luffy's body with a claw-enhanced [[Rokushiki/Shigan|Shigan]] before throwing him out of the building, sending him flying far away.{{Qref|chap=349|ep=246}}

Luffy flew into a narrow gap between two buildings, where he became stuck.{{Qref|chap=360|ep=252}} A while later, he heard Nami calling out to him from a nearby building, and Nami revealed to him that Robin had fallen in the World Government's grip in order to save their lives. Intent on saving Robin, Luffy pushed the two buildings apart and pulled himself and Nami away from the outskirts of town right before an enormous wave created by [[Aqua Laguna]] swallowed the area.{{Qref|chap=363|ep=254}} However, the waves eventually reached and swallowed Luffy, Nami, Zoro, and Chopper as well, forcing Paulie to rescue them. After finding out that Sanji had stowed away on the Sea Train taking Robin to [[Enies Lobby]], Luffy asked Paulie for a ship to use to go after them. Due to the Aqua Laguna, Paulie refused to do that until the next morning, causing Luffy to decide to take a ship by force. However, Kokoro then interjected and told Luffy that she could take him to another, secret, Sea Train.{{Qref|chap=364|ep=254|ep2=255}}

[[File:Straw Hat, Galley-La, and Franky Family Alliance Formed.png|thumb|left|210px|Luffy forms an alliance with the Galley-La Company and Franky Family on the way to Enies Lobby.]]

Kokoro took the Straw Hats into an abandoned warehouse, where she showed them the runaway prototype train [[Rocketman]]. Iceburg was already there and revealed that he had already got the train's systems running, and as the crew prepared to depart, the Franky Family came in and pleaded to come aboard so they could save Franky. Luffy agreed to this, and the train set off.{{Qref|chap=365|ep=255}} The Straw Hats soon discovered that Paulie and the Galley-La workers had stowed away on Rocketman, and Luffy formed an official pact with Galley-La and the Franky Family to defeat their enemies and rescue Robin and Franky together.{{Qref|chap=366|ep=256}} Rocketman headed toward a massive, deadly tidal wave, and after the Galley-La workers and Franky Family could not put a dent in it, Luffy and Zoro unleashed a combined attack to create a whole the Rocketman could roll through.{{Qref|chap=367|ep=257}}

Having gotten past Aqua Laguna, Luffy, Zoro, and Nami equipped themselves for the battle ahead.{{Qref|chap=368|ep=258}} They came to some of the [[Puffing Tom]]'s detached cars, and Luffy jumped into them to see if Sanji was there. He was immediately confronted and shot by several World Government agents, and as Rocketman approached, Luffy told Zoro to bisect the cars. Soon afterwards, the Rocketman crew approached the Marine Captain [[T Bone]], who was running toward the rest of the Puffing Tom. Luffy told his allies to leave this to Zoro as well, and Zoro quickly dispatched T Bone.{{Qref|chap=371|ep=260|ep2=261}} Later, Luffy's group found Yokozuna standing in front of the oncoming train, and Luffy told the giant frog to get out of the way.{{Qref|chap=374|ep=262}} Yokozuna hit Rocketman off the rails, but after Luffy pulled him onboard, Kokoro managed to get the giant frog to join the fight as she got the train back on the tracks. Soon afterwards, the Rocketman crew had Enies Lobby in their sights.{{Qref|chap=375|ep=263|ep2=264}}

===Enies Lobby Arc===
====On the Warpath to Robin====
The Franky Family approached the Rocketman again after being derailed by Yokozuna, this time with Sanji and Usopp in tow. However, Usopp was wearing a mask and Luffy did not recognize him, causing him to believe Usopp's claim that he was a different person known as "Sogeking". Iceburg outlined a plan for the Straw Hats to remain on Rocketman while the Galley-La workers and Franky Family went on ahead to clear the way to the main island for the pirates to quickly charge in and take on CP9. Luffy acknowledged this plan, but then proceeded to head out and jump toward Enies Lobby by himself, using '''Gomu Gomu no Rocket''' to launch himself over the Main Gate from the protective fence. Upon landing, he immediately charged toward the Tower of Justice and beat up any Marines in his way.{{Qref|chap=376|ep=264}} Luffy quickly fought his way through to the Main Island Gate and pulled himself up past it, and upon landing on the main island he was surrounded by tens of thousands of Marine soldiers.{{Qref|chap=377|ep=265}} Despite being vastly outnumbered, Luffy was able to terrorize the Marine forces, taking out hundreds of them in the span of seconds.{{Qref|chap=378|ep=266}} Luffy eventually managed to elude the Marines and pulled himself up to the roof of the Courthouse, where Blueno arrived through an "Air Door" to confront him.{{Qref|chap=382|ep=269}}

[[File:Luffy Vs Blueno.png|thumb|210px|Luffy overpowering Blueno.]]

Blueno told Luffy that he and his allies were committing a grave offense with their invasion, but Luffy did not care and charged toward him. Despite Blueno using '''[[Rokushiki/Tekkai|Tekkai]]''', Luffy's strike was still powerful enough to injure him, and Luffy was then able to keep up with the agent despite him using '''[[Rokushiki/Soru|Soru]]''' and smash him to the floor.{{Qref|chap=383|ep=270}} Luffy managed to dodge Blueno's rapid attacks, but the agent then used his [[Doa Doa no Mi]] powers to create doors in the floor under Luffy's feet, trapping him. Blueno then turned Luffy's face into a revolving door which heavily distracted him,{{Qref|chap=385|ep=271}} but Luffy was still able to dodge his '''[[Rokushiki/Rankyaku|Rankyaku]]''' strike by going down through the floor. Luffy and Blueno then sparred some more, and despite the pirate being able to keep up with the agent's superhuman movements, he was unable to gain the upper hand. To enable himself to become stronger, Luffy activated a new ability called '''[[Gomu Gomu no Mi/Gear 2 Techniques|Gear 2]]''' where he inflated his blood vessels, causing his blood to flow at a faster rate.{{Qref|chap=387|ep=272}} Luffy then punched Blueno with such speed that even the agent with his Soru ability could not keep up, and proceeded to heavily injure him with powerful blows. Blueno was forced to retreat into an '''Air Door''' and tried opening one behind Luffy to ambush him, but Luffy easily dodged him before striking him with '''Gomu Gomu no Jet Bazooka'''. The attack broke through Blueno's '''Tekkai''' and greatly injured him, and when the agent stayed on his feet afterward, Luffy prepared to activate a new Gear to become even more powerful. However, Blueno then lost consciousness and fell to the ground, and Luffy noted that his body was extremely tired due to not being used to the strain of Gear 2 yet. He then shouted out to the Tower of Justice where Robin was, saying he had come for her.{{Qref|chap=388|ep=273}}

Luffy was able to regain his energy by pulling two slabs of meat out of his pockets that he had packed as a box lunch, and called for anyone to come out of the Tower of Justice. Franky then blasted himself and Robin out of the tower, but they were stopped by a fence and had to pull themselves onto the tower's ledge. Luffy prepared to pull himself to the tower, but Robin stopped him, saying that she wanted to die and never wanted to see him again. As she said this, [[Spandam]] and the CP9 agents came out to the ledge and confronted Luffy.{{Qref|chap=389|ep=274}} At this point, the rest of the Straw Hats made it up to the Courthouse roof, and as they joined Luffy in facing Robin and CP9, Luffy told Robin that she could choose to die if she wanted, but he wanted her to do so while she was with them.{{Qref|chap=390|ep=274}} Robin responded that the entire world was against her and that she did not want the Straw Hats to consider her a burden given what they would face if she was with them; Spandam backed up that assertion, using it as an opportunity to boast of the World Government's great might while pointing to the official flag sailing above him. However, Luffy responded by telling Sogeking to shoot down the flag, and the sniper did so, burning it up. Spandam was left aghast that Luffy directly declared war against the World Government, and Luffy replied that he was fine with that. He then told Robin to say she wanted to live, and Robin tearfully did so. As the drawbridge between the Courthouse and Tower of Justice was lowered thanks to the Franky Family, the Straw Hats prepared to invade the tower.{{Qref|chap=398|ep=278}}

However, the drawbridge was stopped by a mortar strike, and Spandam quickly tried to lead Robin away. Soon afterwards, though, Nami received a call from Kokoro that she was piloting the Rocketman to the Tower of Justice. Upon hearing this, Luffy grabbed all of his crewmates and jumped into the chasm between the Courthouse and Tower, and they landed on Rocketman as it leaped from the drawbridge and flew toward the tower.{{Qref|chap=399|ep=284}} The train crashed into the tower before coming to a halt, and as the Straw Hats recovered from the wreck, they were confronted by the CP9 agent [[Fukurou]]. Fukurou revealed that Spandam and Lucci were taking Robin to the [[Gates of Justice]], and Robin was chained by handcuffs made of [[Seastone]] that were unbreakable and prevented her from using her powers. Fukurou and the four other CP9 agents in the tower each possessed a key, only one of which would unlock the handcuffs. Luffy tried attacking Fukurou to get his key and the agent departed, and Luffy tried going after him, but was held back by Zoro. The Straw Hats and Franky told Luffy to go directly after Lucci and Robin while they took on the other CP9 agents.{{Qref|chap=400|ep=285}}

Luffy ran up the stairs and managed to reach the room that the agents and Robin had just been in, though it was now deserted; he then started running towards the Gates of Justice.{{Qref|chap=401|ep=286}} He made it to the other end of the tower, but found nothing but water in between it and the Gates, and so tried to think of a way to get across.{{Qref|chap=402|ep=287}} He tried rowing a small boat there, but the rough ocean currents destroyed the boat and left him floundering in the water. Fortunately, Chimney and Gonbe arrived and retrieved Luffy from the water, having come to tell him that there was an underground passage from the tower to the Gates. The trio raced down a flight of stairs and came to a giant steel door; despite the door being locked, Luffy was able to break through it by activating a new Gear called '''[[Gomu Gomu no Mi/Gear 3 Techniques|Gear 3]]''', and Chimney and Gonbe were shocked upon seeing Luffy shrink to the size of a child after using it.{{Qref|chap=403|ep=288}} However, Luffy quickly returned to normal size as he ran down the hall toward Robin.{{Qref|chap=404|ep=288}} Luffy eventually ran to a door which he was able to kick through, and found himself in a large storeroom in a tower propping up the Bridge of Hesitation. There, he was confronted by Lucci.{{Qref|chap=408|ep=293}}

====Luffy vs. Rob Lucci====

[[File:Luffy and Lucci Clash.png|thumb|left|225px|Luffy and Lucci clash.]]

Luffy tried to get through to keep chasing after Robin, but Lucci stayed in his way and the two clashed, with their powerful strikes resulting in heavy collateral damage.{{Qref|chap=409|ep=294}} Luffy managed to catch Lucci off-guard with his speed and throw the agent aside, but Lucci quickly recovered and kicked the pirate before he could run out of the room.{{Qref|chap=410|ep=295}} Their sparring was interrupted when Franky suddenly arrived, possessing two of the CP9 agents' keys; he offered to help Luffy fight Lucci, but Luffy told him to keep going and save Robin.{{Qref|chap=416|ep=299}} Lucci managed to overpower Luffy so he could attack Franky; however, Luffy then activated Gear 2 and hit the agent with powerful, lightning-fast punches. Lucci transformed into his human-leopard hybrid form and tried to attack Franky again, but Luffy successfully overwhelmed him with Gear 2 enough to allow Franky to exit the room.{{Qref|chap=418|ep=300}} Luffy and Lucci continued sparring, but the agent then used a '''Rankyaku''' strike to rip a hole in the wall that would flood the underground passage with seawater, saying that Luffy's crewmates would either drown or be bombarded by the incoming [[Buster Call]] and he would be incapable of saving them.{{Qref|chap=420|ep=302}}

[[File:Gomu Gomu no Gigant Pistol.png|thumb|Luffy strikes Lucci with Gomu Gomu no Gigant Pistol.]]

The room where they were in started filling up with seawater, and Luffy followed Lucci up to the room above which was above sea level and would not be flooded. Lucci said that Luffy could go and help his friends if he wanted, but Luffy responded that if he left Lucci alone, the agent would kill all of them. Lucci was able to overpower and injure Luffy with some advanced '''[[Rokushiki/Shigan|Shigan]]''', '''Rankyaku''', and '''Tekkai''' techniques, so Luffy decided to show him Gear 3. Luffy blew into his thumb and inflated the bones in his right arm, making it equivalent in size to a giant's. He then threw a punch at Lucci with this giant right arm, demolishing the wall and tower in front of him and launching the agent out of the structure.{{Qref|chap=421|ep=304}} Afterwards, Luffy transferred the air to his torso and pulled himself onto the Marine battleship that Lucci had fallen onto, where he proceeded to transfer the air to his leg and unleash a powerful stomp that wreaked tremendous destruction. Lucci leaped onto the mast and transformed into his full-leopard form, allowing him to maul Luffy's left shoulder. Luffy brought the air to his torso to repel Lucci, but proceeded to be overwhelmed by the agent due to Gear 3 reducing his speed.{{Qref|chap=422|ep=305}} However, Marine [[Vice Admiral]] [[Onigumo]] then had his ship fire at the ship Luffy and Lucci were on in order to kill the former, but Luffy was saved from its destruction when he was forced to release the air inflating his body, blowing him back to the prop towers where he was before. But since he was the size of a child again due to Gear 3's side effects, Luffy tried to run and hide from Lucci until he returned to normal.{{Qref|name=c423|chap=423|ep=306}}

[[File:Sai Dai Rin Rokuogan.png|thumb|left|Luffy struck by Sai Dai Rin: Rokuogan.]]

This tactic did not work, as Lucci found Luffy and assaulted him with '''Shigan''' before smashing his small body up against a wall, trapping him. Fortunately, however, Lucci became affected by damage that Luffy had given him earlier and was stopped from unleashing a deadly attack, and enough time passed to allow Luffy to return to normal size.{{Qref|name=c423}} Luffy then activated Gear 2 once again despite the potentially debilitating effect it could have on his body.{{Qref|chap=424|ep=307}} Luffy was able to overwhelm Lucci with his attacks, but Lucci then attacked him with a new technique called '''[[Rokushiki/Rokuogan|Rokuogan]]''', a Rokushiki ability accessible to those who had mastered the normal six techniques. The technique created a shockwave that damaged Luffy internally much like an Impact Dial, though with significantly greater power.{{Qref|chap=425|ep=308}} As the walls around them started to crumble from the bombardment, Luffy looked outside and saw his crewmates on a nearby part of the bridge encouraging him. Luffy resumed fighting Lucci, but the agent noted that his Gear 2 power appeared to have lost its edge before attacking the pirate with another '''Rokuogan''' strike, causing him to collapse to the floor.{{Qref|chap=426|ep=308}}

[[File:Luffy Using Jet Gatling on Lucci.png|thumb|210px|Luffy using Gomu Gomu no Jet Gatling to defeat Rob Lucci.]]

However, Usopp then called out to Luffy, having removed his Sogeking mask, and also called out Lucci, saying he would be the agent's next opponent. Luffy protested, and Usopp said he would need to get back up and win if he wanted to keep Lucci away from him, saying they would all go back together once the agent was defeated. Spurred on by Usopp's words, Luffy got back up and exchanged a flurry of blows with Lucci. Lucci then wrapped his tail around Luffy's body and struck him with another '''Rokuogan''', but despite taking that attack, Luffy quickly got up. He then assaulted Lucci with a flurry of Gear 2 punches in a technique called '''Gomu Gomu no Jet Gatling''', which sent the agent crashing into the wall and knocked him unconscious. Victorious at last, Luffy shouted out to Robin that they would be going back together.{{Qref|chap=427|ep=309}} However, Luffy then collapsed from his wounds, and though he heard Usopp's call to join them on an escape ship and became surrounded by all five of the Buster Call battleships, he stated that his body could not move at all. However, Usopp had Robin push Luffy off the edge of the prop tower with her ability, and as Luffy fell toward the ocean the Going Merry suddenly surfaced, giving the Straw Hats a chance to escape.{{Qref|chap=428|ep=310}}

[[File:Going Merry's Funeral.png|thumb|left|210px|Luffy and his crew bid farewell the Going Merry in its last moments.]]

Luffy fell into the ocean but was quickly rescued by Kokoro, who tossed him onto the Merry. As the Straw Hats collected themselves, Robin thanked everyone for saving her, and Luffy grinned in response. The Marine battleships prepared to fire at the Merry, but their aim was thrown off due to Sanji having closed the Gates of Justice which created violent whirlpools. One of the ships managed to lock onto the Merry and fire, but Zoro and Sanji used Luffy's body to intercept the cannonballs and launch them back at the Marines. Franky used '''Coup de Vent''' to blast the Merry away from the battleships, allowing the Straw Hats to sail away from Enies Lobby victorious.{{Qref|chap=429|ep=311}} Once they reached safety, Usopp put his Sogeking mask back on and lied that Usopp had gone off on another boat, which Luffy believed. The Straw Hats then encountered a Galley-La ship captained by Iceburg, and as this happened, the entire bow of the Merry nearly broke off entirely. Luffy begged Iceburg to help Merry, saying the ship was essentially their crewmate. However, Iceburg replied that the best thing to do for the Merry would be to let it rest. After a few seconds, Luffy solemnly accepted this, and after his crew had evacuated the ship, Luffy used a torch to set it on fire before disembarking onto a small rowboat. Luffy thanked the Merry for all it had done for them, and as the ship burned, it stunningly spoke to the crew like it had during its arrival on Enies Lobby, apologizing for being unable to carry them further. Merry's words caused Luffy to start bawling as he apologized to the ship for treating it as poorly as he had; however, Merry then responded that it was happy to have gone this far, and thanked the Straw Hats for taking care of it as it broke down and sank into the sea.{{Qref|chap=430|ep=312}}

===Post-Enies Lobby Arc===
As everyone relaxed at Water 7 two days later, Franky decided to build a [[ship]] for the crew out of the special wood called [[Treasure Tree Adam|Adam Wood]]. However, at that point, Marines led by [[Monkey D. Garp|Vice Admiral Garp]] broke into Iceburg's mansion where everyone was staying, and punched the still-asleep Luffy to wake him up. To everyone's shock, Luffy revealed that Garp is really his grandfather,{{Qref|chap=431|page=|ep=313|Back at [[Water 7]].}} and revealed the training Garp put him through as a child. Garp soon told Luffy about the [[Four Emperors]] and how [[Shanks]] was one of them. Soon after, Garp asked Luffy about his meeting with his father as Luffy was surprised to learn he had a father and he encountered him in [[Loguetown]]. Garp casually revealed the name of Luffy's father, known as [[Monkey D. Dragon|Dragon]] the Revolutionary, who is considered by the World Government to be the worst criminal in the world. Luffy did not know of Dragon as he is met with surprise from his crew and friends before he turned to Robin, who informed him why his father was infamous. Afterwards, Garp said that it was supposed to be a secret.{{Qref|chap=432|page=|ep=314|Back at [[Water 7]].}}

[[File:Zoro Discusses Usopp's Membership with Luffy.png|thumb|Zoro discusses Usopp's return to the crew with Luffy.]]

Sometime after, Sanji revealed to the Straw Hats that Usopp was planning to rejoin the crew. While Luffy, Nami, and Chopper wanted him to rejoin and planned to invite him back, Zoro insisted that Luffy should be a firm captain on his position, and Usopp shouldn't return so easily as he should return on their terms, not his. Zoro even threatened to leave the crew if Usopp was allowed to rejoin without asking for forgiveness for his behavior. Luffy understood the message and agreed with Zoro's view of the situation.

A few days later, Chimney, Gonbe, [[Mozu and Kiwi]] burst in on the Straw Hats to tell them their new ship was complete. Shortly after, [[Zambai]] and the rest of the Franky Family also appeared, revealing to the Straw Hats their new [[Bounties]]. They then revealed that their boss also received a bounty, which led them to the Straw Hats who they begged to let him join their crew. After the Straw Hats, they excitedly left to [[Scrap Island]], where their new ship was moored. There, Iceburg unveiled their new caravel, much to the pirates' delight. After briefly exploring the ship, Luffy asked Iceburg where Franky was. Having discerned that the young captain wished to recruit Franky as their [[Shipwright]], Iceburg advised Luffy that if he really wanted Franky, he would need to use force.

With the help from the rest of the Franky Family, Luffy got a hold of Franky's underwear as a bargaining chip to get him to join his crew. Franky simply posed naked, unabashed, and said, "I'm still a man, naked." Meanwhile, Sanji came running with Zoro to tell everyone that Vice Admiral Garp had sailed on the opposite shore into attack position. Luffy then threw Franky's swim briefs back and told him to sail with them. Franky then stated that he did want to see his dream ship reach the end of the world and become the greatest ship ever built. Franky agreed to join after this.

Shortly after, Garp appeared and started attacking the Straw Hats and their new ship. At that moment, Usopp tried to rejoin the crew, but because of Zoro's speech, he was ignored until he apologized. During the struggle between Garp and the Straw Hats, Usopp finally apologized and admitted that he wanted to rejoin. With that note, Luffy tearfully accepted him back into the crew. With Usopp and Robin's return, Franky wished to grant the ship it's new name, and while most of the Straw Hats gave some suggestions, with Luffy giving some of the most ridiculous ones, they in the end went with Iceburg's suggestion, the [[Thousand Sunny]]. After escaping Garp's onslaught of iron balls using their new ships emergency escape feature, the ''Çoup de Burst''', the newly formed Straw Hat crew sailed off to find their next adventure.

===Thriller Bark Arc===
====Meeting Brook and Exploring Thriller Bark====

[[File:Luffy Asks Brook to Join.png|thumb|left|210px|Sanji and Nami panic as Luffy invites the skeleton [[Brook]] to join their crew.]]

After sailing for some time on the [[Thousand Sunny]], Luffy and the rest of the crew found themselves in the presence of a [[ghost ship]]. Wanting to explore the ship, Luffy along with Sanji and Nami climbed aboard. There they met a skeleton named [[Brook]]. When, Luffy asked him to join his crew, the skeleton eagerly accepted.{{Qref|chap=442|page=|ep=337|Brook is introduced.}} Luffy then brought Brook back to Thousand Sunny to show to the rest of the crew, much to their dismay. Over dinner, Brook explained his past and later explained that he really cannot join Luffy due to his current condition of having his shadow stolen.{{Qref|chap=443|page=|ep=338|Brook joins the Straw Hats for dinner and explains his past.}}

Luffy really wanting to have Brook as a member, promised to get Brook's shadow back no matter what. This pleased Brook so much that the skeleton decided to perform before the crew with his violin, revealing he is a musician. Just as Brook was about to perform, a ghost appeared as well as the gates of a strange island, [[Thriller Bark]]. These events prompted Brook to head to the island before Luffy and the rest of the Straw Hats' eyes.

With Luffy's resolve to go to the island to get his long awaited musician (in fact, nearly since the beginning of his journey) and to explore the island, Franky and Robin decided to join him also. After witnessing Franky's [[Mini Merry II|present]] to the Straw Hats, Luffy and the rest of the Straw Hats decided to look for Nami, Usopp, and Chopper who had not returned. However before Luffy and the rest could go to the island, they were stopped by an [[Absalom|invisible thing]].{{Qref|chap=444|page=|ep=399|Luffy, Zoro, Sanji, Robin, and Franky are kept from going ashore by Absalom.}}

After the Thousand Sunny got caught in what was apparently a spider web, Luffy and the rest descended to the island. There they met the [[Zombie#Cerberus|Cerberus]] which Luffy thought of eating,{{Qref|chap=446|page=|ep=340|Luffy, Zoro, Sanji, Robin, and Franky encounter the Cerberus.}} soon followed by even more strange creatures. At one point, they came across some ghosts, one of which Luffy tried to catch. The ghost was unaffected and instead passed through Luffy and temporarily drained his will to go on. After recovering, the group meets with some [[Thriller Bark Creatures#Zombies|Zombies]]. Luffy and the rest defeated the zombies with a combo technique.{{Qref|chap=448|page=|ep=342|Luffy and the Straw Hats with him defeat some Zombies with a combo.}} Luffy then asked the zombies about his three friends that came by earlier. The zombies inadvertently revealed that they attacked them when they showed up. For this, Luffy and the rest shoved the zombies back into their graves head first.

<div style="float:right">[[File:Spoil Requests Help.png|thumb|210px|Spoil begs Luffy to get his and the other victims' shadows back from Moria.]]</div>

The group then met with [[Spoil]], a zombie looking old man who asked them to defeat [[Gecko Moria]] who had stolen his shadow and the shadows of others like him. Robin then explained that Moria was a Shichibukai with a former bounty higher than Luffy. With plans to actually beat Moria, Luffy agreed to help the old man and the others who had their shadows stolen. As it began to rain, Luffy and the others discovered that [[Thriller Bark]] was actually a ship. With their goal in mind, they ventured into [[Thriller Bark Mansion|Moria's mansion]].{{Qref|chap=449|page=|ep=343|Luffy and the others with him agree to defeat Moria.}}

Inside the mansion, Luffy and the others fought against the Zombies in the dining hall. {{Qref|chap=450|page=|ep=344|Luffy and the others fight against the Zombies in the dining hall.}} After the battle, he and the others noticed that [[Sanji]] was missing. With nothing else to do in the room, Luffy and the others decided to take [[Buhichuck]], the leader of the Zombies in the room, along in order to have him guide them to the rest of their friends. As Luffy left the room, the Zombies told him to be scared of Moria's wrath for what Luffy and his friends did in the dining hall. Luffy in response, merely replied that he will "kick Moria's ass".

After walking awhile with Buhichuck as their hostage, Luffy, Robin, and Franky suddenly noticed that [[Roronoa Zoro|Zoro]] was missing too.{{Qref|chap=451|page=|ep=345|Luffy, Robin, and Franky notice that Zoro is now missing.}} The situation was beginning to become suspicious. Later, Luffy found a suit of armor and decided to don it. After a while, the three came upon an arena like area. There, Luffy and Robin witnessed a bout between Franky and a [[General Zombie]]. After witnessing it for while, Luffy's group were suddenly trapped in the room by Buhichuck. There they were forced to fight a large group of General Zombies.{{Qref|chap=452|page=|ep=346|Luffy, Robin, and Franky fight against the General Zombies.}} In the middle of the battle, Luffy found himself face to face with a General Zombie with three swords like Zoro. Before Luffy could get a clear answer from [[Jigoro]], he was caught off guard by some Spider Mice Zombies. Luffy was then sealed in a coffin by the Spider Mice with their webbing and was then sent to the main mast of Thriller Bark.

[[File:Moria Cuts Luffy's Shadow.png|thumb|left|192px|Luffy's shadow being cut by Moria.]]

Luffy was brought afterwards before [[Gecko Moria]].{{Qref|chap=455|page=|ep=349|Luffy is brought before Moria.}} After being stripped of his armor, Luffy had his shadow stolen by Moria through the use of the power of the Devil Fruit Moria ate, the [[Kage Kage no Mi]]. Upon being separated from his shadow, Luffy fell into a coma. With Luffy's shadow in Moria's hands, Moria decided to put it in the 900th Zombie, [[Oars]].{{Qref|chap=456|page=|ep=350|Moria decides to put Luffy's shadow in Oars.}} Having his shadow finished being extracted, Luffy was then brought back to the Thousand Sunny by some Spider Mice.{{-}}

====Counterattack Against Moria====
After being placed in the Thousand Sunny's kitchen along with Sanji and Zoro, Usopp managed to wake them up. After being briefed on what happened while they were out. With Nami and three of their shadows taken, Luffy and the others planned to take them back. Luffy was then informed by Franky of Brook's relationship with [[Laboon]]. Ever more excited by this information, Luffy is even more decided to have the skeleton join their crew. With this, Luffy and his crew decided to take back from Moria what he stole from them and their friends.{{Qref|chap=458|chap2=459|page=|ep=353|ep2=354|Luffy is awakened and decides with the rest of his crew to retaliate against Moria.}}

With the determination to get everything back before dawn arrives, Luffy and his crew split into two teams. With part of his team headed to save Nami and himself headed to defeat Moria, Luffy's team purified several zombies with some salt from Usopp. As they rampaged through and purified Moria's zombie hoard, Luffy and Sanji unfortunately got subdued by more of Perona's ghosts. Fortunately however, they were saved by the rest of the team before the zombies could get to them. Just as things were getting chaotic enough, [[Oars]], the zombie with Luffy's shadow, came crashing into the part of the building Luffy's team was in and separated part of the building as well as part of Luffy's team. With only Robin and Chopper left with him, Luffy and the two decided to continue towards Moria, seeing that the others would not be beaten so easily.{{Qref|chap=460|page=|ep=355|Luffy's team is separated by Oars amongst the chaos.}} As the three continued onwards, they were stopped in Moria's dance hall by [[Hogback]] and [[Victoria Cindry|Cindry]]. Fortunately, however, Robin and Chopper were able to hold those two off long enough for Luffy to slip pass them.

[[File:Luffy Confronts Moria.png|thumb|210px|Luffy meets [[Gecko Moria]] and demands him to return all of the shadows he stole.]]

Luffy finally reached Moria,{{Qref|chap=461|page=|ep=356|Luffy reaches Moria in the freezer.}} and after a short conversation, started attacking the Shichibukai. However, as soon as Luffy threw a punch, Moria used his own shadow, Doppelman, to fight in his stead. Undeterred by this seemingly invincible being, Luffy was still able to land a hit on Moria himself by attacking the Shichibukai from an indirect place.{{Qref|chap=463|page=|ep=357|Luffy begins fighting against Moria in the freezer.}} However despite using this tactic for some time, Luffy was still unable to land a direct clean hit on Moria. This continued until Oars came back to the freezer and started obeying Moria's orders fully. Once Moria gave Oars the order to completely annihilate all of the Straw Hats, the zombie began to attack Luffy. Luffy dodged the blow and started to chase after Moria, who had decided to run away from the chaos that was about to ensue.{{Qref|chap=469|page=|ep=364|Luffy starts chasing after Moria as Oars starts looking for the Straw Hats.}}

As Luffy chased after Moria, he was led deep within the forest of Thriller Bark. However, as Luffy was chasing Moria, the Shichibukai tricked Luffy into chasing Doppelman. Upon realizing what happened, Luffy was left stranded in the middle of forest. Seeing that dawn was fast approaching, Luffy immediately tried to find his way back to the Mast Mansion.{{Qref|chap=473|chap2=474|page=|ep=368|ep2=369|Luffy is led deep into Thriller Bark's forest and left there.}} However while running around lost in forest, Luffy encountered the group that the old man, [[Spoil]], was head of, the Thriller Bark Victim's Association. With some convincing by members of the association, the Risky Bros. of the Rolling Pirates, Luffy was told that they knew a way to beat Moria.{{Qref|chap=475|page=|ep=370|Luffy meets the Risky Brothers in the Thriller Bark forest.}}

Through some explanations by the Risky Brothers' captain [[Lola]], Luffy was told of the process of using captured shadows to power oneself up for ten minutes. Luffy was implanted with one hundred shadows that the Thriller Bark Victim's Association had collected over the years and became a vastly larger blue being that was dubbed "[[Kage Kage no Mi#Nightmare Luffy|Nightmare Luffy]]". With his newfound strength and skills bestowed by the shadows, Luffy rushed off to Mast Mansion, where Oars and Moria were battling against his crew and Brook.{{Qref|chap=476|page=|ep=370|Luffy becomes Nightmare Luffy.}}

[[File:Nightmare Luffy.png|thumb|left|210px|Nightmare Luffy saves Nami and Usopp from Oars and joins the fight.]]

Arriving just in the nick of time to save both Nami and Usopp from Oars, Luffy immediately started battling against the zombie. He easily overpowered him with his devastating attacks, wounding Moria as a result as well. With the execution of his final move, '''Gomu Gomu no Storm''', Luffy's ten minute limit was up. However, Luffy had inflicted so much damage onto Oars that the behemoth completely toppled over onto the Mast Mansion.{{Qref|chap=478|chap2=479|page=|ep=372|Nightmare Luffy devastates both Oars and Moria in battle.}}

Though Luffy was exhausted by having so many shadows implanted within him, the battle was still not over, for Oars rose back up to continue battling on. Despite their wounds, Luffy, his crew, and Brook rose back up as well and started one last combined attack against the zombie. While the rest of his crew began to restrict Oars' movements, Luffy was brought to top of Thriller Bark with help from Brook's high jumps and Robin's ability. At the top, Luffy was then thrown down towards a restricted Oars. As Luffy fell, he activated Gear 3 and landed a crippling blow to Oars, shattering the zombie's spine and rendering him incapable of moving anymore.{{Qref|chap=480|page=|ep=373|Luffy along with his crew and Brook perform one last move that shatters Oars' spine.}}

[[File:Gomu Gomu no Gigant Jet Shell.png|thumb|210px|Luffy using Gomu Gomu no Gigant Jet Shell to defeat Moria.]]

Despite Luffy's strong will within him, Oars was no longer able to move. However, while Oars was indeed finally defeated, Luffy and the other shadowless victims still had to get Moria to return all of their shadows before the rising dawn incinerated them. Unfortunately, despite receiving the blunt of Luffy's attack, Gecko Moria, managed to rise back up again and instead of giving back their shadows, the Shichibukai replied with his horrifying technique, '''Shadow's Asgard.''' Despite Moria's transformation into a giant monstrosity, time getting dangerously over before dawn, and all the fatigue and wounds from earlier, however, Luffy readied himself to fight Moria one last time. As Luffy battled against Moria to the limit with Gear 2 techniques that made Moria spew out some shadows, dawn was quickly approaching. Eventually, with time practically almost over, Luffy decided to stack his Gear transformations on top of one another in order to perform a reckless move, '''Gomu Gomu no Gigant Jet Shell''', to use against Moria. As Luffy attacked Moria with this move and just as the first signs of dawn started to incinerate both Luffy and the others, Luffy asked his own shadow to come back to him if it wanted to become [[Pirate King]]. Then with one last use of '''Gomu Gomu no Gigant Jet Shell '''Luffy was able to topple down Moria unable to hold his stolen shadows any longer. With this, Luffy's shadow and all of the other shadows of those on Thriller Bark returned to their original just in time to save them.{{Qref|chap=481|chap2=482|page=|ep=373|ep2=374|Luffy battles Moria one last time just as dawn finally arrives.}}

====Just Escaping the Tyrant's Clutches and Finally Getting a Musician====

[[File:Omae ni wa Jigoku o Miseru….png|thumb|left|210px|Kuma takes away Luffy's accumulated pain from his body.]]

With everyone's shadows finally returned and Moria finally defeated, Luffy collapsed from all the fatigue and pain he experienced from the night beforehand. While things seemed finally over, the celebration was however cut short with the arrival of [[Bartholomew Kuma]] in the scene. The second Shichibukai, having seen and reported the whole event to the World Government, was ordered to take out Luffy as well as eliminate everyone else on the island who witnessed Luffy's victory over Moria. A battle for an unconscious Luffy thus then ensued between the second Shichibukai and everyone else left standing willing to protect Luffy. In the end, Zoro asked if he could exchange his life for Luffy's. Impressed by Zoro's loyalty, Kuma pushed all of the pain from the battle from Luffy's body with his ability and implanted it into Zoro, to make him feel Luffy's pain.{{Qref|chap=483|chap2=485|page=|ep=375|ep2=377|Luffy is saved from being capture by Bartholomew Kuma while he is unconscious.}}

[[File:Luffy Asks Brook to Join Again.PNG|thumb|210px|During the victory celebration, Luffy asks [[Brook]] once again to join his crew.]]

After Kuma left and a day of rest went by, an energetic Luffy decided to celebrate their victory with everyone. As party went on, Luffy noticed Brook playing a familiar song on a piano. Remembering that this was a song that Shanks and his crew used to sing all the time, Luffy got into a conversation with Brook. As Brook played and the conversation went on, Luffy once again asked Brook to join his crew. Brook once again, turned down Luffy's offer since the skeleton had still some things to do. Knowing what he was talking about, Luffy revealed to Brook that not only did he learn about the skeleton's relationship with [[Laboon]], but also told him that Laboon was alive and well. Having told Brook this, Luffy touched Brook's heart and made the skeleton burst into tears of joy. As the party got more joyous with Brook bringing out a Tone Dial with the last musical performance of the Rumbar Pirates on it, Luffy was asked by Brook if he could join his crew. For this, Luffy casually agreed, much to the shock to most of his crew.

[[File:Straw Hats Celebrate Brook's Joining.png|thumb|left|210px|The Straw Hat crew as they cheer on their ship for their new member Brook.]]

With this very casual acceptance, Luffy finally got the musician he so longed for since his journey as a pirate began. After two days of recuperation, Luffy and his crew decided to leave Thriller Bark for Fish-Man Island. As they were about to leave, they were introduced to the concept of the [[Vivre Card]] by Lola. Remembering the piece of paper that Ace gave to him, Luffy took out the Vivre Card that his brother gave to him. Upon taking it out however, Luffy noticed that Ace's Vivre Card was burning a little and becoming smaller. With this, Luffy was explained that Ace's life was slowly vanishing. Dismissing the Vivre Card's state as Ace having his own adventure, Luffy and his crew sailed away from Thriller Bark and onto Fish-Man Island.{{Qref|chap=489|chap2=490|page=|ep=381|Luffy sees that Ace's Vivre Card is becoming smaller but dismisses it as him having his own adventure.}}{{-}}

==Summit War Saga==
===Sabaody Archipelago Arc===
====An Old Nemesis and the Man in the Iron Mask====
After several days of traversing the dangers and wonders of the Grand Line, the Straw Hats became overjoyed when they finally reached the [[Red Line]]. Luffy, Robin, and Brook attempted to get down to [[Fish-Man Island]] in the [[Shark Submerge III]], but the submarine could not go that far down and they were chased back up by a Sea Bunny. After returning to the Sunny, Luffy defeated the Sea Bunny with one punch, causing it to spit out a mermaid named [[Camie]] and a talking starfish named [[Pappag]] onto the Sunny's deck.{{Qref|chap=490|ep=385}}

To thank Luffy for saving her, Camie offered the Straw Hats some takoyaki. Luffy examined her and Pappag with great curiosity, not having realized he had already met a mermaid in [[Kokoro]]. He was eager to receive the takoyaki, but when Camie called her partner [[Hatchan]], she found out he had been kidnapped by the [[Macro Pirates]] and the [[Rosy Life Riders|Flying Fish Riders]]. Nami volunteered the crew to rescue him, and Luffy instantly agreed when he heard about Hatchan's takoyaki making skills. Camie called fish to direct them toward the Flying Fish Riders' hideout, and Luffy learned that the group was one of many kidnapping gangs around the [[Sabaody Archipelago]], being led by [[Duval]]. Some Flying Fish Riders then arrived and started attacking the Sunny, but quickly retreated.{{Qref|chap=491|ep=386}} The Sunny then reached the Flying Fish Riders' base, which appeared abandoned. The Straw Hats approached a cage containing Hatchan, and Luffy and his first four crewmates recognized him, becoming hesitant to rescue him. However, when Camie and Pappag went to save Hatchan and were caught by the Macro Pirates, the Straw Hats decided to save Hatchan as Luffy freed Camie and Pappag from the Macro Pirates' grasp.{{Qref|chap=492|ep=387}}

[[File:Duval and Motobaro vs Luffy.png|thumb|Luffy stops Duval and Motobaro.]]

The Flying Fish Riders then emerged from the ocean to attack, and Luffy hijacked one of the flying fish. However, the flying fish were then ordered to go underwater, forcing Luffy's crewmates to rescue him. One Flying Fish Rider charged toward the Sunny with a giant mace, and on Sanji's command, Luffy knocked out the fish while Sanji took down the rider, and Luffy put the fish on the deck to eat for dinner. Luffy watched as Brook put several more riders to sleep with his music, and tried hijacking another flying fish, but ended up crashing into Duval's room. In the room, Luffy saw Duval without his mask on before Duval put it on and confronted him.{{Qref|chap=493|ep=388}} Luffy was chased back outside by Duval and his bison [[Motobaro]], and as Duval angrily confronted Sanji, Luffy hit his mask off to reveal that Duval's face resembled the one on Sanji's wanted poster.{{Qref|chap=494|ep=388}}

Duval had the Flying Fish Riders put a steel net around Sanji before throwing him into the sea, and Zoro had to hold Luffy back from jumping in after him. Luffy then watched in awe as Camie raced to save Sanji, and Franky blew apart the Flying Fish Riders' base with the Sunny's [[Gaon Cannon]]. Duval then prepared to charge at Luffy with Motobaro, but with just a few words, Luffy managed to cause the bison to turn around and fall unconscious. Sanji then told Luffy to let him finish off Duval, and the former proceeded to do so.{{Qref|chap=495|ep=389}}

====Arrival at Sabaody: Defying the World Nobles====
[[File:Enjoyment at Sabaody Park.png|thumb|left|210px|Luffy and the others enjoy Sabaody Park.]]

Afterwards, the Straw Hats gorged on takoyaki that Hatchan, Camie, and Pappag made for them, and Duval and the newly renamed Rosy Life Riders came to thank them for Sanji changing Duval's face to give him a new appearance. After the meal, Pappag told the Straw Hats that they would need to give the Sunny a special coating to sail down to Fish-Man Island and into the [[New World]], and they could get this at the [[Sabaody Archipelago]]. They soon reached Sabaody, and Luffy marveled at the bubbles coming out of the ground. Hatchan said he would take the Straw Hats to a good coating mechanic, but insisted that they not defy any [[World Noble]]s they encountered.{{Qref|chap=496|ep=390}} Luffy, Chopper, and Brook went shopping with Camie, Pappag, and Hatchan, and eventually saw [[Devil Dias|a slave]] attempting to run away. However, the collar around the slave's neck then exploded, and when his masters Saint [[Shalria]] and Saint [[Rosward]] came up to him, they shot him. This enraged Luffy, but Pappag warned him that attacking a World Noble would result in a [[Marine]] [[admiral]] being summoned.{{Qref|chap=497|ep=391}}

Luffy's group was attacked by several [[Bounty Hunter|bounty hunters]], but he, Chopper, and Brook dispatched them with ease. They then arrived at Grove 13, where they entered Shakky's Rip-Off Bar to find the coater. The owner, [[Shakuyaku]], knew who Luffy and his crewmates were and figured they had come to find [[Rayleigh]] to coat their ship. She revealed that he had been away for six months, but said he liked to go to the Sabaody amusement park, revealing there were nine other pirates there with bounties over {{B}}100,000,000, including [[Eustass Kid|one man]] with a bounty higher than Luffy's.{{Qref|chap=498|ep=392}} Luffy's group then headed to Sabaody Park, where they enjoyed the rides and attractions. However, Camie ended up being kidnapped by the [[Hound Pets]] while the rest of the group went to get ice cream, and Luffy, Pappag, and Hatchan ran off to find her.{{Qref|name=c500|chap=500|ep=394}}

[[File:Luffy Punches Charlos.png|thumb|210px|Not tolerating Hatchan's injury, Luffy punches Saint Charlos.]]

The three of them searched Human Shops looking to find Camie, and Pappag and Hatchan told Luffy about the discrimination fish-men and merfolk faced here. The Rosy Life Riders then came to pick them up to bring them to the [[Human Auctioning House]] where Camie was being sold,{{Qref|name=c500}} and Luffy and his rider picked up Zoro on the way there. They ended up crashing through the door right as Camie was being sold onstage, and Luffy rushed to her despite Hatchan trying to hold him back. Luffy eventually got past Hatchan, but looked back and saw the fish-man being shot by the World Noble Saint [[Charlos]]. He then walked back up toward the two of them, and despite Hatchan's pleas not to go against the World Noble, Luffy went up to Charlos and punched him in the face, sending him crashing through several benches and knocking him unconscious.{{Qref|chap=502|ep=396}}

[[File:Pirate Captain.png|thumb|left|210px|Luffy, Kid, and Law confront the Marines.]]

Luffy apologized for going against Hatchan's orders, but his crew immediately joined him in attacking the guards and attempting to free Camie. During the chaos, Silvers Rayleigh came out from backstage and used [[Haoshoku Haki]] to knock out almost everyone, including all the guards and World Nobles, and he told Luffy he had been looking forward to meeting him.{{Qref|chap=503|ep=397}} Rayleigh freed Camie of her slave collar and said he would talk with Luffy later, as the Marines had surrounded the Auction House and Rayleigh had no intention of confronting them. The pirate [[Eustass Kid]] told his fellow supernovas Luffy and [[Trafalgar D. Water Law|Trafalgar Law]] that he and his crew would confront the Marines themselves, but the two of them immediately went out to join Kid. The Marines shot mortars at the three of them, but they each used their [[Devil Fruit]] powers to redirect the shots back at them.{{Qref|chap=504|ep=398}} The Supernovas then went on the offensive, and decided to meet back up in the New World as their crews joined them in decimating the Marines before heading off separately.{{Qref|chap=505|ep=399}}

====Destruction of the Straw Hat Crew====
The Straw Hats and their allies went with Rayleigh, where they parted ways with the Rosy Life Riders before going back to Shakky's bar. Rayleigh revealed that he was [[Gol D. Roger]]'s first mate, and told the Straw Hats the truth about Roger's final voyage and execution.{{Qref|chap=506|ep=400}} When Usopp asked Rayleigh about the [[One Piece]], Luffy loudly stopped him, not wanting to have the treasure spoiled for him. Rayleigh liked Luffy's attitude and agreed to coat the Sunny for free, saying it would take him three days. The Straw Hats received a Vivre Card from Rayleigh to reunite with him at that time, and they headed out with the objective to survive the Marine onslaught until then.{{Qref|chap=507|ep=400|ep2=401}}

[[File:Luffy Fighting Kuma.png|thumb|Luffy fighting Kuma.]]

However, the Straw Hats were immediately confronted by a [[Pacifista]] that they mistook for [[Bartholomew Kuma]]. The Pacifista shot a beam at them, and after finding out who Kuma was and what he did on [[Thriller Bark]], Luffy decided to go all out as he activated [[Gear 2]].{{Qref|chap=508|ep=401}} Luffy, Zoro, and Sanji performed some of their strongest attacks simultaneously on the Pacifista, but only knocked it into a building without damaging it much.{{Qref|chap=509|ep=402}} It soon got back up and overwhelmed Zoro, but the Straw Hats unleashed consecutive powerful attacks on it, ending with Luffy's '''Gomu Gomu no Gigant Rifle''', which successfully took it down.{{Qref|chap=510|ep=402|ep2=403}}

The Straw Hats tried to rest, only to be immediately confronted by the Marine Science Unit Commander, [[Sentomaru]], and another Pacifista, [[PX-1]]. Since they were in no shape to continue fighting, Luffy decided to have the crew split up and run away, telling them to reunite at the Sunny in three days. Luffy ran off with Robin and Chopper, but Sentomaru confronted them, and he used [[Busoshoku Haki]] in his palm strikes to hurt Luffy. Luffy then saw the Marine Admiral [[Borsalino|Kizaru]] attacking Zoro, but before Kizaru could finish Zoro off, Rayleigh came in and intercepted his attack.{{Qref|chap=511|ep=403|ep2=404}}

[[File:Luffy Cries Over Loss of Crew.png|thumb|left|210px|Luffy cries over the loss of his crew.]]

Luffy told Usopp and Brook to take Zoro and run away, knowing that all of them were too weak to beat the enemies in front of them. However, he watched as his crewmates were overwhelmed by PX-4 while he was slammed into the ground by Sentomaru. In the midst of this onslaught, the real Bartholomew Kuma appeared, and Luffy watched as he transported Zoro to another place.{{Qref|chap=512|ep=404}} Sentomaru told Luffy what Kuma had done, and after Kuma transported PX-1 away as well, Luffy yelled at his crew again to run, as it was all they could do at this point. However, it was not enough as Kuma sent Brook, Usopp, and Sanji flying away as well. Kuma repelled an attack from Luffy before sending Franky and Nami away, and Luffy was unable to do anything as the Shichibukai finished the job, making Chopper and Robin disappear. With everyone gone, Luffy started breaking down over his inability to save his crewmates, and Kuma told him that they would not see each other again as he sent Luffy away from Sabaody.{{Qref|chap=513|ep=405}}

===Amazon Lily Arc===
Luffy was sent flying upon Kuma's touch, and flew for days until he landed on the island [[Amazon Lily]]. He decided to use Rayleigh's [[Vivre Card]] to head back to Sabaody, but collapsed after running into a cliff face and unsuccessfully trying to destroy it. After killing and eating a boar, Luffy found some mushrooms and ate those as well. However, he ate a [[Body Mushroom]], which caused mushrooms to grow from his body and threaten his life. He was discovered by [[Marguerite]], [[Sweet Pea]], and [[Aphelandra]], and they took him to the village. There, they burned the mushrooms off of Luffy and took him to the river to wash him. There, when Sweet Pea mistook Luffy's crotch for a mushroom, [[Gloriosa|Elder Nyon]] revealed to the citizens, who were all females, that Luffy was a man.{{Qref|chap=514|ep=408}}

Luffy was put in a cell, and after waking up, he took back his straw hat from the Amazon Lily citizens as they ogled at him. They gave him some clothes, and when he reacted negatively to their feminine design, the women got angry and decided to execute him. Intent on returning to his crew, Luffy destroyed the roof of his cell with a kick and escaped. After being slammed to the ground by Apelandra, Luffy realized he needed to recover Rayleigh's Vivre Card from his trousers. Upon seeing Marguerite with them, he grabbed her and scaled the cliff around the village, returning to the woods. Marguerite gave him the Vivre Card, and after Luffy revealed that he was a pirate, Marguerite told him about their empress [[Boa Hancock]] who was also a pirate.{{Qref|chap=515|ep=409}} Marguerite helped Luffy remove the frills from his clothes, and he asked if she could give him a boat to leave, to which she replied that Amazon Lily was located in the [[Calm Belt]]. Luffy decided to build a raft, but it quickly fell apart, and after saving him, Marguerite decided to kill him to avoid becoming attached.{{Qref|chap=516|ep=410}}

[[File:Luffy Interrupts Hancock's Bath.png|thumb|194px|Luffy sees Hancock's back.]]

Luffy dodged Marguerite's arrows, which possessed considerable power due to being imbued with [[Busoshoku Haki]], and the latter's comrades arrived to reinforce her. Luffy manage to escape by climbing back up the mountain overlooking the village, and he decided to find an important person to help him by going to a tall building. He jumped onto the roof of Hancock's palace, but ended up breaking through it and falling into Hancock's bath, where he saw a mark on her back.{{Qref|chap=517|ep=411}} Hancock's sisters [[Boa Sandersonia]] and [[Boa Marigold]] then came in, and the three of them said Luffy would have to die for seeing Hancock's back. Hancock attempted to turn Luffy to stone with her [[Mero Mero no Mi]] powers, which had no effect on Luffy as he mistook them for [[Foxy]]'s [[Noro Noro no Mi|Noro Noro]] beams. Luffy then jumped out of the palace, but was shot by Hancock's kiss and was captured by the Kuja upon falling to the ground.{{Qref|name=c518|chap=518|ep=412}}

[[File:Saragi no Mai.png|thumb|left|Luffy faces off against Marigold and Sandersonia in their human-snake forms.]]

Luffy was put into an arena, and Hancock refused to believe his account of how he got to Amazon Lily. Marguerite, Sweet Pea, and Aphelandra then pleaded on Luffy's behalf, but Hancock turned them to stone. She then released the panther [[Bacura]] to attack Luffy, but Luffy defeated it with one punch. Luffy was enraged with the spectators for laughing at Hancock's actions toward Marguerite's group, being unaffected by Hancock's charms. Hancock then sent Sandersonia and Marigold to the ring to kill Luffy,{{Qref|name=c518}} and they used their Devil Fruit powers to transform into snakes. Luffy struggled against the two sisters as they dodged his attacks with [[Kenbunshoku Haki]] and hurt him with Busoshoku Haki, and they decided to punish him further by destroying the statues of Marguerite's group. Luffy desperately yelled at them to stop, which unbeknownst to him exerted [[Haoshoku Haki]] that stopped the Gorgon Sisters in their tracks and knocked out several Kuja in the audience.{{Qref|chap=519|ep=413}}

[[File:Luffy Defeats Sandersonia and Marigold With Gomu Gomu no Jet Gatling.png|thumb|210px|Luffy defeats the Gorgon Sisters with Gomu Gomu no Jet Gatling.]]

Deciding to go all-out, Luffy activated [[Gear 2]], and its speed was enough to overwhelm Sandersonia's Kenbunshoku Haki as well as overpower Marigold's Busoshoku Haki. The Gorgon Sisters then unleashed their ultimate attacks as Sandersonia turned her hair into Yamata no Orochi and Marigold turned hers into flaming salamanders, but Luffy destroyed all of them with '''Gomu Gomu no Jet Gatling''' and managed to tie the sisters' tails together, sending Sandersonia falling towards the spiked pit around the arena. She grabbed the edges of the arena, and Luffy realized that her clothes had been burned off, causing him to climb on her exposed back to cover the mark on it. After realizing what he had done, Hancock had the Kuja evacuate the arena.{{Qref|chap=520|ep=414}}

Hancock told Luffy that she would either return Marguerite's group to normal or give him a way to leave the island, and Luffy chose the former, becoming overjoyed when Marguerite was de-petrified. Luffy was taken back to Hancock's palace, and inside a chamber, Hancock revealed that the mark on her back was the Hoof of the Soaring Dragon, which signified that one was a slave of the [[World Noble]]s. She revealed that she and her sisters were once slaves on [[Mary Geoise]] before being freed, and the Kuja believed the marked spots to be cursed Gorgon's eyes because of the mark's shame. Having taken a liking to Luffy after finding out that he had attacked a World Noble, Hancock offered to take him wherever he wanted to go.{{Qref|chap=521|ep=415}}

[[File:Luffy's Decision.png|thumb|left|210px|Luffy makes the tough decision of putting his brother's life before reuniting with his crew.]]

After requesting to go to Sabaody starting the next day, Luffy partied with the Kuja, but had to run away after they started wanting to touch him. He came to Elder Nyon, who revealed that Hancock was a member of the [[Shichibukai]]. Nyon then told him the news about [[Ace]]'s imprisonment and impending execution, and a shocked Luffy decided to put his return to the crew on hold to save his brother. Nyon told him that it would take a week to reach [[Impel Down]] with a pirate ship, but a Marine ship could get there in four days. This caused Luffy to request that Hancock accept the Marines' summons to come to Ace's execution, and Hancock, who unbeknownst to Luffy was afflicted by [[Love Sickness]] for him, readily agreed.{{Qref|chap=522|ep=416}} Luffy hid under Hancock's robes as she boarded the Marine battleship, and made arrangements to stop at Impel Down.{{Qref|chap=523|ep=417}}

===Impel Down Arc===
====On the Loose in the World Government's Greatest Prison====
Luffy hid in Hancock's room as the Marine battleship headed for Impel Down, and she requested large meals so he could eat. As they arrived at the great prison, Luffy was awed by the number of battleships stationed there. He hid under Hancock's mantle as she disembarked and headed for the prison, but she revealed to him that the workers would be doing a full body check of her.{{Qref|chap=525|ep=422}} Upon entering the prison and going to be inspected, Hancock petrified the vice head jailer [[Domino]] and the security cameras to allow Luffy to go in undetected, and she made him promise to not cause too much ruckus. Luffy hid in the ceiling rafters as Hancock was accompanied into the prison.{{Qref|chap=526|ep=422}}

[[File:Luffy and Buggy Team Up.png|thumb|210px|Luffy and [[Buggy]] teaming up together.]]

Luffy followed Ace's Vivre Card, and snuck through a gate to Level 1 after it was opened by some guards chasing a prisoner. The prisoners in Level 1 begged Luffy to free them when Luffy noticed [[Buggy]] being chased by the [[Blugori]]. Intent on not getting caught, Luffy and Buggy worked together to attack the Blugori.{{Qref|chap=526|ep=423}} Luffy ended up defeating all five Blugori, and asked Buggy to help him get to Level 5 where he believed Ace was. Buggy initially refused, but then agreed with the condition that he receive Captain [[John]]'s armband on Luffy's arm. Luffy decided to give Buggy the armband immediately, but in their race down the corridor Buggy ended up crashing into the wall. Thinking they needed to go through the wall, Luffy punched through it, sending him and Buggy into the guards' room before breaking through another wall into a forest of spikes. Luffy flew on Buggy's back over the spiked floor until they reached a pit leading to Level 2, which was filled with stronger criminals and worse tortures. Luffy immediately jumped into the pit, with Buggy following him soon after.{{Qref|chap=527|ep=424}}

Upon arriving at Level 2, Luffy and Buggy immediately encountered the [[Basilisk]], which Luffy managed to defeat with [[Gear 3]]. The prisoners then asked the duo to free them, and Luffy angrily pulled Buggy aside when the latter did that instead of helping him. Buggy admitted that he had no idea how to get to Level 3 and that he was planning on ditching Luffy, only to renege on this statement when all of the prisoners he freed had abandoned him. [[Galdino]], formerly known as Mr. 3, then came and offered to help them.{{Qref|chap=528|ep=425}} The trio were later chased by multiple other beasts, including the bosses of the level, the [[manticore]]s. Galdino found out that Luffy was attempting to go deeper rather than escape and unsuccessfully tried to leave, causing him to take Luffy to a staircase going to Level 3. The staircase was guarded by the [[Sphinx]], which Luffy only made angrier with his attacks. Galdino distracted the Sphinx with wax replicas of himself, but its attacks caused the floor to cave in, sending it and Luffy's group down to Level 3.{{Qref|chap=529|ep=430}}

[[File:Bon Kurei and Luffy Team Up.png|thumb|left|210px|Luffy teams up with [[Bentham|Mr. 2 Bon Kurei]] to get down to the lower levels.]]

Luffy, Buggy, Galdino, and the Sphinx landed in Level 3, a dry and hot wasteland known as "Starvation Hell". However, they were swiftly caught in a giant net made of [[Seastone]] and confronted by the chief guard [[Saldeath]]. Their entrapment did not last long, though, as the Sphinx regained consciousness and tore apart the net. Luffy saw that Buggy and Galdino had gone up to try to escape, and he thanked them for bringing him here as he proceeded to fight through the Blugori and Sphinx on his way to Level 4.{{Qref|chap=530|ep=431}} Luffy got away from the scuffle, but had to deal with some guards and traps before being confronted again by the Sphinx. However, Luffy then saw [[Bentham|Mr. 2 Bon Kurei]], with [[Roronoa Zoro|Zoro]]'s face, leap in and attack the beast. Working together, Luffy and Bon Kurei defeated the Sphinx, and they happily embraced as Bon Kurei stated that he wanted to find someone on Level 5 as well.{{Qref|chap=531|ep=432}}

[[File:Gomu Gomu no Jet Bazooka.png|thumb|210px|Luffy uses '''Gomu Gomu no Jet Bazooka''' to defeat Minotaurus.]]

Luffy and Bon Kurei fought through more Blugori before being confronted by the [[Minotaurus]] of the [[Jailer Beasts]]. The two of them were initially injured by Minotaurus' spiked club, but Luffy used '''Jet Bazooka''' to send it flying a great distance away. Bon Kurei then guided Luffy to a well tower that overlooked Level 4, a blazing inferno that created the heat in Level 3. Luffy asked Bon Kurei whom he wanted to find, and the latter replied that he wished to meet [[Emporio Ivankov|Iva]] the [[okama]] queen. However, they were then joined by Buggy and Galdino, who were being chased by Minotaurus. Each member of the party used strong attacks on it, concluding with Luffy reinforcing his arm with Galdino's '''Candle Lock''' to defeat the beast.{{Qref|chap=532|ep=433}} Luffy and Bon Kurei prepared to head into Level 4, much to Buggy and Galdino's horror. However, the floor fell out from under them as a result of their attacks, causing all of them to plunge down to Level 4.{{Qref|name=c533|chap=533|ep=434}}

====A Near-Death Experience====

[[File:Monkey D. Luffy Hits Magellan With Gomu Gomu no Jet Bazooka.png|thumb|left|210px|Luffy sacrifices his arms to poison and attacks Magellan with '''Jet Bazooka'''.]]

After avoiding landing in the boiling pool of blood, Luffy decided to race in the direction of the kitchen because of its good smell, and Bon Kurei followed him. However, after defeating several more guards, Luffy was confronted by the warden [[Magellan]].{{Qref|name=c533}} Bon Kurei warned him to run away from Magellan and his [[Doku Doku no Mi]], and Luffy was forced to run away from Magellan's poisonous hydra heads. He swung across a flaming pit to get away, but Magellan spit a poison ball at him that created an explosion and overwhelmed his senses. Magellan then moved through a poison pathway to get to Luffy, and Luffy dodged his attacks as he continued to be afflicted by the poison ball. Intent on rescuing Ace, Luffy then went on the offensive and hit Magellan with '''Jet Bazooka''', but this resulted in his arms being covered with Magellan's poison.{{Qref|chap=534|ep=435}}

[[File:Luffy Defeated by Magellan.png|thumb|Luffy defeated by Magellan.]]

Luffy attempted to attack Magellan further, but was always met with the warden's poisonous creations and eventually hit by more poison. Magellan also breathed poisonous mist into the air, disorienting Luffy and causing his attacks to fly into empty space. Luffy kept fighting for as long as he could, but was eventually overwhelmed by the vast number of poisons in his body. At Magellan's command, he was brought into the freezing wasteland of Level 5 to die.{{Qref|chap=535|ep=436|ep2=437}} After regaining consciousness, Luffy tried crawling toward Ace and refused to die, but could barely move and quickly passed out again. Bon Kurei then found him and dragged him to try to find Iva, but was attacked by wolves. However, Luffy came to and bit a wolf as he proceeded to [[Haki/Haoshoku Haki|knock all of them out with a shout]] before passing out again.{{Qref|chap=536|ep=437|ep2=438}}

Luffy and Bon Kurei were found by [[Emporio Ivankov]], the "Iva" Bon Kurei was looking for, as well as [[Inazuma]]. Luffy pleaded with Ivankov to save Bon Kurei, causing Ivankov to decide to help Luffy as well.{{Qref|chap=537|ep=438}} Ivankov took Luffy to Level 5.5, his "Newkama Land", and had Luffy chained to a platform as he explained his treatment: by taking away ten years from Luffy's life, he would give him a slim chance of surviving the poison. He then injected healing hormones into Luffy, and Luffy was consumed by pain and anguish; Inazuma projected it would last for two and a half days. However, Luffy managed to successfully complete the process in 20 hours, and he pressed against the door keeping him in the chamber as he was desperately hungry.{{Qref|chap=538|ep=439|ep2=440}}

Luffy ate days' worths of rations for over 30 minutes before he fully recovered, and he thanked Ivankov and Bon Kurei for saving him and propelling him to recovery. He asked if Ivankov was going to escape now, and Ivankov said the time was not right yet, but Luffy then revealed that [[Monkey D. Dragon|Dragon]] was his father, astonishing Ivankov who revealed that he was a comrade of Dragon's in the [[Revolutionary Army]]. Ivankov then agreed to accompany Luffy to rescue Ace, and injected adrenaline hormones into Luffy that would keep him active for a day. Luffy, Ivankov, and Inazuma then headed out and raced through Level 5, beating the wolves in their way. They then approached and entered a gate leading to Level 6, a level shrouded in secrecy where Ace was being kept.{{Qref|chap=539|ep=441}}

====Escape from the Great Prison====
Luffy, Ivankov, and Inazuma fought their way to Level 6, only to find out that they were too late, with the prisoner [[Jinbe]] revealing that Ace had just been taken to be executed. The prison guards then blocked off the lift and the stairs and unleashed sleeping gas into the room, but Inazuma blocked the gas with his [[Choki Choki no Mi]] abilities, although this blocked off the stairs even more. Ivankov told Luffy that Ace was already on his way to Marineford and it was best to give up and let [[Whitebeard]] rescue him, but Luffy refused and was intent on going to Marineford. [[Crocodile]] then offered to help Luffy escape through the ceiling, and Luffy was surprised to see the former Shichibukai imprisoned here, refusing Crocodile's offer because of his actions on [[Arabasta]]. However, Ivankov told Luffy that he knew a secret about Crocodile that would keep him under control. Jinbe then asked Luffy to free him, saying he wanted to help save Ace as well, and Luffy agreed to this as his group freed Jinbe and Crocodile from their cells.{{Qref|chap=540|ep=442}}

[[File:Crocodile Luffy and Jinbe in Impel Down.png|thumb|left|210px|Luffy, Jinbe, and Crocodile rampaging their way through the levels to freedom.]]

Inazuma created a pathway to the ceiling with his powers, and the group broke through into Level 5. They then raced up the stairs to Level 4, and fought the guards there as they were joined by prisoners who were freed by Buggy and Galdino, as well as [[Daz Bonez]] who had been freed by his boss Crocodile.{{Qref|chap=541|ep=443}} Luffy was told to go on to Level 3 in the midst of this skirmish, but turned back as he saw the Jailer Beasts attacking the escaped prisoners, and he, Jinbe, and Crocodile defeated the Jailer Beasts all together at once.{{Qref|chap=542|ep=445}}

[[File:Luffy Uses Jet Pistol on Blackbeard.png|thumb|Luffy attacks Blackbeard.]]

The group was then confronted by the chief guard [[Sadi]], but Ivankov threw Luffy forward to get him to keep going. Luffy was confronted by the vice warden [[Hannyabal]] who refused to let him past, and despite Luffy hitting him with multiple attacks, Hannyabal refused to go down and kept attacking. However, Hannyabal was then brought down by [[Marshall D. Teach]], and Luffy realized that he was the "Blackbeard" that had captured Ace.{{Qref|chap=543|ep=446}} Blackbeard said that fate was on Luffy's side when Ace prevented the former from hunting down the latter as he had originally intended, but Luffy responded by punching him. As Luffy charged to attack again, Blackbeard slammed him into the ground, injuring him with his [[Yami Yami no Mi]] abilities. Jinbe then prevented Luffy from attacking Blackbeard further, and Luffy was compelled to head for Level 3 as Blackbeard and [[Blackbeard Pirates|his crew]] went on to continue the execution of their plan.{{Qref|chap=544|ep=447}}

[[File:Whale Sharks.png|thumb|left|210px|Luffy and the prisoners finally escape on whale sharks summoned by Jinbe.]]

Luffy's group made it to Level 3, and stormed their way through the Impel Down forces to Level 2. While fighting the manticores, Luffy found out that Ivankov and Inazuma were facing Magellan and he wanted to go back and help, but was held back. His group then reunited with Buggy and Galdino right as Magellan arrived at Level 2, and Galdino used his wax to block the warden's 
poison hydra from hitting Luffy.{{Qref|chap=545|ep=448}} Luffy then got an idea to fight Magellan together with Galdino, and Galdino created wax armor to put around Luffy's arms and legs. Luffy then successfully punched Magellan, with the wax protecting him from the poison.{{Qref|chap=546|ep=449}} However, Magellan countered with Kinjite, a poison strong enough to destroy objects, forcing Luffy and Galdino to run away. They arrived at the outside of the prison, but Bon Kurei told Luffy that they had not managed to get a ship yet. Ivankov and Inazuma then arrived, having survived Magellan's poison, and Luffy got in contact with Jinbe, who told his group to jump into the sea. Luffy and Galdino worked together to force back Magellan's '''Venom Demon''', and Luffy had Ivankov blow all the prisoners toward the sea with his '''Hell Wink'''. When the prisoners were over the water, Jinbe called a school of whale sharks to carry them to the battleship that he had commandeered.{{Qref|chap=547|ep=450}}

Luffy and the prisoners celebrated as they reached the battleship, but soon found themselves under attack from the other Marine battleships. They then faced another problem as the [[Gates of Justice]] were closed, preventing them from leaving Impel Down. However, Jinbe continued ahead at full speed, and as the gate suddenly opened, he revealed to Luffy that Bon Kurei had stayed behind to open it. Luffy wanted to go back and rescue him, but Jinbe stated that this was impossible and leaving him behind was necessary. Jinbe then gave Luffy a [[Baby Den Den Mushi]] to contact Bon Kurei, and he and the other prisoners tearfully thanked him as their ship managed to get out of Impel Down right before the gate was closed.{{Qref|chap=548|ep=451}} As he wept over Bon Kurei, Luffy punched Buggy for taking the okama's fate lightly, and he also talked to Jinbe, whom he found out was a Shichibukai. [[Marine Headquarters]] then called the battleship, and Luffy answered it. They identified him and Buggy as the co-instigators of the prison break, and said that they would have no chance of reaching Marineford. However, Luffy declared that he would save Ace no matter what, and when Buggy was hailed by the prisoners after it was revealed that he had served on [[Gol D. Roger]]'s crew, he changed his mind and agreed to go with Luffy to Marineford as well.{{Qref|chap=549|ep=452}}

===Marineford Arc===
====The Fight Rages Without Him====
The Impel Down escapees' ship approached the Gates of Justice to Marineford,{{Qref|chap=550|ep=459}} and to their surprise, the gates were opened immediately.{{Qref|chap=551|ep=460}} [[Emporio Ivankov|Ivankov]] wondered if [[Monkey D. Dragon|Dragon]] would come to save [[Portgas D. Ace|Ace]], but Luffy revealed that Ace was not related to him by blood and that Ace's father was [[Gol D. Roger]]. Luffy tried looking for Marineford, but could not due to the thick fog.{{Qref|chap=552|ep=461}}

[[File:Impel Down Alliance Arrives.png|thumb|210px|Luffy and the other Impel Down prisoners finally arrive at Marineford.]]

The escapees' ship was suddenly carried by a giant wave heading toward Marineford created by [[Edward Newgate|Whitebeard]], but the wave was frozen right above the island by Admiral [[Kuzan|Aokiji]], leaving the escapees trapped on top of it. Luffy got the idea to free the battleship from the ice and slide down the back of the wave. However, after picking up a transmission revealing that Ace would be executed ahead of the scheduled time, the group tried to hurry and get the battleship out, which caused the ice below them to shatter and sent them plummeting straight down onto the frozen Marineford Bay. By sheer luck, they ended up crashing into a Marine battleship in a small unfrozen part of the bay, and Luffy stood on the battleship's wreckage as he called out to Ace.{{Qref|name=c557|chap=557|ep=466}}

[[File:Luffy's Declaration to Whitebeard.png|thumb|left|210px|Luffy declares he'll become Pirate King to Whitebeard.]]

[[Crocodile]] attempted to attack Whitebeard, but Luffy kicked the former [[Seven Warlords of the Sea|Warlord]] away due to Ace caring about Whitebeard. Whitebeard told Luffy that he would be throwing his life away trying to rescue Ace, but Luffy did not care and brashly told the [[Emperor]] that he would save Ace himself and become Pirate King, surprising Whitebeard and earning his respect.{{Qref|name=c557}} Luffy told Whitebeard that Ace's execution time had been moved up, addressing the Emperor like an equal, before running into the battlefield.{{Qref|name=c558|chap=558|ep=467}}{{-}}

====Objective: Save Ace!====
Luffy was immediately met by Admiral [[Borsalino|Kizaru]], but Ivankov redirected Kizaru's laser. As Luffy fought through dozens of Marines, [[Hina]] attempted to ensnare him, but Luffy used his speed to evade [[Ori Ori no Mi|her abilties]]. [[Gecko Moria]] then summoned a [[zombie]] army to attack Luffy, and Ace told Luffy to leave, claiming to not want his help. However, Luffy declared that he would rescue Ace and disregard any pirate code because he was Ace's little brother, and [[Jinbe]] took out Moria's zombies with a blast of seawater. As this occurred, Sengoku revealed to all that Luffy was just as dangerous as Ace since he is the son of [[Monkey D. Dragon|Revolutionary Dragon]]. Unfazed by his lineage being revealed, Luffy then took out a member of the Giant Squad with '''Gomu Gomu no Gigant Rifle''', saying he would save Ace even if it killed him.{{Qref|name=c558}}

[[File:Hancock Protects Luffy from Smoker.png|thumb|210px|Hancock protecting Luffy from Smoker.]]

Luffy continued fighting through the Marines, but right after forcing [[Tashigi]] aside, he was hit by [[Smoker]]'s jitte. Smoker used his [[Moku Moku no Mi]] powers to make Luffy's attacks pass through him before pinning Luffy down with his jitte, but he was then kicked away by [[Boa Hancock|Hancock]].{{Qref|chap=559|ep=468}} Hancock gave Luffy the key to Ace's handcuffs, and he happily embraced her before running off. He ran into Ivankov confronting [[Bartholomew Kuma]], and watched as the emotionless Shichibukai used his new [[Pacifista]] modifications to attack. Luffy kept running, but then encountered [[Dracule Mihawk]].{{Qref|chap=560|ep=469}}

[[File:Gomu Gomu no Jet Migawari.png|thumb|left|Luffy uses Gomu Gomu no Jet Migawari to dodge Mihawk's attack.]]

Luffy attempted to avoid Mihawk, but the Shichibukai kept pace and hit him with a spinning air slash. Some of Ivankov's followers attempted to protect Luffy from Mihawk, but Mihawk quickly beat them. Luffy attempted to attack Mihawk, but cut it short upon realizing that his arms would be cut off. Mihawk was impressed at his clear-headed attitude and swung his sword at Luffy, who ducked as he saw the slash cleave through the frozen wave far away. Luffy was forced to avoid Mihawk's slashes, but ended up getting farther from Ace. He then pulled Buggy in front of him to intercept Mihawk's attacks, and was able to run away when Buggy attempted to attack Mihawk. After this, Luffy saw [[Vista]] of the [[Whitebeard Pirates]] battling Mihawk.{{Qref|chap=561|ep=470}}

[[File:Borsalino Kicks Luffy.png|thumb|210px|Kizaru kicks Luffy at the speed of light.]]

Luffy saw that the Marines were going to execute Ace very soon, but was met by Kizaru and kicked away at the speed of light. He tumbled over to Jinbe and some of the Whitebeard Pirates' Division Commanders, and the commanders went to help Luffy by dealing with Kizaru. A short time later, Luffy watched in shock as Whitebeard was stabbed by his subordinate [[Squard]].{{Qref|chap=562|ep=471}} However, Whitebeard recovered and entered the fray, and Luffy was annoyed when the Emperor's [[Gura Gura no Mi]] abilities shifted the ground and almost made him fall into the water. Luffy reached the edge of the bay and attempted to pull himself up to land, but was unable to due to the Marines raising an encircling wall. Luffy then watched in awe as Admiral [[Sakazuki|Akainu]] unleashed magma meteors into the bay to melt the ice.{{Qref|chap=564|ep=473}}

[[File:Luffy Faces Three Admirals.png|thumb|left|210px|Luffy faces the three admirals.]]

Luffy raced toward an opening in the encircling wall, but was beaten back by the Marines lying in wait there. After landing near Ivankov and Jinbe, he asked them for a favor, and Jinbe sent him over the wall in a blast of seawater. Luffy landed in front of the three Marine admirals,{{Qref|chap=565|ep=474}} and although he could not harm them due to their Logia abilities, he activated Gear 2 to run past them. Kizaru quickly caught up to him and kicked him back, and Luffy was helpless as the executioners started to execute Ace. However, Crocodile took out the executioners, but Luffy was then attacked by Aokiji, who injured him with an ice spear. [[Marco]] of the Whitebeard Pirates stepped in and attacked Aokiji, allowing Luffy to go on.{{Qref|chap=566|ep=475}}

However, Luffy was overpowered by Vice Admirals [[Momonga]] and [[Dalmatian]] before being shot by Kizaru, who kicked him at light speed again. Luffy was caught by Whitebeard, who threw him to his subordinates for his wounds to be treated. Luffy refused to be sidelined, but soon collapsed from exhaustion.{{Qref|chap=567|ep=476}} Ivankov came up to him, and Luffy requested to be injected with Vigor Hormones again. Ivankov initially refused, but Luffy did not care about the dangerous consequences and so received the injection, giving his body energy it was not equipped to handle.{{Qref|chap=568|ep=477}}

[[File:Luffy Defeats Koby at Marineford.png|thumb|Luffy defeats Koby with Gomu Gomu no Bullet.]]

Luffy raced toward the execution platform again but was immediately confronted by [[Koby]], who was determined to stop him. However, Luffy dealt with Koby's [[Soru]] and defeated him with one punch. Luffy was then confronted by some [[Pacifista]], but he was shielded by Hancock, who the Pacifista were unable to attack. The executioners then attempted to execute Ace again, and Luffy, who was still too far away, yelled at them to stop, unwittingly unleashing a large burst of [[Haoshoku Haki]] that knocked them out.{{Qref|chap=569|ep=478}} More Marines began targeting Luffy, but more of the Whitebeard Pirates backed him up on orders from Whitebeard. Luffy was then attacked by Mihawk again, but Mihawk's strike was intercepted by [[Daz Bonez]] who along with Crocodile confronted him. As Luffy reached the bottom of the wall underneath the execution platform, [[Inazuma]] emerged from Ivankov's hair and created a ramp going up to the platform.{{Qref|name=c570|chap=570|ep=479}}

[[File:Luffy Hits Garp.png|thumb|left|210px|Garp allowing Luffy to strike him in order to rescue Ace.]]

Luffy ran up the ramp, but was confronted by his grandfather [[Monkey D. Garp|Garp]] who could not let him pass.{{Qref|name=c570}} Garp said Luffy would have to beat him to rescue Ace, and Luffy activated Gear 2 and punched his grandfather off the ramp. Garp's arrival caused the ramp to break, but Luffy jumped off the falling pieces and made it to the execution platform. There, he was confronted by Fleet Admiral [[Sengoku]], who turned into a [[Hito Hito no Mi, Model: Daibutsu|giant buddha]], and Kizaru destroyed the key to Ace's handcuffs with a beam. Luffy then saw [[Galdino]] stirring from unconsciousness next to Ace, and he told the former Baroque Works agent to create a wax wall around Ace while Sengoku prepared to punch him. Luffy absorbed Sengoku's punch with '''Gomu Gomu no Gigant Fusen''', and was pressed against the wax wall, causing the entire execution platform to start collapsing. As they were falling, Galdino gave Luffy a wax key to free Ace, and Luffy used it to unlock Ace's handcuffs, allowing Ace to shield them from the Marines' bazooka shots.{{Qref|chap=571|ep=480}}

====Uncontrollable Anguish: Luffy Collapses====

[[File:Ace and Luffy Fighting Against Marine Officers.png|thumb|210px|Luffy and Ace battle against the Marines.]]

Upon reaching the ground, Luffy and Ace worked in tandem to take down the Marines, and Ace protected Luffy from an attack by Aokiji. Luffy and Ace were then shocked as Whitebeard proclaimed that he would die to let everyone else escape.{{Qref|chap=572|ep=481}} Luffy was initially unable to get Ace to escape with him, but after Ace spoke with Whitebeard, the two brothers went on the move again. However, Ace made the mistake of turning around to confront Akainu after the admiral degraded Whitebeard, and as he watched the two fight, Luffy dropped Ace's [[Vivre Card]]. When he went to pick it up, Akainu swooped in to kill him, only for Ace to step in and take the blow.{{Qref|chap=573|ep=482}}

[[File:Ace's Bloody Death in the Manga.png|thumb|left|210px|Luffy's mind collapses from Ace's death.]]

Jinbe stepped in to prevent Akainu from attacking Ace again, and the heavily injured Ace fell into Luffy's arms. As Luffy called out for medical attention, Ace told him to greet [[Curly Dadan|Dadan]] for him and apologized that he would not see Luffy's dream come to fruition. He then thanked Luffy and the Whitebeard Pirates for loving him before passing away, and as he kneeled over Ace's dead body, Luffy suffered a complete mental breakdown.{{Qref|chap=574|ep=483}}

Jinbe took the incapacitated Luffy away to protect him from Akainu,{{Qref|chap=575|ep=484}} but they were confronted by the admiral again as they neared the bay.{{Qref|chap=577|ep=486}} Akainu managed to punch through Jinbe's body with a [[Magu Magu no Mi|magma fist]] and hit Luffy, severely injuring his chest. Crocodile then stepped in and sent Luffy and Jinbe up in the air with a sand cyclone, where they were unwittingly caught by Buggy.{{Qref|chap=578|ep=487}} Buggy took them to [[Trafalgar D. Water Law|Trafalgar Law]] and the [[Heart Pirates]], who had just arrived on their submarine the [[Polar Tang]], and [[Bepo]] took Luffy inside as the crew prepared to submerge. They were able to do so thanks to the intervention of Koby and the [[Red Hair Pirates]],{{Qref|chap=579|ep=488}} and despite last-ditch attacks by Aokiji and Kizaru, the Polar Tang made it out of Marineford as Luffy was laid on a table to receive medical attention.{{Qref|chap=580|ep=489}}

===Post-War Arc===
Luffy was next seen being treated for his injuries on Law's submarine. As he was being treated on Law's submarine, Law, Ivankov, Boa Hancock, and Jinbe commented on how much damage he had accumulated, and Jinbe worried about his reaction to all that had happened when he awakened. {{Qref|chap=581|page=|ep=490}}

[[File:Luffy Cries Over the Death of Ace.png|thumb|Luffy cries over the death of his brother, Ace.]]

After two weeks of recovering from his injuries, Luffy awakens in [[Amazon Lily]] and goes on a rampage blindly asking where Ace is. After remembering Ace's death little by little, while still destroying the rocks and the trees in the forest, he stops for a moment as Jinbe tries to explain to him that the war is over and Ace is dead. Luffy states he has realized that it wasn't a dream by pinching his cheek very hard and starts to finally cry and mourn over his loss. While weeping, he thinks back to when he first met Ace. After the flashback, he begins to doubt his abilities and starts to think about how he could possibly become the Pirate King if he is too weak.{{Qref|chap=589|page=|ep=504}} After that, Luffy has a little verbal and physical struggle against Jinbe who told him not to regret his brother's death, and that he has not lost everything yet. Luffy then remembers that he still has something priceless: his crew, and then declares that he wants to go to Sabaody Archipelago to meet his crewmates again.{{Qref|chap=590|page=|ep=505}}

Soon after that he meets Silvers Rayleigh and learns about his and Shakky's relationship with Nyon, Boa Hancock, and her sisters. Luffy asks if any of his crew had returned to Sabaody Archipelago, to which Rayleigh replied that they probably had not. After Rayleigh explained how he learned Luffy was on Amazon Lily, Rayleigh explains that if Luffy went back to Sabaody, the same tragic events he suffered would occur again. Luffy then starts to listen to a proposition Rayleigh has for him.{{Qref|chap=591|page=|ep=507}} Although no word left from Luffy and Rayleigh, the word about Luffy being alive is being spread throughout the world. However, there is something lingering within the newspaper regarding actions of Luffy.{{Qref|chap=593|page=|ep=510}}

[[File:Luffy Pays His Respects.png|thumb|left|210px|The article about Luffy's return to [[Marineford]] with a hidden message for his crew: the "<s>3D</s>2Y" tattoo on his right arm with the "3" and "D" crossed out.]]

The article revealed that Luffy actually infiltrated Marineford a second time, accompanied by Jinbe and Rayleigh. After they stole a Marine ship, they circled Marineford once, which according to Lieutenant Commander Brannew is a custom for burials at sea. Luffy then went into the plaza alone and rang the [[Ox Bell]] sixteen times, threw a bouquet of flowers into the rubble, and then bowed his head in silent prayer, leaving promptly after. His goal from this was to send the message: 3D2Y to the other Straw Hats, meaning that they would meet in Sabaody Archipelago not in three days, but in two years.

Luffy is later seen on the Kuja Pirates' ship, resting so he can recover from his injuries. The other Kuja pirates are all at his bedside, watching him under Hancock's orders while playing with his stretchy skin. Luffy then says that he hopes that his message reached his crewmates. Rayleigh then assured him that it would, since it was highly unlike him. Jinbe eventually left the Kuja ship while riding a whale shark after Luffy and Jinbe gave their thanks to each other and Jinbe tells him that he will continue to aid Luffy later on in the future and that he looks forward to meeting Luffy and his crew 2 years from now.

Luffy eventually arrives on [[Rusukaina]], a deserted island northwest of Amazon Lily, with the Kuja and Rayleigh where he will train with Rayleigh alone. Rayleigh explains the three forms of Haki while demonstrating them on a rampaging elephant. The demonstration excites Luffy and makes him eager to learn them. Luffy then puts his hat on a stone, which is the only safe spot on the dangerous island, with the vivre card while saying that he will take a vacation from being a pirate for sometime.

==During the Timeskip==
===Training===
At some point in the time skip, Luffy developed [[Gomu Gomu no Mi/Gear 4 Techniques|Gear 4]] in order to help him subdue the beasts on [[Rusukaina]].{{Qref|chap=784|page=6-19|ep=726|Luffy fights Doflamingo using Gear 4.}} He later asked [[Silvers Rayleigh|Rayleigh]] how to improve his attack power with it, and Rayleigh warned him about the consequences of using it. However, Luffy later learned how to properly utilize Gear 4.{{Qref|chap=790|page=10|ep=733|Luffy recalls training with Rayleigh to improve his own Haki.}}

[[File:Rayleigh Training Luffy.png|thumb|left|200px|Rayleigh training Luffy to use Haki.]]

While teaching [[Haki/Kenbunshoku Haki|Kenbunshoku Haki]] to Luffy, Rayleigh challenged Luffy to dodge 100 times while blindfolded or he would not be allowed to eat. When Luffy was attacking blindly, he accidentally hit Rayleigh's dinner, causing him to hit Luffy. While lying on the ground hungry, some animals gave him food, but Luffy refused to eat what they offered. During a later conversation, Rayleigh remarked on how Luffy was proficient in sensing the feelings of living things. He also mentioned that there are people who can see a glimpse into the future and asked Luffy what would he do if he met one of these people.{{Qref|chap=894|page=2-5|ep=869}}

After teaching Luffy the basics of [[Haki]], Rayleigh informed him that Haki grows stronger when one faces a stronger opponent.{{Qref|chap=886|page=19|ep=860}}

===Return to Sabaody Arc===
[[File:Straw Hat Luffy is Back.png|thumb|left|200px|Straw Hat Luffy is back.]]

When the two years of training were up, Luffy was called by the Gorgon Sisters, Nyon, and Marguerite, who had prepared a ship for him to sail to Sabaody. Luffy collected his straw hat and bid farewell to the animals, who were now his friends.{{qref|chap=598|page=1-3|ep=517}}

Upon arriving near Sabaody, Hancock gave Luffy a coat to shroud himself as well as a large backpack with an obscene amount of supplies. Luffy bid farewell to her and the Kuja, promising to see them again as he headed for land on a rowboat.{{qref|name=c599|chap=599|page=2-7|ep=518}} After landing, Luffy accidentally bumped into [[Demaro Black]], who unbeknownst to him was impersonating him.{{qref|chap=598|page=24}} This made Black extremely angry and, not recognizing Luffy, he held the pirate at gunpoint and told him to prostrate himself for forgiveness. Luffy shrugged him off, causing him to pull the trigger, but Luffy dodged the bullet with ease using [[Haki/Kenbunshoku Haki|Kenbunshoku Haki]] before unleashing a blast of [[Haki/Haoshoku Haki|Haoshoku Haki]] that knocked Black, as well as the rest of his [[Fake Straw Hat Crew]], unconscious.{{qref|name=c599}}

Luffy then ran into [[Manjaro]] and [[Drip]], who were impersonating [[Roronoa Zoro|Zoro]] and [[Sanji]] in Black's crew, and mistook them for the real item. Recognizing him as the one who attacked Black, the duo took Luffy to Grove 46 where their captain was gathering new recruits.{{qref|chap=600|page=5, 11|ep=519|ep2=520}} Luffy was brought onstage to be made an example of, but the event was suddenly disrupted by the arrival of the [[Marines]] and [[Pacifista]] led by [[Sentomaru]]. Luffy discovered that Black had been impersonating him, and the Pacifista PX-5 began targeting him after Black's defeat, revealing the real Luffy to the crowd. However, Luffy dodged PX-5's laser blast before hitting its face into the ground, causing it to explode. The real Zoro and Sanji then arrived and defeated another Pacifista, and Luffy greeted them before seeing Rayleigh off in the distance; Rayleigh told him to get to his crew, and Luffy proclaimed to the Dark King that he would become the Pirate King.{{qref|chap=601|page=3-19|ep=521}}

[[File:Straw Hats Reunion.png|thumb|left|Luffy, Zoro, and Sanji reunite with the rest of the crew.]]

Aided by [[Perona]] and a [[Animal Species/Summit War Saga#Masukeredomo Goayu Birds|Masukeredomo Goayu Bird]] from the [[Torino Kingdom]], Luffy, Zoro, and Sanji reached the [[Thousand Sunny]] and Luffy reunited with the rest of his crew. They quickly found themselves under attack by a Marine battleship, but the Kuja arrived to intercept it. As the [[coating]] began to take effect for the Sunny to submerge, Luffy thanked his crew for going with his request to train for two years and shouted to set sail as their voyage to [[Fish-Man Island]] was now beginning.{{qref|chap=602|ep=522}}

===Fish-Man Island Arc===
====The Undersea Voyage====
The Straw Hats admired the wonders under the sea and learned how the coating bubble worked. [[Franky]] told the others that [[Hatchan]] had been wounded and would be waiting for them on Fish-Man Island; he then revealed that [[Bartholomew Kuma]] had taken over protecting the Sunny during their training for reasons that were mostly unknown, but may have involved his ties to the [[Revolutionary Army]].{{qref|chap=603|page=7-17|ep=523}} The Straw Hats were then attacked by the [[Caribou Pirates]], whose [[Numabou|ship]] was being pulled by [[Momoo]]. However, when Momoo saw Luffy and Sanji he became fearful and fled, allowing only Caribou to board the Sunny. The Straw Hats promptly tied him up and began preparing to ride the [[Sea Currents|currents]] down into the deep sea. As they started plummeting down, they encountered a giant kraken, and Luffy got the idea to tame it and have it pull their ship.{{qref|chap=604|ep=524}}

[[File:Gomu Gomu no Elephant Gun.png|thumb|left|210px|Luffy uses Gomu Gomu no Elephant Gun to defeat the kraken.]]

To keep the kraken at bay without threatening the Sunny's coating, Caribou had Luffy, Zoro, and Sanji wear smaller bubbles around them that would allow them to move and breathe away from the ship. The trio headed out, and after Zoro and Sanji attacked the kraken's tentacles, Luffy unleashed a Gear 3 punch hardened with [[Haki/Busoshoku Haki|Busoshoku Haki]] called ''Gomu Gomu no Elephant Gun'' which knocked the kraken unconscious with a single blow. However, the trio were then pulled down by the current into the [[Underworld of the Sea]] before they could return to the Sunny.{{qref|chap=605|ep=525}} Luffy and Sanji's bubbles popped, but they managed to get into Zoro's bubble and narrowly evade death. Luffy successfully tamed the kraken and gave it the name [[Surume]], and had it attack the giant fish-man [[Wadatsumi]] after finding him threatening the rest of the crew. Luffy, Zoro, and Sanji returned to the Sunny and had Surume carry it to Fish-Man Island.{{qref|chap=606|page=14-15|ep=526}}

Their voyage was soon threatened again by the eruption of an undersea volcano, causing a landslide as Surume took the Sunny down the final trench. [[Usopp]] managed to hold back most of the avalanche with his special [[Pop Green]] ammunition, but a rock hit Surume on the head and knocked him out, causing the Sunny to sink down to the ocean floor.{{qref|chap=607|ep=526}}

====Trouble in the Underwater Paradise====
The Straw Hats were unharmed following this and celebrated upon seeing Fish-Man Island a short distance away. However, they were then confronted by [[Hammond]], who told the Straw Hats to submit to his crew the [[New Fish-Man Pirates]] or be attacked. The Straw Hats quickly planned to blast into Fish-Man Island with Coup de Burst, and Luffy bluntly rejected Hammond's demand.{{qref|chap=607|ep=527}} Hammond had his [[Sea Beast]] army attack in response, but the Straw Hats were able to blast away just in time. They went through a barrier that stripped the remaining coating off the Sunny before entering another layer of seawater, which swept the whole crew off the ship in different directions and left the Devil Fruit users powerless.{{qref|name=c608|chap=608|ep=527}}

Luffy, Usopp, Sanji, and Chopper were rescued by [[Camie]] and the [[Medaka Mermaid Quintuplets]] and taken to the former's apartment where they eventually regained consciousness. Camie took them up to show them around Fish-Man Island and meet [[Pappag]] at his mansion in [[Gyoverly Hills]], and they first stopped at [[Mermaid Cove]].{{qref|name=c608}} While there, Luffy told Camie that he wanted to see [[Jinbe]] on the island, but she revealed that he had left. The three princes of the [[Ryugu Kingdom]], the Neptune Brothers, then suddenly came to the cove to search for the Straw Hats. Camie and the mermaids attempted to hide them, but Sanji had a massive nosebleed which exposed the pirates and left him critically short of blood. Hammond and his crewmates [[Hyouzou]] and [[Kasagoba]] then arrived as Luffy asked for someone to donate blood, and Hammond told him that even though humans and fish-men had the same blood, it was illegal for the races to give each other transfusions. He then fired a net at Luffy, but Luffy easily dodged it with Gear 2 before knocking out the three pirates with a single strike. Hammond's Sea Squirrel then charged at Luffy, but he stopped it with just a look. Camie told the Straw Hats to join her onboard the Neptune Brothers' ship [[Ryugu]], and they got on and headed for town.{{qref|chap=609|ep=528}}

The group arrived at the port town [[Coral Hill]] and desperately looked for any humans with Sanji's rare blood type. They finally found [[Splash and Splatter|two okama]] who agreed, and Sanji recovered in Madame [[Shyarly]]'s room. Luffy noticed a nick on his arm and realized he had been poisoned by Hyouzou; however, he was unaffected due to immunity built up after his fight with [[Magellan]]. Luffy, Usopp, and Camie headed to the Mermaid Cafe, where they ran into Brook and Pappag. Pappag then took them to his home via Fish Taxi, and they passed by a candy factory with the [[Big Mom Pirates]]' [[Jolly Roger|jolly roger]] on it; Pappag explained that the [[Four Emperors|Emperor]] [[Charlotte Linlin|Big Mom]] now protected the island following [[Edward Newgate|Whitebeard]]'s death, but demanded large amounts of candy in return.{{qref|chap=610|ep=529}} The group arrived at Pappag's mansion and reunited with Nami at a [[Criminal]] store; Pappag allowed them to take whatever they wanted from it. King [[Neptune]] then arrived unexpectedly and invited the Straw Hats to his palace.{{qref|chap=611|ep=530}}

[[File:Luffy Encounters Shirahoshi.png|thumb|210px|Luffy meets the Mermaid Princess.]]

The Straw Hats rode aboard [[Megalo]], a shark belonging to Neptune's daughter whom they had unwittingly saved from Surume, and Neptune and his sons had intended to come to thank the Straw Hats for this. Neptune revealed that Zoro was already at the palace, and Nami told the others that Franky had gone to look for a relative of [[Tom]] while Robin went to look for a historical item. Upon arriving at [[Ryugu Palace]], Luffy smelled food and wandered away from the others. His scent led him to a tower room with large metal doors; he opened the doors and spotted the food, but ended up stepping on something soft. The lights then turned on as Luffy found himself facing the Mermaid Princess [[Shirahoshi]], who cried out for her father and brothers.{{qref|chap=612|ep=531}} While trying to calm her down, Luffy noticed an axe flying through the door at Shirahoshi and jumped up to intercept it, managing to redirect it into the floor. The [[Minister of the Right]] then led a group into the room to check on Shirahoshi, and she hid Luffy behind her as she lied that she only had a bad dream. The Minister of the Right then revealed that they had canceled the banquet thanking the Straw Hats and would be arresting them instead, as they were suspected of kidnapping mermaids and it was prophesied that they would destroy Fish-Man Island. Once they left, Luffy was unfazed as he believed his crewmates would easily handle the palace guards. Shirahoshi told Luffy that the one responsible for throwing the axe was [[Vander Decken IX]], who wanted to kill her for not marrying him. He possessed [[Mato Mato no Mi|an ability]] allowing anything he threw to reach his target, which was why she had been locked up inside this tower for the last ten years.{{qref|name=c613|chap=613|ep=532}}

[[File:Gomu Gomu no Jet Hammer.png|thumb|left|210px|Luffy pummels Decken into the ground.]]

As Shirahoshi inquired about Luffy's adventures as a pirate, Luffy noted that she was a weak crybaby, which upset her. However, Luffy then offered to take her on a walk outside the palace, saying he would protect her from Decken.{{qref|name=c613}} Shirahoshi was conflicted, but ultimately asked Luffy to take her to the [[Sea Forest]]. Luffy got the idea to sneak her out by stuffing her in Megalo's mouth, and the trio headed out of the tower.{{qref|chap=614|page=11-12, 15-17|ep=533}} As they traveled to the Sea Forest, Shirahoshi told Luffy that she wanted to go to a grave there.{{qref|chap=615|page=16|ep=534}} When they passed over Coral Hill, Luffy saw Sanji and Chopper with an injured Hatchan laying on the ground, and hopped off to check on Hatchan. However, Megalo could not hold Shirahoshi in his mouth any longer and threw her up, leaving the populace in shock.{{qref|chap=617|ep=536}} The citizens tied up Luffy, Sanji, and Chopper while they were distracted, but Vander Decken then came flying toward Shirahoshi. Luffy used Haoshoku Haki to get the citizens out of the way and though tied up, he was able to get to his feet and leap into the air, breaking the coral Decken was riding on with a kick before unleashing a Gear 2 kick called ''Gomu Gomu no Jet Hammer'' that struck Decken and sent him crashing to the ground, defeating him. Shirahoshi untied the Straw Hats before they and Hatchan escaped on Megalo, and Decken summoned Wadatsumi to attack the group. However, Luffy hit Wadatsumi in the tooth with a Gear 2 punch, sending him recoiling in pain and allowing the group to escape.{{qref|chap=618|ep=537}}

The group arrived at the Sea Forest, reuniting with Franky before encountering Jinbe. Shirahoshi went to the grave she wanted to see, which was for her deceased mother [[Otohime]]. Nami and Camie then arrived, revealing that the New Fish-Man Pirates led by [[Hody Jones]] had invaded Ryugu Palace. Jinbe then confessed to the Straw Hats that it was he who had released [[Arlong]] into the [[East Blue]].{{qref|chap=619|ep=538}} He proceeded to explain to them how there were two leaders that recently tried to change the course of a long history of racism and violence between humans and fish-men: Queen Otohime, and the pirate [[Fisher Tiger]], whose crew he and Arlong were a part of.{{qref|chap=620|ep=539}} Tiger had died after being led into a Marine ambush and refusing a blood transfusion from a human. Following this, Jinbe joined the [[Seven Warlords of the Sea]] and arranged for Arlong to be freed from [[Impel Down]], allowing him to break off from the crew and go to the East Blue.{{qref|chap=623|chap2=624|ep=543|ep2=544}} However, Luffy fell asleep and barely heard any of this.{{qref|chap=627|ep=547}}

====Battle for Fish-Man Island====
Hody then broadcast himself all over Fish-Man Island, showing Neptune in chains and saying he would execute the king in three hours at [[Gyoncorde Plaza]]. He then addressed the Straw Hats, showing Zoro, Usopp, and Brook in a cage and saying that they would soon be submerged in water. Following this, Luffy began heading to Ryugu Palace, but Jinbe told him to wait. Jinbe wanted to deal with Hody himself to avoid exacerbating tensions between humans and fish-men, but Luffy did not want to stand by while his crewmates were in danger.{{qref|chap=628|ep=548}} Jinbe began attacking to keep Luffy put, hitting him with a [[Fish-Man Karate]] attack that hurt him despite his rubbery body. Luffy retaliated with a Gear 2 punch, but could only knock Jinbe back a little. Robin then summoned a [[Hana Hana no Mi|clone]] to appear and try to break them up, but Sanji tried to save her and Luffy and Jinbe punched each other as well as him. As they all recovered, the real Robin arrived to calm things down, and Jinbe tried getting Luffy to hear him out but Luffy still remained unconvinced.{{qref|chap=629|ep=549}}

[[File:Straw Hats and Allies Confront the New Fish-Man Pirates.png|thumb|210px|Jinbe and the Straw Hat Pirates face off against the New Fish-Man Pirates at Gyoncorde Plaza.]]

Jinbe said that Luffy could still fight Hody, but needed to to do as a hero rather than an angry human. Luffy had no desire to be a hero, so Jinbe offered him meat instead. Jinbe devised a plan for Luffy to stow away inside Megalo's mouth and have himself and Megalo captured intentionally; he would then call out for Luffy's help after rescuing Neptune, believing that his status among the populace would cause them to support Luffy.{{qref|name=c634|chap=634|ep=554}} Luffy then rode inside Megalo alongside Jinbe and Shirahoshi, but a wrinkle in their plan occurred when Shirahoshi went to a trap that resulted in her being captured along with them. They were brought before Hody to Gyoncorde Plaza, and as Hody announced his plot to execute the Neptune Family, the populace began to grow desperate and plead for Luffy to arrive, even if the pirate would indeed destroy Fish-Man Island. When Hody moved to kill Neptune, Luffy emerged from Megalo's mouth ahead of schedule and kicked Hody with Gear 2, sending him flying back. The rest of the Straw Hats, including Zoro's group, then revealed themselves and prepared to do battle against Hody's crew; an onlooker then asked Luffy if he was a friend or foe of Fish-Man Island, and Luffy said that they should decide that for themselves.{{qref|chap=633|ep=553}}

[[File:Luffy Kicking Hody.png|thumb|left|Luffy strikes Hody.]]

After recovering, Hody boasted against the Straw Hats, saying he would take over the surface world and become Pirate King with his army of 100,000 behind him. He then unleashed this army against the Straw Hats, but Luffy immediately took down 50,000 of them with his Haoshoku Haki. He then told Hody that he would be the Pirate King as he activated Gear 3 and took out even more of the fish-man's forces with a single punch.{{qref|name=c634}} The Straw Hats proceeded to overwhelm Hody's hordes with their new abilities, and Hody ordered Surume, whom he had brought to the region as a slave, to attack. However, Luffy then called out to Surume, instantly causing the kraken to turn against Hody's crew.{{qref|chap=635|ep=556}} Luffy told Surume to protect Shirahoshi, but Hody then threatened the kraken, saying he would kill his brother in the [[North Pole]] if Surume did not obey him. A distressed Surume started crushing Shirahoshi, but Luffy quickly stopped this, saying he would protect Surume's brother. Luffy then walked straight toward Hody, with Zoro attacking anyone who tried to stop him, and kicked the fish-man in the face in a rage.{{qref|chap=636|ep=557}}

Hody quickly recovered from this and tried blowing Luffy's head off with Fish-Man Karate, but Luffy's neck merely stretched back. Luffy then coated his forehead in Busoshoku Haki and broke through iron shields set up to protect Hody, then proceeded to use his Haki to counter Hody's attacks and hit the fish-man with powerful blows. However, the giant ship [[Noah]] then arrived outside Fish-Man Island, and it was discovered that Decken had sent it after Shirahoshi. Shirahoshi proceeded to exit the island's protective bubble and put herself in harm's way to protect everyone, and Luffy told his crew to let him handle this. Jinbe gave him a piece of coral to produce bubbles, and Luffy had Sanji launch him toward Noah.{{qref|chap=637|ep=558}} Luffy grabbed onto one of Noah's chains, and when it exited the barrier and into the ocean, he got in a bubble. Hody swam up to him to capitalize on this advantage, but [[Fukaboshi]] then arrived to carry Luffy to safety. Hody resumed heading toward Noah, where he stabbed Decken to send the ship sinking straight down onto Fish-Man Island.{{qref|chap=638|ep=559}}

Hody then moved to attack Shirahoshi, but Luffy was able to punch him away even with the seawater weakening his outstretched arm. Hody said that Luffy could not protect anyone underwater, but Luffy proclaimed that he had trained for two years to protect everything.{{qref|chap=639|ep=560}} Shirahoshi attempted to redirect Noah's course, but Decken passed out before she could do so, causing Noah to begin its descent.{{qref|chap=640|ep=561}} Luffy decided he would destroy Noah to save Fish-Man Island, but Fukaboshi argued against this as Noah possessed extreme historical importance to his people. Luffy then moved to attack Hody and hit him toward Noah, but suffered a bite wound to the shoulder in the process. Hody deduced that Luffy was heading toward Noah to fight inside its bubble and so used his sword [[Kirisame]] to inflict a large slash that broke the bubble. Fukaboshi then took on Hody, but was defeated.

[[File:Gomu Gomu no Red Hawk.png|thumb|210px|Luffy striking Hody with Gomu Gomu no Red Hawk.]]

In the meantime, however, a group of Ryugu Palace workers were able to extract a large bubble from their air tank and fired it at Noah to let Luffy access it again. Hody then charged at Luffy and Shirahoshi again, but Luffy was able to break Kirisame off his back.{{qref|chap=641|ep=562}} Fukaboshi then made a call to Luffy and the rest of the island via [[Den Den Mushi]], revealing he now knew Hody's true nature. Hody never faced any discrimination or suffering at the hands of humans, but had grown up learning only the hate of those who had. Fukaboshi lamented that his mother's efforts to foster peace had neglected to quell the hatred festering in the populace, and said that the way to move forward was to reduce Fish-Man Island to nothing. However, Luffy reaffirmed his promise to not let anyone on the island be hurt, and prepared a Gear 2 Busoshoku punch which caught fire. Calling it ''Gomu Gomu no Red Hawk'', Luffy struck Hody in the midsection with an explosive punch.{{qref|chap=644|ep=564}}

Luffy had Shirahoshi take him to Noah as Hody got up once again and attempted a last-ditch [[Fish-Man Jujutsu]] attacked, but Luffy dodged the assault and activated Gear 3, hitting Hody with ''Gomu Gomu no Elephant Gun'' and finally defeating the fish-man. Luffy then continued pummeling Noah with Gear 3, intending to destroy the ship.{{qref|chap=645|ep=566}} However, in the midst of his barrage, he heard a mysterious [[Voice of All Things|voice]] telling him to stop. Shirahoshi then intervened and told Luffy to stop, revealing that [[Sea King]]s had arrived and were now holding Noah in place. Luffy relaxed, knowing that everything was now all right, before losing consciousness due to blood loss.{{qref|chap=647|ep=567}}

====The After Battle Party, Huge News, and Departure====
[[File:Jinbe Donates Blood to Luffy.png|thumb|left|210px|Jinbe saves Luffy's life by donating blood.]]

Shirahoshi took Luffy down to Gyoncorde Plaza, begging for help with his bleeding. Chopper said that Luffy would need a transfusion to survive, but the fish-men backed off due to the law. However, Jinbe revealed he had the same blood type and offered to give his blood in spite of the law. The transfusion was successful, and Luffy soon woke up. Once he did, he told Jinbe that the fish-man should join his crew.{{qref|chap=648|ep=568}} The Straw Hats promptly departed on the Sunny, and Jinbe said that he could not join at the moment, but agreed to do so once he had resolved certain outstanding responsibilities of his current position. They then received a call from Neptune inviting them to a proper feast, and headed to Ryugu Palace after picking up Camie and Hatchan, where they ate and danced to their heart's content.{{qref|chap=649|ep=569}}

Jinbe told Luffy about some developments in the world over the past two years, namely that [[Kuzan|Aokiji]] and [[Sakazuki|Akainu]] had battled to become Fleet Admiral, with Akainu emerging victorious and Aokiji leaving the Marines. Despite this loss, the Marines had since grown in strength, along with the [[Blackbeard Pirates]] whose captain [[Marshall D. Teach|Teach]] had taken Whitebeard's spot among the [[Four Emperors]]; the crew was now hunting powerful Devil Fruit users. However, Luffy did not pay attention to all of this. The Straw Hats then heard Shirahoshi crying out, and Luffy arrived at Shell Tower to find Caribou trying to kidnap her. Luffy promptly hit Caribou out of the palace toward the mainland, and the Minister of the Right revealed that Caribou had also stolen the palace's treasure. Wanting the treasure for their crew, Nami sent Luffy, Zoro, and Sanji down to the mainland to get Caribou.{{qref|chap=650|ep=570}}

The trio found Caribou passed out on the ground with heaps of treasure all around him, having been ejected from [[Numa Numa no Mi|his body]]. They collected the treasure and were heading back to the palace when they passed by the Candy Factory, where Luffy proclaimed that he had just eaten a lot of sweets at the palace party. This piqued the interest of [[Pekoms]] and [[Tamago|Baron Tamago]], who had come on behalf of the Big Mom Pirates to collect Fish-Man Island's monthly candy tribute. With the island missing its tribute, Tamago explained that Big Mom's forces would come and destroy it. Big Mom then called Pekoms and Tamago via Den Den Mushi, and while they argued over who should answer, Luffy picked up the call. He introduced himself to Big Mom and claimed to have eaten all the candy tribute; he offered to give her the treasure instead. Big Mom did not believe his claim and did not want the treasure, but was intrigued by Luffy's character and so agreed to place her target on him instead of Fish-Man Island. However, Luffy was just as aggressive, proclaiming that he would defeat Big Mom and make Fish-Man Island his territory. {{qref|chap=651|ep=571}} Following this, he did give the treasure to Pekoms and Tamago.

[[File:Straw Hat Crew Pinky Swears with Shirahoshi.png|thumb|left|210px|Luffy and his crew make a promise with Shirahoshi that they'll return and visit her again.]]

Upon returning to the palace, Luffy told the others what he had done; they were not very pleased, especially Nami due to losing the treasure.{{qref|chap=652|ep=572}} Later, the Straw Hats prepared to depart Fish-Man Island, and Shirahoshi tearfully pleaded for Luffy to stay longer. Nami was given a new Log Pose by the [[Minister of the Left]] which pointed to three islands; upon seeing it, Luffy wanted to go to the island that the shakiest needle was pointing to even though this signified the most dangerous one, causing an argument between him and Nami. Luffy bid farewell to everyone as the Sunny set sail, and Shirahoshi went up to the ship again. She promised that the next time Luffy saw her, she would no longer be a crybaby and they could take a walk up on the surface world. Luffy wrapped his pinky around hers to signify their promise, which the other Straw Hats joined in as well. When the Sunny entered the depths, Luffy stared up, remembering everything he had been told about the New World and how he would meet [[Shanks]] in this sea; he proclaimed his eagerness to get there.{{qref|chap=653|ep=573}}

==Dressrosa Saga==
===Punk Hazard Arc===
====Arriving at Punk Hazard and Forming an Alliance====
As the Sunny made its ascent, Luffy, Zoro, Usopp, and Franky made a fishing line to catch a large deep sea fish to eat. The fish they caught was then eaten by two successive bigger fish, causing the ship to be weighed down and dragged toward a [[Sea Currents#White Strom|White Strom]] current that blasted them away at a dangerous speed. However, the current was broken up by a large pod of [[Animal Species#Island Whale|Island Whales]], and one of them let the Sunny ride on it after hearing Brook play [[Binks' Sake]]. The whales took the Straw Hats to the surface of the New World, leaving them in tumultuous waters.{{qref|chap=654|ep=574}}

The crew soon came across an island with a volcano that was so ablaze even the nearby ocean was on fire. Luffy wanted to disembark there, even though none of the Log Pose's needles were pointing to it. Suddenly, the crew received an emergency call on their [[Den Den Mushi]], and Luffy answered it despite warnings that it was likely a Marine trap. The person on the other end of the line pleaded for help, saying he and his comrades were being attacked by a [[samurai]] on the island, which he called [[Punk Hazard]]. Luffy decided to go and look for the man in distress, and Zoro, Usopp, and Robin were assigned by a draw to accompany him. They rode the [[Mini Merry II]] on a [[Milky Road]] created by Nami's new [[Art of Weather/Sorcery Clima-Tact/Grow Up|Clima-Tact]], and upon landing on the island they found it was sealed off by a fence established by the Marines and World Government, though Zoro cut through it without a second thought.{{qref|name=c655|chap=655|ep=579}}

[[File:Dragon Number Thirteen Anime Infobox.png|thumb|210px|Luffy, Zoro, Usopp, and Robin encounter a dragon.]]

As the group struggled to cope with the intense heat, they noted that the caller mentioned it being cold. They then encountered a [[Dragon Number Thirteen|dragon]] which appeared to be able to talk.{{qref|name=c655}} The dragon started attacking them by breathing fire, and Luffy tried punching it, but did not do much damage against its hard scales. Luffy was able to hurt it by hitting its soft underbelly, but the dragon then began flying. The voice appeared again asking if the Straw Hats were with the [[Seven Warlords of the Sea|Warlord of the Sea]], and Luffy pulled himself onto the dragon's body to knock it out of the sky. While on the dragon's back, he spotted what appeared to be a man stuck inside the top of the dragon's head with his legs sticking out, which was the source of the voice. The dragon moved to attack Luffy with a bite, but Luffy lured it to bite its own wing instead, sending it falling to the ground. Zoro then decapitated the dragon, killing it.{{qref|chap=656|ep=580}}

Luffy then tried to pull the man out of the dragon, but when he did so there was nothing above his waist, causing Luffy to think he killed him. However, the pair of legs then got up and started talking, throwing a kick at Luffy before running off to attack the Warlord in the area.{{qref|chap=656|ep=581}} Luffy apprehended the legs and attached them to his own body, pretending to be a [[Centaurs|centaur]] as his group cooked and ate the dragon's corpse. Zoro then discovered that the other side of the island was covered in ice, meaning the samurai and his victims were likely there.{{qref|chap=657|page=2-5|ep=581}} Despite Robin claiming that centaurs were not real, Luffy then encountered one, who possessed the lower half of a leopard. The centaur became hostile, causing Luffy to defeat him; Robin then defeated his companion, a giraffe centaur. While Luffy was occupied, the group had received a call from Brook revealing that intruders had invaded the Sunny, captured the others, and taken them to the Ice Lands.{{qref|chap=658|page=14-19|ep=582}}

[[File:Boaty Banana.png|thumb|left|210px|Usopp creating a boat using his Pop Greens.]]

The group headed for the Ice Lands and came to a lake at the center of the island. Usopp brought out his [[Pop Green]] ammunition which he used to create a boat out of plant material. As the group rowed across the lake, they were confronted by the leopard centaur, who called out to his boss [[Chadros Higelyges|Brownbeard]] and [[Centaur Patrol Unit|centaur patrol]] that stood on the opposite shore.{{qref|chap=659|page=5-9|ep=583}} Luffy's group recognized Brownbeard as affiliated with the person they were trying to rescue and thought he would be a friend, but Brownbeard had his men fire bazookas at them, capsizing the boat and sending them into the water. Usopp was forced to hold Luffy and Robin above water while Zoro got sidetracked by sharks, leaving them defenseless. However, Brook then arrived to hold off the centaurs, allowing the group to make it across, and they eyed the centaurs' warm coats for themselves.{{qref|chap=661|page=2-11|ep=586}}

After wiping out the centaur patrol, Luffy's group forced Brownbeard to take them through the Ice Lands, and as they rode Luffy heard a crashing sound from far away. They came to the source of the noise near a lab, where they found [[Trafalgar D. Water Law|Trafalgar Law]] who was now a Warlord.{{qref|chap=662|page=10, 19|ep=587}} Luffy was happy to see Law as he was grateful to the Warlord for saving his life in Marineford, but Law brushed it off, saying he acted on a whim and that being pirates meant they may become enemies later. A horde of Marines from [[G-5]] then entered the scene to see to their commanders, Smoker and Tashigi, who had just been defeated by Law. The Straw Hats quickly departed, and Law told Luffy he would find what he was seeking at the back of the lab.{{qref|name=c663|chap=663|ep=588}}

Upon reaching it, the Straw Hats reunited with Nami, Sanji, Chopper, and Franky, though their souls were in the wrong bodies due to [[Ope Ope no Mi|Law's powers]]. The four were accompanied by a group of large children and the head of a samurai, which belonged to the pair of legs. Hiding out inside ruins, the crew went over what they had figured out. The distress call had been sent by one of Brownbeard's centaur subordinates who was being attacked by the samurai, [[Kin'emon]], who was doing so to find his missing son [[Kouzuki Momonosuke|Momonosuke]]. However, Kin'emon was then cut into three pieces by Law's powers.{{qref|name=c663}} The captive Brownbeard then decided to tell the Straw Hats about Punk Hazard, revealing that his master was a man named [[Caesar Clown]] who helped him and people who were formerly test subjects here to walk again after a chemical weapon explosion under the supervision of Dr. [[Vegapunk]]; Law had joined forces with Caesar a few months ago and made them centaurs to fully restore their ability to walk. Brownbeard boasted that the Straw Hats would never escape the island and would become test subjects for his master.{{qref|chap=664|ep=589}} Kin'emon went off to find his torso, and Zoro, Brook, and Sanji (in Nami's body) went out to retrieve him. The giant children then began to shake and ask for candy, but Chopper soon discovered that the candy contained an addictive [[NHC10|substance]] and that Caesar Clown appeared to have been drugging them to make them grow unnaturally large. Upon learning this Luffy refused to get the candy, causing one of the children, [[Sind]], to get violent and hit him with incredible force. Usopp was able to neutralize the children afterwards with a special sleep-inducing shot, and Luffy decided to go and confront Caesar over what he had done to the children.{{qref|chap=665|ep=591}}

Luffy departed with Usopp, Robin, and Franky (in Chopper's body), but they quickly turned around after seeing an explosion back where they had come from. Upon returning to the ruins, they encountered the massive [[Yeti Cool Brothers]] Rock and Scotch, who fired at Luffy with their bazookas. Luffy managed to avoid the blasts, but the brothers suddenly vanished before he could attack them. Chopper (in Sanji's body) then told Luffy's group that the duo had captured Nami (in Franky's body).{{qref|chap=666|ep=592}} Luffy went to go save her, and Franky decided to accompany him, but immediately ate the [[Rumble Ball]]s Chopper had given him causing him to enter Monster Point, resulting in him losing his mind and attacking Luffy. Luffy ran toward Nami with Franky in pursuit until the duo fell into a gorge the brothers set as a trap, where they careened toward a sheet of ice spikes. However, Luffy was able to use Busoshoku Haki to punch through the spikes. Rock then fired bazooka shots at him, but Luffy was able to counter them with ''Gomu Gomu no Fusen'' and use his training to redirect them straight at Rock. Franky continued to go after Luffy as Scotch sent a large mountain peak falling down toward them, but was able to regain his mind just in time to catch the peak and throw it at Rock, defeating him. Luffy then knocked out Franky with ''Gomu Gomu no Elephant Gun'' to neutralize him, but Scotch then took Nami and climbed up the gorge to escape. However, Law then appeared and defeated Scotch, allowing Luffy to break Nami out of her chains.{{qref|name=c667|chap=667|ep=593}}

Law told Luffy he had come to talk with him, saying that this island harbored a key powerful enough to throw the New World into disarray and give one the chance to take power. He offered to form an alliance with Luffy to take down one of the [[Four Emperors]],{{qref|name=c667}} [[Kaidou]]. Luffy agreed, as he aimed to take down all four of the Emperors, even though Law said this plan would have low odds of succeeding.{{qref|name=c697|chap=697|ep=623}} Luffy, Law, Nami, and Franky returned to the hideout in the lab ruins and Law returned Chopper and Franky to their original bodies, placing Nami in Sanji's for the time being. Luffy explained to Law that he and his crew wished to save the children from Caesar's drugging, which Law reluctantly agreed to help with. Law told the Straw Hats that their main objective here was to capture Caesar, and warned them that he was a powerful criminal who had the [[Logia]]-type [[Gasu Gasu no Mi]].{{qref|chap=668|ep=594}}

====Invading Caesar Clown's Laboratory====
[[File:Luffy Grabs Caesar Clown.png|thumb|210px|Luffy grabs Caesar.]]

Luffy launched himself, Franky, and Robin into a Marine battleship at the rear entrance of Caesar's laboratory and loudly proclaimed that he had come to beat and kidnap Caesar.{{qref|chap=669|page=16-17|ep=595}} Luffy was then attacked by Smoker and Tashigi; to his confusion the former was quite weak while the latter was much stronger, but Robin deduced that Law must have switched their bodies as well. Despite Smoker's attempts to fight, Luffy told him they should hold off on it until the vice admiral regained his body. They were then interrupted by large globs of slime falling from the sky; this slime appeared to be alive and moved to combine into a larger mass, and caused a large explosion on another G-5 ship when set alight. Caesar then arrived and started to explain what the slime was, but Luffy immediately moved to grab him.{{qref|chap=670|ep=596}} Though apprehended with Luffy's Haki, Caesar could still use his powers and so forced Luffy to breathe in poison gas; however, it had no effect on the pirate due to the immunity he gained from fighting [[Magellan]]. Luffy then struck Caesar with a kick, but Caesar retaliated by creating an explosion. Caesar then combined his gas with the slime globs to create a much larger explosion, but Luffy was able to dodge this one and kick Caesar in the midsection. However, as he moved to grab Caesar again, the scientist gained the upper hand by removing the oxygen around Luffy, causing him to lose consciousness.{{qref|chap=671|ep=597}}

Caesar quickly defeated Robin, Franky, Smoker, and Tashigi following this and had them and Luffy taken to a cage inside the lab alongside Law, with all Devil Fruit users bound in [[Seastone]]. When everyone regained consciousness, they found themselves with Caesar's comrades [[Vergo]] and [[Monet]]. Law explained that Vergo was a Marine Vice Admiral who was actually undercover in service of "Joker", the codename of the Warlord [[Donquixote Doflamingo]].{{qref|chap=673|ep=599}} Caesar then arrived, revealing he had long known about Law's treachery and using the Warlord's disembodied heart to attack him. He then began a broadcast to the [[Underworld]], announcing that his living slime, [[Smiley]], was made from the chemical weapon that exploded four years ago; he was now about to transform it into an even more powerful weapon known as [[Shinokuni]].{{qref|chap=675|ep=601}} Luffy and the other captives watched as Smiley ate a special candy that transformed it into a gas which petrified in ash anyone it touched. Caesar told his captives that all of their groups would be killed by this gas, including them; he then activated machinery to move their cage outside the lab. However, Law was not worried and told Luffy to stick to his counterattack plan.{{qref|chap=676|ep=602}}

[[File:Punk Hazard Counter Attack Begins.png|thumb|left|210px|The counter attack begins.]]

Law had Franky set a ship below them on fire to shroud the cage in smoke, allowing him to get him and the pirates out of their chains as he revealed he had switched out his Seastone chains with regular ones. Luffy immediately broke out of the cage without bothering to wait for Law, and looked for a way to get into the lab. Law teleported the group inside, and they opened the shutters to allow the G-5 Marines to get in, and they were followed by the rest of the Straw Hats (except Chopper) alongside a fully intact Kin'emon and Brownbeard.{{qref|chap=677|ep=603}} Law told everyone that they had two hours to make it to Section R-66, the only place where it was possible to escape from Shinokuni. Luffy then started racing toward Caesar to resume their battle, and easily beat his henchmen aside with a new attack called ''Gomu Gomu no UFO''.{{qref|chap=678|ep=604}} Luffy continued fighting through Caesar's henchmen as he and Smoker raced into the corridor leading to Section B of the lab.{{qref|chap=679|ep=605}} The duo quickly reached the entrance to Section C where Caesar was, and Luffy immediately punched the scientist upon getting inside.{{qref|chap=680|ep=606}}

[[File:Monet Hugs Luffy.png|thumb|230px|Monet hugging Luffy.]]

Luffy and Caesar resumed fighting, and Luffy was able to avoid the latter's oxygen depletion by moving out of his ability's range. Luffy managed to get behind Caesar and was about to pummel him with a Haki-hardened Gear 2 attack, but the attack was blocked by Monet who created a wall out of snow. Monet told Caesar to flee while she handled Luffy, saying that Doflamingo would eliminate her if she failed.{{qref|chap=681|ep=607}} Monet created a ten-layer igloo of snow around Luffy before hugging him, with her [[Yuki Yuki no Mi|snow Logia]] body quickly depleting his stamina. However, Luffy was able to muster enough energy to escape by breaking through the floor. Though he successfully got out, he ended up falling into the trash heap far below the rest of the lab, with no way to get back up besides flying.{{qref|chap=683|ep=609}} 

[[File:Luffy Meets a Dragon.png|thumb|left|230px|Luffy meets Momonosuke.]]

Luffy soon encountered a small talking pink dragon inside the trash heap who introduced himself as [[Kouzuki Momonosuke|Momonosuke]]. Momonosuke explained that he had been taken to Punk Hazard alongside other kids to be experimented on by Caesar, but he had refused any food offered to him. However, in a fit of hunger he ended up eating a [[Devil Fruit]] locked away in a secret room which turned him into a dragon. Momonosuke told Luffy that he had overheard Caesar talking about how the children in his lab would perish from his tests within five years, causing Luffy to become angry at Caesar and grow determined to climb out of the trash heap. However, Luffy shouted at Momonosuke which caused the young dragon to exclaim in fear and summon clouds that propelled the two of them up and out of the chamber.{{qref|chap=685|ep=611}} After exiting, Luffy ordered one of Caesar's henchmen to tell him where the scientist was, and the henchman immediately responded that he was in Section R.{{qref|chap=688|ep=614}}

====Final Battle with Caesar and Aftermath====
[[File:Luffy Breaks Caesar's Face in the Anime.png|thumb|Luffy breaks Caesar's face by punching him.]]

Luffy broke into Section R as Caesar was attacking Brownbeard, and asked what this place was where Caesar had lied to everyone who served him. Caesar told Luffy that this island was backed by powerful forces, as he produced a substance called [[SAD]] here which Doflamingo used to turn into artificial [[Zoan]]-type Devil Fruits known as [[SMILE]], which was sold to Kaidou to form a massive army of Zoan users. Caesar warned Luffy that attacking him would incite the wrath of the most powerful figures in the New World, but Luffy replied that this had not stopped him before as he struck Caesar in the face.{{qref|chap=689|ep=615}} Caesar continued threatening Luffy with Doflamingo's wrath as he fired an explosive beam, but Luffy dodged it and continued attacking the scientist.{{qref|chap=690|ep=616}}

[[File:Gomu Gomu no Grizzly Magnum.png|thumb|left|220px|Luffy defeating Caesar with a massive attack.]]

Caesar ordered for vents to be opened to send Shinokuni into Section R, and once it did he merged with the gas to make himself big and powerful, not caring about any of his henchmen being caught in it. Luffy started running back toward Section B, but then came running back while stretching his arms behind him, inflating them with Gear 3 and imbuing them with Busoshoku Haki.{{qref|chap=691|ep=617}} Caesar immediately became fearful at what was heading for him and made a last-ditch offer for Luffy to work with him before Luffy launched both enlarged fists into him in an attack called ''Gomu Gomu no Grizzly Magnum''; the attack blasted Caesar all the way out of the lab. Zoro, Nami, Sanji, and Robin then arrived with the children, Tashigi, and G-5 Marines, and Law and Smoker arrived soon after. Law asked where Caesar was, and when Luffy told him what he had done, Law said they needed to go and find him immediately.{{qref|chap=692|ep=617|ep2=618}} The children, Marines, and Caesar's men all gathered into a large SAD cart, and Luffy agreed to move out through the escape corridor once all of his crew was accounted for.{{qref|chap=693|ep=619}}

[[File:Punk Hazard Allies Confront Baby 5 and Buffalo.png|thumb|210px|The Straw Hat Pirates, Kin'emon, Smoker, and the G-5 Marines stand united.]]

As they traveled, an explosion from the SAD room suddenly rocked the corridor and forced Luffy and others to protect the cart from falling rubble,{{qref|chap=694|ep=620}} but they eventually emerged unharmed on the coast. There, they found Franky battling [[Buffalo]] and [[Baby 5]] of [[Donquixote Pirates|Doflamingo's crew]], who had been sent to retrieve Caesar. Upon seeing the arrival of this large force, the duo quickly apprehended Caesar and started flying off. However, Nami and Usopp assured everyone that they could handle this, and quickly neutralized Buffalo and Baby 5 before Usopp trapped Caesar by firing a pair of Seastone handcuffs at him.{{qref|chap=695|ep=621}}

Once Caesar, Buffalo, and Baby 5 were apprehended, the pirates and Marines split up to regroup. Brownbeard and his men were arrested by the Marines; Kin'emon appeared to have been killed by Shinokuni but emerged alive after his petrification shattered, and he and his son Momonosuke reunited; Law rid the kids of Caesar's drugs. Sanji made some food for Kin'emon and Momonosuke to eat, and despite Law saying that they needed to leave at once as more enemies would surely come for them, a large party soon broke out as the pirates and Marines ate and drank together.{{qref|chap=696|ep=622}} Afterwards, the Marines and children departed on the SAD tanker, and thanked the pirates for their help.{{qref|name=c697}}

The Straw Hats, Law, and the samurai then departed Punk Hazard on the Sunny and set sail for [[Dressrosa]], where Doflamingo was based. Luffy and Law got everyone on the crew caught up on their plan to ally and take down Kaidou, and Law explained their next steps. With Caesar captive and his SAD production halted, Doflamingo lost the ability to make SMILE; their goal now was to destroy the Warlord's [[SMILE Factory]] and fully cut off Kaidou's access to artificial Zoan fruits. Kin'emon revealed that he and Momonosuke wished to go to Dressrosa as well, as one of their comrades was being held there.{{qref|chap=698|ep=624}} Night fell with nobody arriving to attack, and the next morning, the pirates found out from the news that Doflamingo had indeed left the Seven Warlords and his throne in order to meet Law's demands to get Caesar back; additionally, the news had learned about Luffy and Law forming an alliance.{{qref|chap=699|ep=628}}

===Dressrosa Arc===
====The Next Objective====
Law contacted Doflamingo to discuss the next part of the negotiation. Luffy suddenly interrupted the call and angrily asked Doflamingo if he is the boss of Caesar. Doflamingo stated his desire to see Luffy and informed the Straw Hat captain that he has something that he would want to get which Luffy thought it was meat. Luffy was then put into a trance until Usopp snapped him out of it. After Law told Doflamingo that he will bring Caesar to Green Bit, he and the Straw Hat planned on how to destroy the SMILE factory on Dressrosa. Luffy then got more excited to see Dressrosa and the crew have a big meal. While eating, Luffy heard Law and Kin'emon talking about a place called Zo. Luffy then listened to Kin'emon and Momonosuke's story about how they were shipwrecked and drifted to Dressrosa as well as how Momonosuke was separated from his father. After hearing about how Kanjuro helped Kin'emon escape, Luffy excitedly declared that they should save him too. The Thousand Sunny soon approached Dressrosa.{{Qref|chap=700|ep=629|Luffy talks with Doflamingo and they soon approach Dressrosa.}}

[[File:Straw Hats In Disguise.png|thumb|left|210px|Luffy and his group incognito.]]

After disembarking, the group began their next phase of their operation. Luffy thought about using Momonosuke, in his dragon form, to fly. However, Momonosuke refused to do so. When Luffy asked him if he is afraid of heights, they got into a small fight until Kin'emon broke them up. The group split into three teams and Luffy went into Dressrosa with Zoro, Sanji, Franky, and Kin'emon to destroy the factory and rescue Kanjuro. While exploring, they saw the things that the country is famous for including living toys. After getting disguises, they stopped at a restaurant to get something to eat. There, they found some thugs taking advantage of a blind man while taking away his money in roulette.{{Qref|chap=701|ep=630}} The man then demonstrated his gravity-like ability when the thugs attacked Luffy for calling their bluff.{{Qref|chap=701|ep=631|page=16-19}}

As the man left, Luffy asked who he was, only for the man to say it was better for both of them if he did not know. After one of Zoro's swords is stolen, he chased after the thief with Sanji and Kin'emon in tow. Luffy attempted to follow them for fun, but was stopped by Franky. Instead, they interrogated one of the thugs, who happened to be a subordinate of Doflamingo, for the location of the SMILEs factory. The thug claimed that he did not know anything about it. He then said that most of Doflamingo's crewmembers were at the colosseum where there was a tournament being held for a big prize. At first, Luffy thought it was meat, thinking back to his conversation with Doflamingo, only for the thug to inform them that the prize was actually Ace's former Devil Fruit.{{Qref|chap=702|ep=631}}

====Corrida Colosseum====
Luffy decided to compete for the fruit, not wanting just anyone to eat it. He offered the fruit to Franky, but he declined, not wanting to lose his ability to swim. Even though the initial objectives were to find the factory and Kanjuro, Franky felt Luffy deserved the chance to fight for the fruit. Luffy and Franky later arrived at Corrida Colosseum where they met a one-legged toy soldier called [[Kyros|Thunder Soldier]].{{Qref|chap=703|ep=632}} While Franky told Luffy that he could go full out in the tournament, it was best to keep his identity secret. He nearly gave himself away when he almost signed his own name, but thanks to Franky stopping him, he ended up signing in as "Lucy". He was then taken to the waiting room, where he met all the contestants. One of them called [[Spartan]] attacked Luffy, thinking he was a weakling. Much to the other contestants' surprise, Luffy easily defeated Spartan.{{Qref|chap=703|ep=633}}

One of the staff members of the colosseum was about to disqualify Luffy. Luckily, Sai and Boo from the [[Chinjao Family]] stepped in and spoke on Luffy's behalf, saying that Spartan was the one who started the fight. After thanking the Chinjao family for saving him from disqualification, Luffy learned that he has been assigned to C Block. Once he was inside the battle preparation room, Luffy got excited seeing all the armor and decided to put some on to make himself look cooler. While learning about the colosseum's weight restriction on protective gear, Luffy was greeted by [[Cavendish]], captain of the [[Beautiful Pirates]].{{Qref|chap=704|ep=633}} Luffy accidentally told him his own name, but the other contestants thought he was mispronouncing his alias "Lucy". Cavendish then proceed to tell Luffy his backstory such as how he came to resent the Eleven Supernovas, but Luffy ignored him during the middle of the conversation. He then sees a bronze statue of a man named [[Kyros]]. While admiring the statue, he met a female gladiator named [[Rebecca]], who told him the story of Kyros. Luffy then sees that Rebecca was determined to win the Mera Mera no Mi to defeat Doflamingo. After Luffy and Rebecca finished their conversation, the winner of A Block was announced and Luffy was shocked to see that it was [[Jesus Burgess]].{{Qref|chap=704|ep=634}}

Before B Block began, Luffy took a look at the warriors defeated by Burgess. He was then approached by Bellamy,{{Qref|chap=706|ep=634}} who told him that he also visited Skypiea. [[Bellamy]] said that his reason for joining the tournament was a chance to join Doflamingo's crew. He went on saying that he has no grudge against Luffy and that he would not laugh at him again.{{Qref|chap=706|ep=635}} Luffy then watched B Block with Cavendish. As the fights in B Block went on, [[Chinjao]] approached Luffy and asked him about Garp, revealing Luffy's identity to Cavendish in the process.{{Qref|chap=707|ep=636}}

[[File:Luffy and Cavendish vs. Chinjao.png|thumb|250px|Luffy and Cavendish fight the furious Chinjao.]]

Luffy kept denying his true identity, but Cavendish drew his sword, preparing to attack Luffy anyway. However, Chinjao made the first move, striking at Luffy with a headbutt. Right after Luffy dodged the attack, Cavendish tried to force Luffy to take off his fake beard. Chinjao then launched another attack, but Cavendish wards off the second headbutt with his sword. Chinjao continuously assaulted both Luffy and Cavendish with his headbutts until Luffy punched him into the ground. When Chinjao became very furious, Boo and Sai came to stop him. While the two managed to calm down Chinjao, Luffy hid himself by hanging from a window sill. Luffy continued to watch the match and witnessed Bartolomeo deflecting [[Hack]]'s attack, which also damaged Hack's hand as well.{{Qref|chap=708|ep=637}}

As he continued to watch the battle in the arena, he was wondering how Bartolomeo was able to damage Hack like that. He then witnessed that even Bellamy could not stand up against Bartolomeo's [[Bari Bari no Mi|strange power]]. He then cheered Bellamy on, urging him to give it his all. After that, [[Elizabello II|King Elizabello]] finally threw his legendary "King Punch" which took out all the remaining gladiators in the arena. Even Luffy said that it was an incredible punch and that he had never seen anything like it. Before the King was declared the winner of B Block's "Battle Royale", Bartolomeo emerged unharmed and revealed that he had eaten the Bari Bari no Mi and had created a barrier to protect himself. He then took out the King and was declared the winner of B Block much to Luffy's surprise.{{Qref|chap=709|ep=638|Luffy is surprised upon seeing Bartolomeo win in the B Block.}}

As an injured Bellamy was moved out of the ring, he and Luffy had another friendly chat and commented on how the other had changed. Meanwhile, Bartolomeo overheard Bellamy calling him Straw Hat.{{Qref|chap=710|ep=639}}

[[File:Luffy Defeats Hajrudin.png|thumb|left|230px|Luffy defeats Hajrudin with a single punch.]]

When C Block started, Luffy entered the ring before Cavendish could confront him. When the gong was heard, Luffy was excited to start fighting.{{Qref|chap=712|ep=641|ep2=642|C Block begins.}} As the battle royale went on, Luffy was seen defeating an opponent effortlessly.{{Qref|chap=713|page=13|ep=643|Sanji sees a Visual Den Den Mushi feed of the colosseum in the plaza.}} Some time during the battle royale, Luffy tamed and befriended the Fighting Bull, naming him Ucy.{{Qref|chap=714|page=13|ep=643}} Luffy rode on top of him as he rampaged around the ring. The bull was eventually stopped and crushed by Hajrudin. Luffy then avenged Ucy by eliminating Hajrudin from the competition with a knock-out punch.{{Qref|chap=714|ep=644}}

Afterwards, Luffy removed Ucy from the fighting area by carrying him over his right shoulder. When he was finished, Luffy entered the fight again only to have his helmet stolen by [[Jean Ango]] who heard a rumor that he was Straw Hat Luffy, forcing him to use his cape to hide his identity.{{Qref|chap=715|ep=645}} Jean Ango then threw multiple weapons at him, which Luffy was able to dodge with ease. The weapons aimed at Luffy hit Chinjao instead. Luffy then took back his helmet before Chinjao knocked the bounty hunter out of the ring. Seeing that Chinjao was hell bent on taking his grudge out on him, Luffy decided to fight him head on. Before clashing with Chinjao, he knocked out Sai while Chinjao knocked out Ideo. As the two remaining fighters in the battle royale, Luffy and Chinjao clashed their fists against each other, causing a large wave of Haoshoku Haki to burst throughout the arena.{{Qref|chap=716|ep=646}}

After Luffy declared his goal of becoming the Pirate King, Chinjao asked him who taught him Haki and Luffy answered that it was Rayleigh. Chinjao then bursts into tears, mentioning about a treasure he was not able to acquire. Luffy told Chinjao to stick to either crying or getting angry and then continued his clash with him.{{Qref|chap=717|ep=647}} After taking some punches from Chinjao,{{Qref|chap=718|ep=648}} Luffy struck back with a powerful attack of his own, hitting him in the chest with his Gomu Gomu no Hawk Rifle.{{Qref|chap=718|page=18-19|ep=649}}

[[File:Luffy Defeats Chinjao.png|thumb|250px|Luffy defeats Chinjao and inadvertently restores his pointed head.]]

After recovering, Chinjao began mocking Luffy, telling him that those known as the Worst Generation are greenhorns who do not know anything of the world and saying that his attempts to surpass Roger are laughable. He then enraged Luffy by saying executing Ace was a smart move by the Marines. Luffy then proceeded to launch himself in the air with Gomu Gomu no Rocket using Chinjao as leverage. He then activated Gear 3 and launched his Gomu Gomu no Thor Elephant Gun while Chinjao took the attack head on with a headbutt. The two collided, seemingly matched up until Luffy managed to gain the upper hand, which coincidentally restored Chinjao's head to the shape it was before his final battle with Garp. Chinjao was then knocked out and fell down to the arena, splitting it in half with his newly reformed head. Chinjao then sank into the water, unconscious, and Luffy officially won C Block. Luffy stood victorious as the audience cheered for him.{{Qref|chap=719|ep=649}}

[[File:Teach Speaks With Luffy.png|thumb|left|230px|Luffy speaks with Blackbeard.]]

After Luffy left the arena, Cavendish thrust his sword at him, but he caught the sword effortlessly and held on to it tightly. Chinjao arrived wanting to thank Luffy for restoring his head but accidentally broke the floor when trying to bow in respect. Luffy ran away from both Cavendish and Chinjao and was saved by Rebecca. He then ran into Burgess, who was communicating with Blackbeard through Den Den Mushi. Luffy declared that he will not allow Ace's power to fall into Blackbeard's hands. At the Gladiator's quarters, Rebecca bought him some food and sat next to him. Some gladiators behind prison bars caught Luffy and after some hesitation, she tried to kill him with her sword. Luffy dodged the attack and pinned her down. Rebecca asked him why he did not seek retribution. Luffy answered that he would not do anything to someone who bought him food. Rebecca then proceeded to tell him about the convict gladiators and how they were imprisoned in the colosseum for opposing Doflamingo. She said that she wanted to win the Mera Mera no Mi in order to be able to protect herself and not have to rely on the Thunder Soldier, who was planning an attack against Doflamingo.{{Qref|chap=720|ep=650}}

Rebecca then explained to Luffy about how the toys are no different from humans, how her mother died and Thunder Soldier was her guardian after her mother's death, which is why he is so important to her. The conversation was interrupted by [[Gatz]] announcing that the ring is repaired and D Block is about to commence. When Rebecca entered the arena, the audience booed and jeered at her. Luffy angrily wondered why and one of the convict gladiators informed him that Rebecca is the previous king's granddaughter.{{Qref|chap=721|ep=651}}

Having also been wrongly judged by Chinjao due to his relation to Garp, Luffy responded by saying that Rebecca has nothing to do with her grandfather, which the convict gladiators agreed. When Cavendish stood up for Rebecca and stopped the audience's booing and jeering, Luffy commented that while he still disliked Cavendish, he was not so bad.{{Qref|chap=722|ep=652}}

As he watched Rebecca's fights during the D Block battle royale, he commented that Rebecca can use [[Kenbunshoku Haki]]. He continued to cheer Rebecca on.{{Qref|chap=725|ep=656}} He later decided to move to a different place to watch the fight. Before leaving, he was told by the convict gladiators about the country's dark side that the public knew nothing about. As he exited the Gladiator's quarters, he encountered Bartolomeo.{{Qref|chap=726|ep=657|ep2=658}}

====Invading the Palace====
Bartolomeo guided Luffy to Zoro and Kin'emon, with the former being annoyed at the fact that he was not invited to fight in the colosseum. He then informs Luffy that the colosseum is surrounded by Marines, who quickly dismisses the fact besides Kin'emon's shock. They then engage in a conference call with Sanji and Franky's group. Everyone is then brought up to speed on the current situation as they learn about the true situation on Dressrosa. When Franky plead to Luffy to allow him to help the dwarves and toys, Luffy quickly gave his permission to assist with the revolution. Just as the call ends, a battle between Law and Doflamingo which raged across Dressrosa abruptly ended right outside the colosseum with Doflamingo standing above his opponent. Luffy cried out to Law in horror as Doflamingo shot him three times at close range.{{Qref|chap=729|ep=661}}

Luffy then angrily yelled at Doflamingo, who responded by saying that it was his duty to discipline Law. Zoro and Kin'emon rushed to save Law. Zoro was intercepted by Issho, the blind man they encountered earlier and Kin'emon was kicked away by Doflamingo before he could retrieve Law. Luffy tried to help his friends, but realized that the bars in the windows of the colosseum are made of Seastone. The entire crew was shocked to be told by Kin'emon that the blind gambler was actually an admiral.{{Qref|name=c730|chap=730|ep=662}}

Both Doflamingo and Issho float above their opponents using their abilities, taking Law with them and head towards the palace. After the Marines started pursuing Zoro and Kin'emon, Zoro told Luffy to find the exit. As Luffy informed the two swordsmen that Law is still alive, they heard that the Sunny is under attack by the Big Mom Pirates, who are after Caesar Clown. During the commotion, Nami told Luffy that Law tried so hard to keep Caesar and Momonosuke away from Doflamingo and cannot allow them to fall into his hands. Luffy gave Sanji's group permission to head for Zo and also allowed Sanji to counterattack against the Big Mom Pirates. While leaving Franky's group in charge of destroying the SMILE factory, Luffy decided to head to the palace with Zoro and Kin'emon to rescue Law and fight Doflamingo.{{Qref|name=c730}}

[[File:Luffy's Reaction to Meeting Sabo.png|thumb|210px|Luffy reacts upon seeing Sabo after twelve years of thinking he was dead.]]

While looking for an exit out of the colosseum, he found Bartolomeo carrying a wounded Bellamy. Luffy said that he was leaving the tournament since rescuing his friend comes first. Bartolomeo proudly declared that he will get the Mera Mera no Mi for him, but someone interrupted them and declared that the fruit could not be given to Luffy. Luffy then talked to this person and recognized him as his older brother [[Sabo]], whom he believed to be dead.{{Qref|chap=731|ep=663}} Luffy began crying in happiness and disbelief and embraced his brother. Sabo was glad that Luffy was alive, and Luffy gave him permission to eat the Mera Mera no Mi at his request.{{Qref|chap=794}} Before leaving, Luffy gave Sabo his gladiator costume so he can take his place in the tournament. Luffy later escaped the colosseum and met up with Zoro and Kin'emon. The trio wore disguises to elude the Marines. As they ran away from the colosseum, Luffy was still crying over the revelation that his brother was alive.{{Qref|chap=731|ep=663}}

Luffy, Zoro, and Kin'emon later arrived at the lift that leads to the royal palace alongside the dwarf, Wicca. There, they encountered Viola, who offered to guide them to the palace.{{Qref|chap=734|ep=666}} After getting acquainted with her and learning about her ties with the Riku Family, Luffy's group was then led to a secret passage. Once inside the passage, Zoro suggested that they use a basket used for lifting supplies and that Luffy should climb up carrying a rock and hang from the chain to act as a counterweight for the basket to move up. Luffy gladly accepted the suggestion.{{Qref|chap=735|ep=667}}

They later arrived at the palace rampart tower. Viola was about to sneak them in, but Luffy went ahead and smashed his way through the gate, much to her chagrin. After Luffy took off his disguise, the group charged in.{{Qref|chap=736|page=11-15|ep=668}} Once Luffy, Zoro, and Viola reached the Rampart Tower B-1, they were intercepted by Pica.{{Qref|chap=736|page=18-19|ep=669}}

After Viola explained about Pica's [[Ishi Ishi no Mi|Devil Fruit ability]], Pica attempted to crush Luffy and his group with the palace walls.{{Qref|chap=737|page=2-3|ep=669}} They managed to avoid it and Zoro held off Pica while Luffy and Viola rushed on ahead, though they were hampered by Pica's power to create dead ends. They eventually ran into Thunder Solder as he was about to be destroyed by Gladius. Luffy knocked away Gladius with a Jet Stamp and caught the toy soldier.

Luffy was about to continue the fight with the officer, but Viola pulled him away, stating that Gladius was too dangerous. Gladius attacked the group, managing to wound Viola which forced Luffy to carry her. Seeing no stairs to advance further up, Luffy jumped out a window and used his leg to stretch to the second floor conveniently outside the Room of Suits. As they overheard Doflamingo trying to get Law to tell him what the Straw Hats' plan was, Luffy asked if he can attack Doflamingo, only to be denied and told to wait by Viola.{{Qref|chap=740|page=2, 8-12, 14-16|ep=672|ep2=673}} They later saw Gladius and his men approaching the second floor. Thunder Soldier also spoke to Luffy about his realization that he and his crew were pirates but also commented that it was reassuring that they share the same goal.{{Qref|chap=742|page=14|ep=676}}

After Thunder Soldier transformed back into a human, Viola revealed to Luffy about Kyros and everything that happened in Dressrosa. After Kyros decapitated Doflamingo, Luffy grabbed Viola and charged in to save Law.{{Qref|chap=743|page=12-16|ep=677}} While rushing to Law, Viola gave Luffy the keys to Law's cuffs. Law told Luffy that their alliance already ended, but Luffy ignored him. His rescue of Law was interrupted by Pica's sudden appearance. Luffy was then surprised to see Doflamingo still alive.{{Qref|chap=744|page=16-19|ep=679}}

It was then revealed that the Doflamingo that was decapitated was only a copy. As Kyros attempted to attack the copy again, the real Doflamingo appeared behind Kyros and attempted to behead him with a kick, slicing the palace in the process. Luffy managed to save Kyros from a fatal blow. Doflamingo and his copy then tried to attack both Luffy and Kyros but they jumped out of the way. Luffy retaliated by using Jet Gatling but Doflamingo blocked the attack. His copy then struck Luffy from behind and he followed by giving Luffy a punch to the face, knocking him back. Pica then threw Luffy, Law, Kyros, Viola, and Riku Dold III out of the palace. They watched as Doflamingo initiated his "bird cage" plan, trapping everyone on Dressrosa.{{Qref|chap=745|page=5-13, 16-19|ep=680}}

====Birdcage====
After Pica relocated the royal palace to the top of the Flower Hill, Doflamingo forced everyone imprisoned into a survival game and put a price on the heads of twelve people. Luffy and his crew were included in Doflamingo's hit list. After reuniting with Zoro, Luffy spoke to Rebecca through Den Den Mushi and informed her that the toy soldier was her father. He told her not to cry and stay close to Usopp, Robin, and Sabo. After declaring that he will defeat Doflamingo and end his game, Luffy grabbed Zoro and Law and pursued Doflamingo.{{Qref|chap=746|page=7-10, 14-19|ep=681|ep2=682}} Luffy jumped down from the King's Plateau and they landed in the middle of a crowd of enemies. After a brief scuffle with Senor Pink, Machvise, and Dellinger, the Dressrosa citizens started attacking Luffy and his group. Luffy was about to use Haki but Issho arrived to confront them. Pica then appeared as a massive stone giant, looking for Doflamingo's enemies. Luffy laughed at his voice, making him angry.{{Qref|chap=747|page=11-17|ep=683|Luffy makes fun of Pica's voice.}}

[[File:Luffy and the Corrida Colosseum Gladiators Going After Doflamingo.png|thumb|left|250px|Luffy, Zoro, Law, and their new allies are on their way for Doflamingo.]]

Pica then threw a punch which sent Luffy, Zoro, and Law flying to the square in front of the colosseum. They were soon approached by Cavendish, who explained that he had ceased his grudge against Luffy. Cavendish offered to defeat Doflamingo for Luffy, but the Straw Hat captain was adamant about defeating Doflamingo himself. They were then joined by those who also wished to fight Doflamingo: the Chinjao Family, Hajrudin, Elizabello II, Dagama, Abdullah, Jeet, Orlumbus, Ideo, Suleiman, and Blue Gilly. After the allied colosseum fighters fought off the former toys who are after Doflamingo's prize money, Luffy was reunited with Ucy. Luffy and his allies then marched towards the royal palace and began to battle against Pica.{{Qref|chap=748|page=4-16|ep=684|The Colosseum fighters join up with Luffy.}}

When Pica attempted to strike Luffy and his allies, Chinjao and Elizabello II shattered Pica's stone hand, enabling Luffy to move forward. Pica then attacked with his other arm, causing Luffy's allies to fall back. However, Luffy, Zoro, Law, Abdullah, Jeet, and Ucy jumped on and climbed on Pica's arm. Pica regrew the arm that was shattered and prepared to attack Luffy again. Luffy responded by shattering Pica's stone head with Grizzly Magnum. Zoro discovered Pica's real body, which appeared in front of Luffy's group. Pica took out his sword and tried to attack the group riding on Ucy, but Luffy carried the bull and evaded the sword strike. Zoro intercepted Pica when he attempted to strike Luffy again. As Ucy ran on the stone giant's back, Law revealed to Luffy that the plan to defeat Kaidou was a trick to get revenge on Doflamingo for killing [[Donquixote Rosinante|Corazon]], a former executive officer of the Donquixote Family, Doflamingo's brother, and Law's benefactor.{{Qref|chap=749|page=2-17|ep=685|ep2=686|Luffy rides on Pica's statue with Ucy.}}

Luffy, Law, Ucy, Abdullah, and Jeet eventually reached the first level of the new King's Plateau. While charging, Luffy repelled the Donquixote Pirates' troops standing in the way.{{Qref|chap=750|page=16-17|ep=687|Luffy reaches the first level of the King's Plateau.}}

After Luffy saw that the other colosseum fighters went ahead of them, Kelly Funk (while fused with Bobby Funk) appeared seemingly to aid them. Law asked Luffy what to do about his seastone handcuffs, but Luffy assured him that things will work out. Kelly then showed them a tunnel that is supposed to go directly to the fourth level. While entering the tunnel, Luffy and Law were shocked to see Abdullah and Jeet fell off. After leaving those two behind, Luffy and Law were contacted by Robin through Den Den Mushi. Robin informed them that she will meet them at the fourth level. Luffy, Law, and Ucy later reached a dead end. While the bull stood on top of a pool of water, a string clone of Doflamingo appeared behind them.{{Qref|chap=751|page=12-17|ep=688|Luffy and Law are trapped by Doflamingo.}}

The clone attacked Ucy with bullet thread, knocking him unconscious. As the bull collapsed, Law and Luffy fell into the water and became powerless. Before the clone could kill them, Abdullah and Jeet struck the clone from behind, destroying it. After recovering, Luffy punched a hole to the second level with Elephant Gun and carried Law with him as he moved ahead of the allied colosseum fighters. Cavendish approached Luffy and told him that he has a plan.{{Qref|chap=752|page=2-11, 16-17|ep=688|ep2=689}}

Luffy and Law then rode on Cavendish's horse. During the fray, Kyros managed to hitch a ride on Farul as well. Luffy was happy to see him while Cavendish was displeased. Kyros was shocked when Luffy informed him that Rebecca was heading for the fourth level. Kyros reminded Luffy that Rebecca is on Doflamingo's hit list, but Luffy assured him that one of his crewmates was with her. When the other colosseum fighters banded together, they created an opening for Luffy, Kyros, and Cavendish to go through.{{Qref|chap=753|page=12-17|ep=690|ep2=691}} As Farul charged towards the third level, Luffy continued to repel any Donquixote Pirates' troops along the way. Luffy, Law, Cavendish, and Kyros then briefly argued over who will be the one to defeat Doflamingo.

Once they reached the third level, they found giant toy soldiers standing in their way.{{Qref|chap=754|page=6-11|ep=691}} One of the toy soldiers bit Farul on the head until Luffy punched it away. With Farul gravely injured, Luffy and his group prepared to battle the toy army. Just then, Robin, Bartolomeo, and Gladius fell from the sky and landed in front of them. Robin and Bartolomeo held back Gladius and the toys to enable Luffy's group to continue towards the fourth level, where Rebecca would be waiting.{{Qref|chap=756|page=12-17|ep=694}} Bartolomeo used his ability to create a stairway to the fourth level. Luffy thanked him, causing Bartolomeo to shed tears of joy. Kyros went ahead while Cavendish decided to remain on the third level to avenge his horse. As Luffy, while carrying Law, ran up towards to the fourth level, Gladius launched rupture bullets at him. Bartolomeo protected Luffy by jumping into the line of fire.

Once Luffy and Law reached the fourth level, Rebecca quickly gave them the key to Law's handcuffs. After removing the handcuffs, Kyros told Luffy and Law to go ahead while he fights Diamante.{{Qref|chap=757|page=2-8, 16-17|ep=695|ep2=696}} Luffy then told Rebecca that he was glad that she could see her father again. Rebecca then asked him if he would really defeat Doflamingo, while still calling him "Lucy". Luffy answered that his name is not Lucy and told her his real name. Diamante tried to stop Luffy and Law, but Law teleported himself and Luffy to the palace pool garden. They were then approached by Sugar, who intended to turn them into toys. Just as she got close to them, Usopp sniped at her from the old King's Plateau and made her lose consciousness, saving both Luffy and Law. With Sugar out of the way, Luffy and Law finally reached Doflamingo.{{Qref|chap=758|ep=696|ep2=697}}

====Confronting Doflamingo====

[[File:Luffy Hits Doflamingo with Red Hawk.png|thumb|210px|Luffy hits Doflamingo with Red Hawk.]]

After seeing at how Doflamingo treated [[Bellamy]] like trash, Luffy was enraged. Law warned him not to let his emotions get the better of him. Luffy attacked Doflamingo with his foot, but he used Bellamy as a shield. Doflamingo then created another string clone to fight Law while controlling Bellamy to fight Luffy. Bellamy begged Luffy to stop him, but Luffy refused as he considered Bellamy a friend. Luffy then aimed an attack at Law. Law activated Room and used Shambles to switch places with Doflamingo, allowing Luffy to strike him with Red Hawk.{{Qref|chap=759|ep=}}

Once Doflamingo recovered from Luffy's attack, he stopped Law from attacking Trebol and incapacitated him with Fulbright. He then struck Luffy with a Haki-imbued kick, tied his hands, and then have Bellamy slashed him. When both Luffy and Law are down, Doflamingo mentioned to them his past as a World Noble.{{Qref|chap=760|ep=}} Doflamingo then sent his string clone and a controlled Bellamy to confront Luffy, and though Luffy attacked them with Octopus Gatling, the Doflamingo string clone got him from behind and slammed him through the floor into the palace interior. The Doflamingo clone spoke to Luffy about the cruelty of man, confusing Luffy.{{Qref|chap=761|ep=}}

Luffy eventually managed to defeat the string clone, sending it flying through the roof with Jet Gatling. He then demanded Doflamingo to release Bellamy. Doflamingo decided to set Bellamy free and Luffy asked him to rest. He was about to go help Law, but Bellamy got up on his feet and continued on with the fight, refusing to betray his own principles and prepared to assault Luffy with his new and improved Spring Hopper.

Luffy yelled at Bellamy for siding with the man who betrayed him and said it wasn't worth fighting, but Bellamy ignored him and drove into Luffy using Spring Hopper, punching him with a Haki-imbued fist and causing Luffy to cough up blood.

[[File:Luffy Defeats Bellamy at Dressrosa Palace.png|thumb|left|210px|Luffy defeats Bellamy with one blow.]]

In spite of Luffy's pleas to not fight, Bellamy refused to back down and Luffy eventually decided to finish their fight, knocking out Bellamy in the same manner as he did at Jaya. Luffy then yelled out Doflamingo's name in anguish.{{Qref|chap=779|page=11-16|ep=720|Luffy defeats Bellamy.}}

Luffy then returned to the palace rooftops and resumed his battle with Doflamingo. As they clashed, Luffy stumbled upon Law's body, which was covered in blood. When Luffy tried to speak to Law, he was unresponsive and Doflamingo stated that he was dead. Luffy refused to believe Doflamingo, who proceed to taunt Luffy by mocking Law's last words, stating he claimed that the Straw Hats could create miracles. Luffy screamed out in rage as Doflamingo prepared to end his game.{{Qref|chap=780|page=9-15|ep=|Luffy fights with Doflamingo and finds Law's unconscious body.}}

Doflamingo then informed Luffy that his Torikago is shrinking and in about one hour, it will destroy everything in Dressrosa. Luffy declared that he will stop it by defeating Doflamingo. As Luffy charged at his opponent, Law suddenly appeared in front of the latter and used Gamma Knife to damage Doflamingo's internal organs. Doflamingo grabbed onto Law's face, but Luffy kicked him away with Jet Stamp. As Doflamingo lied injured at Law's feet, Trebol attempted to attack Law only to be kicked away by Luffy. Law used Counter Shock on Doflamingo and collapsed from exhaustion. However, Doflamingo stood back up, revealing that he can use his string powers to fix his internal injuries. Doflamingo attempted to stomp on Law's head, but Luffy quickly intervened.{{Qref|chap=781|page=3-19|ep=|Luffy and Law continue fighting Doflamingo, with Law getting defeated.}}

Doflamingo and Luffy battled intensely using [[Haki/Busoshoku Haki|Busoshoku]] and [[Haki/Haoshoku Haki|Haoshoku Haki]]. Though Luffy's first attacks were blocked, he managed to exploit an opening and punch Doflamingo repeatedly, ending with Gomu Gomu no Eagle Bazooka. However, Doflamingo evaded the Eagle Bazooka and kicked Luffy using Athlete's Thread, sending Luffy crashing into the ground, right into Trebol's trap. Trebol held Luffy down so that Doflamingo could finish off Law once and for all. Luffy got mad at the executive and attempted to hit him with a Busoshoku Haki-imbued fist. However, the attack had no effect, despite Luffy thinking Trebol was a Logia. Law then told Luffy to stop attacking Trebol, and Trebol left a trapped Luffy to go to Law. Luffy witnessed Law wounding Trebol and was caught in the explosion Trebol created.{{Qref|chap=782|page=2-19|ep=|The fight with Doflamingo and Trebol continues, with Trebol getting wounded by Law.}}

[[File:Luffy Saves Law from Trebol's Explosion.png|thumb|210px|Luffy saves Law from Trebol's explosion.]]

However, Luffy managed to escape the explosion and carried Law with him. Luffy then threw Law down towards Robin and her group on the Flower Field, telling them to help Law. Not willing to let Law get away, Doflamingo shot at Robin with Tamaito, despite Luffy kicking him with Gomu Gomu no Hawk Whip. However, Doflamingo's bullet was deflected by Cavendish. Luffy then told him to take Law and the others out of the Flower Field. Cavendish initially refused, but Luffy told him that he entrusted their lives to him, making Cavendish think that Luffy was his fan. Luffy then resumed his battle against Doflamingo, and hit the Shichibukai with Busoshoku Haki-imbued fists, sending him flying off the roof. However, Doflamingo laughed it off, saying that Luffy's attacks were quick but lacked power. He then attacked Luffy with Overheat, sending Luffy flying. Doflamingo mentioned to Luffy how he had followed the young pirate's career before kicking Luffy into the palace wall, causing a large chunk of it to fall away. However, Luffy quickly got back up and continued fighting, attacking with Gomu Gomu no Grizzly Magnum. Doflamingo easily avoided his attack and exploited the opening it left, kicking Luffy into the ground. Doflamingo then taunted Luffy about the shrinking Torikago and how it would kill all his friends, all because the Straw Hats stepped foot on Dressrosa. Luffy became enraged at Doflamingo for hurting his friends and prepared to activate [[Gomu Gomu no Mi/Gear 4 Techniques|Gear 4]].{{Qref|chap=783|page=2-19|ep=|Luffy ensures Law's safety and activates Gear 4.}}

[[File:Gear 4 Infobox.png|thumb|left|250px|Luffy using Gear 4]]

Luffy activated Busoshoku Haki in his left arm and blew into it, inflating the muscles and exponentially increasing his arm's size. He continued blowing until Boundman was activated. In this form, Luffy's entire torso became massive and he could only bounce, not stand. Doflamingo mocked his form, but Luffy revealed that he had subdued beasts with this form. Luffy then sunk his arm into his body and hit Doflamingo with Gomu Gomu no Kong Gun, which sent Doflamingo flying far away into the streets. Luffy then sunk his legs into his body and flew toward Doflamingo. With precision, Luffy speedily maneuvered behind Doflamingo and dropkicked the Shichibukai using Gomu Gomu no Rhino Schneider, sending Doflamingo crashing through several buildings. An enraged Doflamingo then flew up to the sky and Luffy rose to meet him, attacking Doflamingo with Gomu Gomu no Culverin Cannon. However, Doflamingo managed to avoid the attack and kicked Luffy with Athlete. However, Luffy's rubber managed to absorb the blunt attack despite being covered in Busoshoku Haki, and Luffy shook Doflamingo off. Luffy then used Culverin Cannon again, but this time he changed its direction several times to follow Doflamingo, and eventually succeeded in punching Doflamingo in the face.{{Qref|chap=784|ep=|page=6-19|Luffy overwhelms Doflamingo with Gear 4.}}

Luffy then flew toward Doflamingo, knowing that Gear 4 was about to end. He attacked Doflamingo with both fists, but Doflamingo countered by summoning strings from the ground. Doflamingo revealed his Devil Fruit awakening powers to Luffy, shocking the Straw Hat, who wondered if Doflamingo was even a Paramecia anymore.{{Qref|chap=785|ep=|page=2-8|Luffy encounters Doflamingo's Awakened abilities.}}

Twenty minutes later, Luffy continued battling against Doflamingo's strings as he listened to Riku's speech to the citizens of Dressrosa. Doflamingo turned much of the town into string to attack Luffy, but Luffy evaded the string, pulling his head and arms into his body as he attacked Doflamingo with Gomu Gomu no Leo Bazooka, sending the Shichibukai crashing into the palace mountain.{{Qref|chap=785|ep=|page=16-19|Luffy seemingly defeats Doflamingo.}}

Luffy noticed that the Torikago remained active, meaning that Doflamingo was not utterly defeated. Luffy quickly flew to the palace mountain and attempted to finish Doflamingo off. However, before he could reach him, his Gear 4 wore off and he was completely exhausted. Gatz arrived and helped Luffy up and revealed that all the gladiators from the colosseum were there to aid Luffy. Luffy asked Gatz to give him 10 minutes to recover and Gatz proceeded to take Luffy to safety. They were then attacked by Burgess but were saved when Sabo kicked Burgess away.{{Qref|chap=786|ep=|page=2-17|Luffy is forced out of Gear 4 and is protected from Burgess by Sabo.}}

[[File:Luffy Intercepts Rebecca's Attack.png|thumb|210px|Luffy intercepts Rebecca's unwilling attack.]]

With Sabo holding Burgess back, Luffy assured him that he will defeat Doflamingo once his Haki recharges. Sabo then entrusted Gatz to Luffy's safety.{{Qref|chap=787}} As Gatz ran away with Luffy, Law suddenly used Room to teleport to their location. With three minutes left for Luffy to recharge, Law took over protecting him. Luffy then lay on the ground near Law as his Haki regenerated.{{Qref|chap=788}} Eventually, Luffy's Haki fully recharged, and with the help of Law and his Shambles, Luffy prevented Rebecca from being forced to cut down Viola and confronted Doflamingo once more.{{Qref|chap=789|ep=|page=18-19|Luffy intercepts Rebecca's attack and confronts Doflamingo again.}}

Doflamingo attacked both Luffy and Rebecca with his strings, but Law saved Rebecca, so he turned his attention solely to Luffy. Doflamingo then turned an entire portion of the town into string to attack Luffy with a thousand "Flap Thread" string arrows.

Doflamingo immobilized Luffy and taunted him by saying that all the slaughter could have been avoided had the people of Dressrosa just accepted their manipulation. This enraged Luffy to the point where he instantly reactivated Gear 4 and broke the strings holding him, taking the remainder of the fight into the skies above.

[[File:Luffy Defeats Doflamingo With Gomu Gomu no King Kong Gun.png|thumb|left|200px|Luffy finishes off Doflamingo with King Kong Gun.]]

After once again saying Luffy stood no chance against him due to his "commoner's blood", Doflamingo attempted to trap him in his Spider's Net. As Luffy enlarged his right arm and readied his final attack, Doflamingo unleashed 16 Godthreads in a last ditch effort to kill Luffy. Despite this, Luffy's King Kong Gun broke through and slammed him into the ground, destroying several buildings and shattering his trademark sunglasses.{{Qref|chap=790}}

This time, Luffy's attack successfully defeated Doflamingo and the Torikago collapsed. While still in mid-air, Luffy deflated and started falling. Law saved him by instantly teleporting him to the ground. Having passed out from injury and exhaustion, Luffy's head was placed onto Rebecca's lap as the latter began to cry in happiness.{{Qref|chap=791}}

====After Doflamingo's Defeat====

[[File:Fighters Resting at Kyros's House.png|thumb|210px|Luffy and his crewmates rest at Kyros' house.]]

After Doflamingo's downfall, Luffy and his group went to the palace, but later went to Kyros' old house to rest and recover.{{Qref|chap=794}} Three days after Doflamingo's defeat, Luffy continued his recovery as he heard about the rumor about Rebecca's father. He was not pleased with the rumor even after Kyros explained that he started it. Bartolomeo then entered the house, revealing that the Marines were mobilized to pursue the Straw Hats. He also explained that he and the other gladiators planned an escape route for them. Luffy then ran out of the house with the others, but suddenly stayed behind, saying that he still had something left to do.{{Qref|chap=796}}

Zoro then told Luffy to hurry with his business and they will be waiting for him at the eastern port. Luffy then dashed to the royal palace and called out Rebecca. Once Luffy found Rebecca, he asked her if she was okay with Kyros leaving her. Rebecca answered "no" and Luffy offered to take her to him. Luffy then took Rebecca and made his way to the hill where Kyros' house is located. After dropping off Rebecca there, Luffy ran towards the eastern port.{{Qref|chap=797}}

Luffy reached the eastern port just when Issho was about to attack his allies with the all the rubble from Dressrosa. Luffy then attacked the Admiral with a Haki-imbued Gear 3 attack, pushing him back. Luffy declared that he grew tired of running away from an Admiral and prepared for a fight.{{Qref|chap=798}}

[[File:Luffy Punches Issho.png|thumb|left|210px|Luffy punches Fujitora.]]

As they clashed, Luffy announced every single one of his attacks and where he was aiming before striking. Fujitora wondered if Luffy was taking pity on him due to his blindness. Luffy declared that he would not attack without saying anything, given that his opponent was blind. Fujitora laughed, explaining that they were supposed to be sworn enemies and no one is supposed to fight an admiral like that. Annoyed and slightly angered, Fujitora blew Luffy with his gravity ability. Hajrudin caught Luffy and the Straw Hats, Law, and Luffy's other allies quickly fled across a bridge leading to a gigantic ship in the distance. As Fujitora prepared to bombard the all the nearby ships with floating rubble, the citizens of Dressrosa arrived to "chase" after the pirates. Not wishing to harm the citizens, Fujitora halted his attack, allowing his targets to get away.

Luffy and his allies eventually reached Orlumbus' flagship, the Yonta Maria. After boarding the ship, the following pledged their allegiance to Luffy: Cavendish of the Beautiful Pirates (including Suleiman), Bartolomeo of the Barto Club, Sai of the Happo Navy, Ideo of the XXX Gym Martial Arts Alliance (including Blue Gilly, Abdullah, and Jeet), Leo of the Tontatta Tribe, Hajrudin of the Giant Warrior Pirates, and Orlumbus of the Yonta Maria Grand Fleet.{{Qref|chap=799}}

[[File:Straw Hat Grand Fleet Celebrates.png|thumb|210px|The newly-formed Straw Hat Grand Fleet celebrates their victory over the Donquixote Family.]]

When Luffy was asked to drink a sake cup to complete the agreement for an alliance, Luffy declined, much to the others' shock. He did not wish to become someone great and powerful, but someone who is free, as well as not take away the freedom from his fellow allies. Once Luffy explained that they can do whatever they want, the allies decided to forge the alliance anyway, forming the Straw Hat fleet. To Luffy's surprise, Sai, Bartolomeo, Leo, Cavendish, Ideo, Orlumbus, and Hajrudin sat down and drank their sake cups, and Zoro ended up drinking the rest of the sake in what was supposed to be Luffy's cup. Afterwards, they held a feast to celebrate their victory over Doflamingo. As the group left Dressrosa, a multitude of pirates who had suffered great blows to their business ventures because of Doflamingo's defeat came after the Yonta Maria Grand Fleet, seeking to bring down Luffy. However, Fujitora dropped the rubble from Dressrosa on the enemy ships as a final thanks to Luffy for what he had done in the kingdom, while Kyros and Rebecca watched from afar and officially began their new life as a family together.{{Qref|name=c800}}

After the feast, each of the leading allies received Luffy's vivre card and parted ways. Bartolomeo then brought the Straw Hats, the samurais, and Law to his ship, the Going Luffy-senpai. After Zoro noticed the Straw Hats' increase in bounty from a newspaper, Bartolomeo proudly showed Luffy's group their new wanted posters.{{Qref|chap=801}}

===Zou Arc===
====Encounter with the Mink Tribe====
During a hail storm, Luffy learned that the Barto Club does not have a [[navigator]], lack experience in sailing, and they usually called a granny who gives them useless advice. Therefore, Luffy, the other Straw Hats, the samurais, and Law needed to protect the ship. After one week of traversing through the dangers of the New World, the ship finally arrived at [[Zou]]. Luffy was astonished to see that Zou is an island on the back of giant elephant that is over 1000 years old.{{Qref|chap=802|page=3-5, 12-17|ep=747|ep2=751|Luffy, his crew, and his allies make their way to Zou.}}

After finding the Thousand Sunny, the Barto Club bid Luffy's group farewell. Proceeding to search for Sanji's group, they climbed the giant elephant's left hind leg with a dragon that Kanjuro conjured. After the samurais explained that they were also searching for their ninja comrade, [[Raizo]], Luffy and the others saw something dropping towards them.{{Qref|chap=803|page=2-5, 12-13|ep=752|Luffy, his crew, and his allies begin ascending the elephant's leg.}}

[[File:Luffy Surveys Mokomo Dukedom.png|thumb|left|210px|Luffy surveys the Mokomo Dukedom.]]

The thing that was falling towards them happened to be a monkey. The monkey hit Kin'emon and Kanjuro, causing them to off the dragon. Despite being separated from the group, the samurais assured the Straw Hats that they were alright and will catch up to them eventually. The rest of Luffy's group considered turning back for them, but after they saw the dragon struggling to climb, they decided to continue towards the top. Once they reached the top, the dragon turned back into a drawing and the group went on to explore the island. They discovered a village and Luffy ran ahead of the group, searching for Sanji, Nami, Brook, and Chopper.{{Qref|chap=804|ep=753}}

<div style="float: right">[[File:Luffy Fights Roddy.png|thumb|210px|Luffy clashes with Roddy.]]</div>

Luffy later went to the Whale Forest and got attacked by a bull mink called [[Roddy]] for trespassing. They clashed until [[Wanda]] and [[Carrot]] arrived and stopped them. After [[Pedro]] called off the guardians, Luffy got reacquainted with the [[Heart Pirates]] and explained that Law was on the island as well. Wanda then explained to Luffy about a recent attack on Zou before offering to take him to Sanji's group, much to his excitement.{{Qref|chap=805|ep=754}}

While riding Wany, Wanda told Luffy about the climate on Zou and how the sea water from [[Zunesha]]'s eruption rain is filtered and sent across the country via a system of aqueducts. She and Carrot also explained that that rain also drops plenty of fish, providing them with a good food source. As they travel, they went past some wooden stockades used for torturing prisoners. Luffy asked her about the pirate she mentioned earlier, and she told him about Jack, explaining that his obituary was in the paper, since he was believed to be killed during a raid on a Marine escort. She added that his death wasn't confirmed, so he might still be alive. Right after Law teleported the rest of Luffy's friends close to their location, Wanda led them into Right Belly Forest. Luffy was overjoyed to be reunited with Nami and Chopper. Nami embraced Luffy as she told him what happened to Sanji.{{Qref|chap=806|ep=755}}

[[File:Rightflank Fortress.png|thumb|left|210px|Luffy and the Straw Hats arrive at Right Belly Fortress.]]

While having a feast with the Mink Tribe, Luffy told Zoro not to be rude to the minks. He was then happy to see Brook again. Brook explained that Momonosuke was safe but refused to leave his room. He also warned Luffy not to mention samurai or the Wano Country. Before he could explain the reason, he was interrupted by canine minks. After Luffy told Chopper that Law was with his crew, Nami asked him what to do about Sanji. Since Sanji had left a letter, Luffy was not too worried, much to Nami's chagrin. Luffy then listened to Nami and Chopper's story about how they escaped the Big Mom Pirates before listening to Wanda's story about how Nami's group saved the Mink Tribe. After hearing that Prince Inuarashi awakened from his coma and wanted to meet Zou's benefactors, Luffy and his group went to meet him. On the way, Wanda began to explain to them about Jack's attack on Zou in more detail.{{Qref|chap=807|ep=756}}

During her explanation, Wanda revealed that Jack was searching for a Wano ninja known as Raizo. After Wanda finished with her recollection, Brook explained to his crew the reason why they should not mention samurai or the Wano Country. When Luffy blurted out the ninja's name, Nami, Usopp, and Brook swiftly beat him up. They then arrived at the duke's home where they were introduced to Sicilian, who expressed his gratitude to the crew. After entering the duke's home, they heard about a weapon Jack used against the Mink Tribe.{{Qref|chap=808|ep=757|ep2=760}}

<div style="float: right">[[File:Audience with Inuarashi.png|thumb|210px|Luffy and the Straw Hats meet Inuarashi.]]</div>

After hearing that the weapon was made by Caesar, Luffy became angry. Inuarashi then changed the topic of their conversation to how he once met Shanks. Luffy was about to talk more about him, but the duke suddenly fell asleep since dusk arrived.{{Qref|chap=809|ep=758|ep2=760}}

After Wanda finished recalling the devastation caused by Jack and the Mink Tribe's salvation, Luffy promised to make Jack and Kaidou pay one day. Wanda expressed her doubt about Jack being dead, as she saw how powerful he was and how he fought. The Straw Hats then decided to visit Nekomamushi and the Guardians and they traveled to the Whale Forest with Wanda and Carrot. On the way, Nami and Brook began to explain to the rest of the group what happened when Big Mom's ship arrived at Zou two days before Luffy's group's arrival.{{Qref|chap=811|ep=761|ep2=762}} Specifically, they informed the rest of the crew of Big Mom's upcoming [[Tea Party]], which would host a political wedding between Sanji, the third son of the [[Vinsmoke Family]], and the 35th daughter of the [[Charlotte Family]], [[Charlotte Pudding|Pudding]]. They also explained that Sanji, after ensuring the safety of Nami, Brook and Chopper, chose to leave with the Big Mom Pirates in order to settle things with his family.{{Qref|chap=812|chap2=813|ep=763|ep2=764}}

[[File:Journey to Nekomamushi.png|thumb|left|210px|The Straw Hats go off to see Nekomamushi.]]

After hearing about the circumstances surrounding Sanji's departure, Luffy was initially excited at the prospect of having another crewmate. However, when Brook told him that they would become subordinate members of Big Mom's hierarchy if Sanji married her daughter, Luffy became displeased at the idea. Despite this, when Chopper explained the possibility of Sanji severing ties with them in order to avoid this exact scenario, Luffy became worried that Sanji might quit the Straw Hats, which he considered even worse than sailing under Big Mom. Luffy then decided to find Sanji, although his crew objected to confronting Big Mom without a plan. After arriving at the Whale Forest, Pedro then brought Luffy to Pekoms. When Luffy questioned him about the arranged marriage, Pekoms revealed that Sanji's father and Big Mom arranged the wedding to finalize an alliance between their families, and that the Vinsmoke Family is a family of killers.{{Qref|chap=814|ep=764|ep3=765}}

[[File:Luffy Throttles Pekoms.png|thumb|210px|Luffy visits Pekoms and gets angry when the mink says Sanji will likely not return.]]

Pekoms proceeded to tell them about a mysterious organization known as [[Germa 66]], commanded by the Vinsmokes and headed ultimately by Sanji's father. Luffy then stated that he did not care and told Pekoms that he wanted the Big Mom Pirates to be his underlings, not the other way around. Shocked and furious at this statement, Pekoms reminded Luffy of Big Mom's power and status. Once he calmed down, Pekoms explained the reason why Sanji could not refuse the invitation—if he did, he would receive the decapitated head of someone close to him. Luffy then asked him how the Big Mom Pirates knew so much about Sanji and Pekoms replied that it was because of the power that all [[Four Emperors]] hold. Pekoms went on to say that the marriage, instead of making the Straw Hats Big Mom's subordinates, would automatically result in Sanji leaving the Straw Hats and joining the Big Mom Pirates—a revelation to which Luffy did not take kindly. Pekoms said that he will return to the Big Mom Pirates once he recovered; Luffy then told Pekoms to also take him to the tea party to find Sanji, ignoring Pekoms' objections.

As he ran outside, he found Zoro listening in on the earlier conversation. Luffy assumed that Zoro was also worried about Sanji, much to Zoro's annoyance. They then met Nekomamushi, who then gave them a warm greeting. Law arrived and his introduced his crew to Luffy. Law was then shocked to be informed that Sanji went to Big Mom. Luffy said that he will bring Sanji back and told him not to attack Kaidou until he returns. Law then explained that Kaidou might be pursuing them as they speak and Zou could be at risk. After the minks felt touched by Law's concerns, Nekomamushi decided to party with Luffy and his group.{{Qref|chap=815|ep=765|ep2=766}}

====Revelations and a New Alliance====

[[File:Raizo Is Safe.png|thumb|left|210px|Inuarashi and Nekomamushi reveal that Raizo is safe.]]

The next morning, Luffy and his group heard a bell ringing and realized that Kin'emon and Kanjuro had arrived. They quickly rushed to find them, fearing what would happen if the Mink Tribe meets the samurai. The Straw Hats managed to intercept Kin'emon, Kanjuro, and Momonosuke just as they arrived at Kurau City and tried desperately to keep them hidden. However, as Nekomamushi and Inuarashi were fighting, Kin'emon and Kanjuro revealed themselves. Contrary to what the Straw Hats expected, the Mink Tribe welcomed the samurais and revealed that Raizo is safe. The Straw Hats were stunned to learn that the minks knew about Raizo all along and went to great lengths to keep him hidden despite the abuse they suffered.{{Qref|chap=816|ep=767}}

After Momonosuke stopped Inuarashi and Nekomamushi from continuing their quarrel, Kin'emon revealed that Momonosuke was not his son but was actually the son of [[Kouzuki Oden]], which surprised Luffy as Momonosuke and Kin'emon looked alike. However, Luffy still did not took Momonosuke seriously. Inuarashi and Nekomamushi then took the Straw Hats, Law, and the samurais to Raizo, and Luffy and the other male pirates were excited to meet him, thinking he would be like a stereotypical ninja. When they met Raizo at a secret room inside the whale-shaped tree, Luffy and his crewmates were shocked by Raizo's appearance, but still begged him to perform various tricks. Raizo refused until the pirates started sulking, which caused him to use some of his ninja arts, and the pirates were immediately entranced.{{Qref|chap=817|ep=768|ep2=769}}

Luffy, Usopp, and Chopper then accompanied Kin'emon, Kanjuro, and Raizo as they stood outside the Whale Tree, expressing their sorrows as they saw the state Zou was in after Jack's attack. When Robin deciphered the red [[Poneglyph]] hidden in the Whale Tree, Nekomamushi called them back in. Inuarashi then explained to the Straw Hats about the four Road Poneglyphs and they listened in anticipation as he revealed how they can lead to Laugh Tale. When Nekomamushi revealed that Kaidou and Big Mom each possessed one Road Poneglyph, Luffy became more eager to fight them. Usopp was delighted to hear that they can copy the information on the Poneglyphs using gyotaku, but Luffy was not interested in that approach, much to Usopp's chagrin. The Straw Hats were then surprised when Nekomamushi revealed that Momonosuke's ancestors created the Poneglyphs. However, the samurai explained that Momonosuke never inherited the knowledge of the Poneglyphs due to the execution of Lord Oden at the hands of Kaidou and the shogun of Wano. The Straw Hats also learned that Oden was part of Roger's crew and had been on Laugh Tale with him as well as the Beasts Pirates' objective in obtaining the secret that Oden knew.{{Qref|chap=818|ep=769|ep2=780}}

The samurai explained Oden's will to open Wano Country to the world and they went on a journey to gather allies in order to fight Kaidou and the shogun of Wano. Kin'emon then requests Luffy's assistance, but Luffy declined, saying that Momonosuke should make the request himself. Momonosuke then declared his will to fight Kaidou and protect those dear to him. He bowed and humbly asked for Luffy's help. Seeing Momonosuke's resolve, Luffy accepted the request and formed an alliance with the samurai and the Mink Tribe.{{Qref|chap=819|ep=770|ep2=772}}

[[File:Luffy and Momonosuke Hear Zunesha.png|thumb|210px|Luffy and Momonosuke hear Zunesha's voice.]]

Right after leaving the secret room, Luffy learned that Inuarashi and Nekomamushi traveled with Oden and had been on the ships of both Whitebeard and Roger. He also learned that the remnants of the Whitebeard Pirates were defeated and then forced into hiding by the Blackbeard Pirates one year after the Summit War of Marineford. The alliance decided to split up to accomplish different tasks and meet up again at Wano. Nami, Chopper, and Brook chose to accompany Luffy in his mission to rescue Sanji. Robin asked Luffy to make a copy of the Poneglyph in Big Mom's possession. However, before they could start their operation, they felt Zou shaking and heard Zunesha crying.{{Qref|chap=820|ep=772|ep2=773}}

As everything shook around them, Luffy heard Zunesha's voice. However, Luffy's own voice cannot reach it. After Momonosuke revealed that he can hear the elephant's voice as well, Luffy urged him to give the elephant a command, which was to drive Jack away. After Jack's fleet has been sunk, Luffy prepared to disembark Zou.{{Qref|chap=821|ep=773|ep2=774}}

[[File:Sanji Retrieval Team Heads Out.png|thumb|left|210px|Luffy and the Sanji Retrieval Team prepare to depart Zou.]]

He then went to check up on Pekoms and was shocked to see that the house he was resting in collapsed. He was relieved when Pekoms revealed that he used his Devil Fruit powers to save himself from further injury. Luffy then carried Pekoms on his back and departed from Zou with the Sanji Retrieval Team (which also included Pedro). Everyone, except the Straw Hat members left behind, were shocked when Luffy jumped off Zunesha with his party.{{Qref|chap=822|ep=776}}{{-}}

====Journey to Whole Cake Island====

[[File:Carrot Joins Sanji Retrieval Team.png|thumb|210px|Carrot convinces Luffy to let her join their team.]]

As they sailed towards [[Whole Cake Island]] on the [[Thousand Sunny]], Luffy scolded [[Nami]], [[Tony Tony Chopper|Chopper]], and [[Brook]] for acting less energetic. Nami pointed out that they were still recovering from the shock of Luffy's stunt at [[Zou]]. The group on the Sunny were then surprised to see [[Carrot]] had snuck aboard the ship. After she begged them not to turn back, Luffy allowed her to come along. When the crew got hungry, Luffy, in Sanji's absence, insisted on preparing a meal himself after Nami was going to charge them money for the food.{{Qref|chap=823}}

While cooking, Luffy and the rest of the Sanji retrieval team learned from a newspaper about the [[Blackbeard Pirates]]' attack on the Revolutionary Army's headquarters on [[Baltigo]]. Luffy was shocked to see what his [[Monkey D. Dragon|father]] looks like and also worried for [[Sabo]]'s life. [[Pedro]] assured Luffy that if the revolutionaries were defeated, it would have been mentioned in the newspaper. Luffy then realized that he forgot to turn off the stove, causing a fire. After passing through a storm, Luffy presented his dish, which his group did not enjoy in the least. Luffy then admitted that he used up all the food they had and his group found themselves in a food shortage crisis.{{Qref|chap=824}}

===Whole Cake Island Arc===
====Entering Totto Land====

[[File:Luffy Gets Fish Poisoned.png|thumb|left|210px|Luffy gets severe poisoning after eating a fish's skin.]]

A few days later, the group was famished from the lack of food and overheated as they passed through boiling waters. They were saved from starvation when Luffy managed to catch a gigantic fish. Luffy immediately started eating the fish and consumed the fish's toxic skin, which led to Luffy being incapacitated by food poisoning. After they entered Big Mom's waters, the group on the Sunny was approached by a ship belonging to [[Germa 66]].{{Qref|chap=825}}

The Straw Hats were approached by two of Sanji's siblings, [[Vinsmoke Yonji]] and [[Vinsmoke Reiju]]. Reiju proceeded to suck the poison out of Luffy through his mouth, causing him to be revived almost instantly. Luffy thanked Reiju for saving him, as Reiju explained that the [[Vinsmoke Family]] had been searching for Sanji since he left them as a child. Luffy wanted Reiju to give Sanji back to the crew, but Reiju leaped back onto her ship, and she and Yonji sailed away.{{Qref|chap=826}}

[[File:Luffy and Chopper Eat a Cafe.png|thumb|210px|Luffy and Chopper eat an entire café at Cacao Island.]]

The group later docked at [[Cacao Island]], an island close to Whole Cake Island. After seeing buildings made of chocolate, Luffy and Chopper went ahead to explore the island. When they ate a café, a policeman confronted them and was about to arrest them. The owner of the café, [[Charlotte Pudding]], arrived and came to their defense, saying that they were hired to dismantle the café. After she saved Luffy and Chopper, the team accompanied her to her home where she offered them food. While conversing with her, Luffy accidentally revealed his name.{{Qref|chap=827}}

The Sanji retrieval team was then shocked to learn that the woman they were conversing with was Sanji's betrothed, who in turn, was surprised to discover that the group was from the Straw Hat crew. After calming down, Luffy and the team listened as Pudding explained more about the Charlotte Family and her thoughts about Sanji. Luffy and the others was shocked to hear that Sanji turned her down. Pudding then showed them a secret route to Whole Cake Island and told them where to meet her while promising to bring Sanji to them. The Sanji retrieval team then left in a hurry when guards arrived for Pudding and quickly returned to the Thousand Sunny. Pekoms was nowhere to be seen and they found a message telling them to turn back. Luffy decided to continue forward, saying that things got interesting.{{Qref|chap=828}}

[[File:Sanji Retrieval Team Battles a Centipede.png|thumb|left|210px|The Sanji retrieval team battles a giant centipede.]]

After leaving Cacao Island, Luffy wanted to go rescue Pekoms, but Pedro dissuaded him, saying that the mink would be all right. The team sailed on Pudding's route and reached the next [[Jam Island|island]], but Nami decided to stay away from it. Luffy quickly steered the ship starboard, causing the helm to burst into flames, much to Nami's chagrin. Luffy later wanted to go into the kitchen to cook again, but Nami quickly stopped him. A giant aquatic centipede then attacked the Thousand Sunny, and the team began battling it.{{Qref|chap=829}}

The team later battled a swarm of giant ants before getting trapped in a frozen sea of syrup as night fell. As they worked to unfreeze the sea, Pedro revealed that the giant ants had once eaten his own ship, and Luffy wondered what he did there in the past. Pedro then explained that he once traveled with Pekoms as a pirate and came to Totto Land searching for Poneglyphs, revealing that his journey met with defeat. However, Pedro was fine with coming back to help the Straw Hats. He told Luffy that since Inuarashi and Nekomamushi showed him the Road Poneglyph on Zou, they must believe that he can follow in [[Gol D. Roger]]'s footsteps, as he was the only other stranger to see it, and so they needed to acquire Big Mom's Road Poneglyph. He then offered to sneak in and steal it while the others rescue Sanji. Luffy agreed to this proposal as the ants returned. The next day, the team reached Whole Cake Island.{{Qref|chap=830|page=11-17|ep=790}}

====The Perils of the Seducing Woods====

[[File:Luffy Meets His Reflection.png|thumb|210px|Luffy confronts his physical reflection.]]

After docking at the southwestern coast of Whole Cake Island, the team split into two groups, with Pedro and Brook departing to find Big Mom's Road Poneglyph. Right after Luffy's group disembarked on the island, Luffy saw what appeared to be Sanji in the nearby forest. Luffy, Chopper, and Carrot ran after him with Nami following them, but he somehow disappeared. Luffy, Chopper, and Carrot entered the woods to continue searching, although they were often distracted by the sweet environment. The team was nearly eaten by a talking crocodile, and Nami attempted to get everyone to turn back, but Luffy intently pressed on the search for Sanji. They also encountered a man with a gigantic head whose body is buried into the ground. Suddenly, Luffy encountered Big Mom's 8th daughter, [[Brûlée]], who was disguised as another version of himself and talked and acted simultaneously with him just like [[Mira Mira no Mi|a mirror reflection]]. The two got angry at each other and started fighting, matching each other's blows exactly, and they told the others to go ahead and look for Sanji.{{Qref|chap=831}}

Nami, Chopper, and Carrot returned to where Luffy was still fighting Brûlée as they were being chased by [[Randolph]]. Brûlée went with them while Luffy ran in the opposite direction. Luffy attempted to tell them that the real him was not with them, but Brûlée stifled him before he could say anything.{{Qref|chap=832}}

As night fell over Whole Cake Island, Luffy gathered multiple, bound fake versions of Sanji, Pudding, Nami, Chopper and Carrot into the center of a clearing in the Seducing Woods. Luffy exclaimed that he found all of them, but that they were all acting strangely. He then asked whose idea it was to begin multiplying.{{Qref|chap=834}} Luffy then discovered the real Nami among the fakes and quickly untied her. Luffy realized they did not multiply on purpose as she berated his logic and explained to Luffy about what happened during the encounter with Brûlée. While interrogating a buried man named [[Pound]], they learned about a toll that the citizens of Totto Land must pay to Big Mom as well as the Emperor's Devil Fruit power, which enables her to give life to many things. The man then revealed that he was one of Big Mom's husbands, who was discarded after having two daughters. Big Mom's tenth son, [[Charlotte Cracker]], appeared and confronted the group.{{Qref|chap=835}}

[[File:Luffy Fights Cracker.png|thumb|left|210px|Luffy saves Pound from Cracker.]]

As Luffy and Nami confronted Cracker, they were suddenly ambushed by [[Randolph]] again, but Cracker knocked him over in anger. Luffy and Nami watched as Cracker argued with Brûlée and the guards of the Seducing Woods. Brûlée showed a captured Carrot and Chopper trapped in her mirror before shattering the mirror into pieces. Luffy was worried but Chopper revealed that he and Carrot remained unharmed. When Cracker tried to kill Pound, Luffy blocked his sword. He then kicked Cracker's arm, forcing him to free Pound. Luffy battled Cracker, but was sent flying into a tree homie, and he got up and prepared to give his all against Cracker.{{Qref|chap=836}}

Nami asked to Luffy to retreat, but he refused and tried to attack Cracker with Elephant Gun. After blocking the attack, Cracker easily overwhelmed Luffy with his swordsmanship, Devil Fruit abilities, and Busoshoku Haki, sending Luffy flying through several tree homies despite Luffy using Haki himself. Luffy returned and attacked Cracker with Hawk Gatling, but Cracker countered it with his Haki-imbued shields, which Luffy stated were harder than any Busoshoku Haki he had faced before. Cracker slammed Luffy into the ground and drew closer to him, berating Luffy for wanting to take Sanji away from a royal lifestyle. Luffy grew angry at Cracker for claiming that Sanji would tell him and the other Straw Hats that he never wanted to see them again. Luffy then activated Gear 4 and managed to send Cracker flying with Kong Gun.{{Qref|chap=837}}

While Cracker was on the ground, Luffy used another Kong Gun and shattered Cracker's biscuit armor. The real Cracker emerged from it, cutting Luffy's right arm with Pretzel. Cracker revealed his true Devil Fruit abilities to Luffy as he created multiple biscuit soldiers, which Luffy attacked. However, Cracker had them advance as he leaped out from behind them to attack Luffy, barely missing his head.{{Qref|chap=838}}

[[File:Luffy Defeats Cracker.png|thumb|210px|Luffy defeats Cracker.]]

The battle lasted for eleven hours, and Luffy adopted a strategy of fighting, running, and eating Cracker's biscuit soldiers. This made Cracker increasingly exasperated, and Luffy was determined to chip away Cracker's stamina and go to Sanji.{{Qref|chap=841}}

Cracker soon produced more biscuit soldiers and sent them charging at Luffy. Nami used Rain Spark and softened the soldiers, which Luffy then devoured. As Luffy was reaching his limit, he used another variation form of Gear 4 called Tankman: Full Version. When Cracker tried to pierce Luffy with his sword, Luffy sucked Cracker into his body and sent him flying into Sweet City.{{Qref|chap=842}}{{-}}

====Sanji's Rejection and Big Mom's Retaliation====

[[File:Luffy Refusing to Fight Back Against Sanji.png|thumb|left|200px|Luffy refusing to fight Sanji.]]

After Cracker's defeat, Luffy laid on the ground, exhausted from the battle. He then rested on top of King Baum's head alongside Nami as they traveled to Big Mom's castle. On the way, Luffy returned to his normal size and they encountered the Vinsmoke carriage and saw Sanji again. Excited, Luffy leaped onto the carriage and asked Sanji to return with him. In response, Sanji kicked Luffy off the carriage and told him to leave. Luffy refused to listen, so Sanji volunteered to handle Luffy himself.{{Qref|chap=843}} As Sanji approached Luffy, he further insulted the latter before kicking him in the face. Luffy withstood the attack and remained on his feet. Sanji continued the confrontation by repeatedly kicking Luffy until he finally collapsed (and lost a tooth). After Sanji returned to his family's carriage, Luffy got back on his feet and yelled to Sanji, saying that he knew that Sanji never meant what he said. Luffy declared that he would wait for Sanji and would gladly starve to death if he does not return. Luffy went on saying that he would not eat any food unless it is made by Sanji's hands.{{Qref|chap=844}}

[[File:Big Mom's Army Defeats Luffy.png|thumb|210px|Luffy is defeated by Counter and Cadenza.]]

After the Vinsmoke Family left, Luffy and Nami soon saw the weather changing into a massive storm as an army marched towards their location. Luffy refused to run and hide, so he fought the army head on.{{Qref|chap=845}} As the battle raged on, Luffy managed to defeat most of the army before he was overwhelmed by [[Charlotte Opera]]'s cream, which scalded his skin, and he raced to attack Opera. However, [[Charlotte Mont-d'Or]] put Luffy into the setting of one of his books, preventing Luffy from seeing the real world. This prevented Luffy from seeing two Big Mom Pirates members, [[Charlotte Counter]] and [[Charlotte Cadenza]], from rushing at him, and he was punched from the front and the back with Cream Punch, sending him crashing down. The Big Mom Pirates headed back to Sweet City, and one of them tried to carry Luffy. Luffy tried holding onto the ground in order to stay at his spot, but Counter stomped on his head.{{Qref|chap=846}}

[[File:Luffy and Nami Are Held Captive.png|thumb|left|210px|Luffy and Nami held captive by Big Mom.]]

Luffy and Nami were then imprisoned inside a book. Inside the prisoner library, Big Mom spoke to them through a Den Den Mushi. Luffy shouted at her to let him go. Big Mom laughed at his liveliness and said that she thought he had broken his promise to battle her due to not bringing his entire crew. Luffy replied that he still intended to fulfill that promise, but he was only there to get Sanji back, though he would still fight her if she showed up. Big Mom replied by telling Luffy that he was nothing compared to her and that she could have him killed without even needing to show up. Big Mom said that if they gave up on rescuing Sanji, she would free them once the wedding was complete and warned them that if they interfered with her plans, she would give them hell. Big Mom recalled the time Luffy gave her treasure including the legendary box known as the Tamatebako and explained that she had taken a liking to the box that she would forgive the Fish-Man Island incident altogether and planned to open the Tamatebako during the wedding ceremony. Luffy shouted at her to be quiet, saying the wedding would not happen and asked to speak to his friend, Pudding. Big Mom laughed incredulously about the Straw Hats being friends with the bride-to-be and then inquired about Lola. Big Mom recounted on how Lola running away from an important political marriage ruined her plans to become Pirate King. Luffy replied that Lola did not need to be a pawn in Big Mom's rise to power and challenged the Emperor again, saying he would get Sanji back and defeat her in the end.{{Qref|chap=847}}

Sometime after the conversation, Pudding came to the Prisoner Library and requested to talk to Luffy and Nami, and she entered their cell via an opening created by a bookmark. Pudding apologized for the harm her siblings had inflicted on them, and apologized for not meeting them on the coast like they agreed. She revealed that Sanji had proposed to her, but stated that she knew he did not truly want to marry her and so she would not marry him. She then whispered to Luffy and Nami, saying with a sinister expression that she would kill Sanji during the wedding ceremony and that Luffy and Nami would not leave alive. Pudding then left their cell with tears while telling them goodbye and insulting them.{{Qref|chap=848}}

[[File:Luffy Races Through Whole Cake Chateau.png|thumb|210px|Luffy chokes Counter while racing throughout the Whole Cake Chateau to get to Sanji.]]

Shocked and angry at what Pudding said, Luffy then struggled to break free, determined not to die, even if it meant tearing off his arms.{{Qref|chap=850}} Before Luffy could further injure himself, Jinbe arrived at the Prisoner Library and took down Opera with a single punch. Luffy and Nami were overjoyed as Jinbe prepared to free them.{{Qref|chap=851}} Jinbe then released Luffy and Nami by burning the book they were imprisoned in. Luffy then collapsed from hunger but quickly got back up as Big Mom's soldiers were charging into the Prisoner Library. Luffy dashed out of the Prisoner Library and went on a rampage throughout the castle, searching for Sanji. During the rampage, Luffy strangled Counter while demanding Sanji's whereabouts.{{Qref|chap=852}}

Luffy continued to run through the hallways, calling for Sanji, until Reiju grabbed him and hid him in the infirmary. Reiju then informed him that Sanji was already aware of Pudding's deception. She also mentioned that she tried to convince Sanji to leave, but he was worried about the chefs at the Baratie and the Straw Hats. Relieved that Sanji was not being deceived, Luffy jumped out of the castle and headed back to the place where he promised to wait for Sanji.{{Qref|chap=853}} Dazed and fatigued, Luffy began his journey through Sweet City in the rain.{{Qref|chap=854}} He later made it back to the promised place, where he fell asleep while he waited patiently for Sanji.{{Qref|chap=855}}

[[File:Luffy Punches Sanji.png|thumb|left|210px|Luffy punches Sanji to stop him from lying about his obstacles to rejoining the crew.]]

Luffy woke up when he smelled the bento box Sanji was carrying. Sanji gave the box to him and Luffy happily ate the food. When Luffy once again asked Sanji to leave with him, Sanji explained his reasons why he could not. Luffy responded by punching Sanji and demanded him to tell the truth. Sanji broke down in tears, saying that he wanted to return to the crew but did not want to leave his family to die. Luffy then gave Sanji his support, saying that they would ruin the wedding together.{{Qref|chap=856}}

Luffy and Sanji were later contacted by Chopper's group through a mirror shard. After Luffy explained his intent to ruin the wedding ceremony, Jinbe explained to Luffy more about Bege, such as his backstory and him plotting against Big Mom. Jinbe proposed to Luffy about forming an alliance with Bege, and Luffy agreed to meet him.{{Qref|chap=857}}

====The Wedding====

[[File:Straw Hat Pirates Meet Fire Tank Pirates.png|thumb|210px|The Sanji Retrieval Team meets with the Fire Tank Pirates.]]

Once at Bege's hideout, Luffy and Sanji were greeted by Vito, who asked them to take a bath since his boss does not like to meet with dirty people. After Luffy and Brook had their bath, they raided Bege's fridge for milk (with Luffy regaining his lost tooth and Brook's cracked skull healing). Luffy and his team soon met Bege and the negotiations were hectic with Luffy spotting Caesar Clown among Bege's crew and wanting to attack Bege for hurting Pekoms. The brawl was broken up when Jinbe pointed out that the group share a common enemy in Big Mom. Reluctantly, Luffy asked Bege about his plan and the latter responded that he already had a perfect one prepared.{{Qref|chap=858}}

Bege proceeded to explain the details, including informing Luffy that he would be the bait to distract Big Mom's subordinates once Bege triggers one of her tantrums. Despite Nami's and [[Charlotte Chiffon|Chiffon]]'s protests, Luffy agreed excitedly, stating that he already had a plan for how to make his entrance at the ceremony. Luffy, Bege, and Caesar then agreed that their alliance would come to an end once Big Mom was dead and all groups had made their escape. As the meeting adjourned, Luffy asked Bege for a favor.{{Qref|chap=||chapter = 859|text = The new alliance concludes its discussions on the plot to assassinate Big Mom.}} Luffy requested Bege to place a mirror inside the wedding cake so he could enter the venue from there, taking everyone by surprise. Planning to take advantage of Brûlée's power, Luffy rounded up a bunch of animals from the Seducing Woods and had her turn them into Luffy duplicates.{{Qref|chap=863}}

[[File:Luffy and Duplicates Emerge from Wedding Cake.png|thumb|left|210px|Luffy and his animal duplicates burst out of the wedding cake.]]

Bege took the alliance members to the tea party in his castle, and Luffy slept for the first time in three days.{{Qref|chap=861}} After the wedding ceremony began, Jinbe had difficulty waking Luffy up but eventually managed to do so with food. The team then prepared to charge into the venue once they heard the signal. Right after Katakuri's attempted assassination on Sanji failed, multiple duplicates of Luffy emerged from the wedding cake.{{Qref|chap=862}}

As chaos erupted at the wedding venue, Luffy identified himself when Big Mom called out to him. Luffy attempted to attack the photo of Carmel, but his attempt was thwarted by Katakuri, who immobilized Luffy with his Devil Fruit power. Jinbe came to Luffy's aid and freed him using black tea. When Jinbe officially declared to Big Mom that he was leaving the Big Mom Pirates and joining the Straw Hats, Luffy was worried that Big Mom would take away Jinbe's lifespan. However, Luffy was delighted to see that Big Mom's power had no effect on him due to having no fear towards Big Mom and cheered when he toasted a cup of sake to signify his departure from her.{{Qref|chap=863}}

[[File:Luffy Shows the Broken Portrait.png|thumb|210px|Luffy shows Big Mom the broken portrait of Mother Carmel.]]

Big Mom then tried to attack Luffy and Jinbe with Prometheus, but the two evaded the attack. Luffy was then overjoyed to see Brook destroying the picture of Carmel. However, Big Mom did not start screaming after three seconds like they planned. During the ensuing conflict, Bege pretended to pin Luffy down to avoid suspicion. When Brook was decapitated, his head rolled towards them, but he still survived. Brook then whispered to Luffy that Big Mom was in a state of confusion on what to be mad about and their best chance was to show her the broken photo of Carmel again. Bege questioned if there is any point with the plan, but when they were approached by Katakuri, Bege noticed that he foresaw a horrific future and became confident again that the plan will work out. While Bege confronted Katakuri, Luffy grabbed Carmel's broken portrait, preparing to show it to Big Mom.{{Qref|chap=864}} Katakuri then went after Luffy and pinned him down with his Devil Fruit powers. However, Luffy was still able to stretch his arms and showed Carmel's broken portrait to Big Mom, causing her to start her strange scream. Luffy then shielded his ears from Big Mom's voice.{{Qref|chap=865}}

After putting on earplugs, Luffy watched as Bege, Vito, and Gotti fired their KX Launchers at Big Mom. However, Big Mom's scream detonated the rockets before they could reach her, shocking Luffy and his allies. With the assassination attempt a failure, Caesar flew into the venue with the escape mirror and Bege signaled Luffy to retreat. Before they could [[Mirro-World|escape into the mirror]], Big Mom's scream shattered it, leaving them trapped in the venue. Luffy then watched in amazement as Bege transformed into a giant fortress.{{Qref|chap=868}}

Luffy then marveled at the fortress as he and his group fled to it. After all the alliance members and the Vinsmoke Family successfully retreated inside, Bege went on to explain to his allies about the dire situation they were in. Luffy then showed concern when Bege bled as his fortress sustained damage from Big Mom's attacks.{{Qref|chap=869}} He tried rushing out to attack Big Mom, but was held back by his crew. They were intent on not fighting Big Mom, and Bege hatched an escape plan. The Vinsmoke Family went out to cover for the alliance, but when Reiju was overwhelmed, Luffy and Sanji went out and blocked Big Mom's attack, with Luffy doing so against Sanji's orders.{{Qref|chap=870}}

[[File:Big Mom Blocks Gear 4.png|thumb|left|210px|Luffy clashes with Big Mom.]]

As Sanji dragged Luffy away, Big Mom taunted Luffy by using his previous threats to her before calling him spineless. In response, Luffy activated Gear 4 and tried to strike Big Mom, who easily blocked his attack. Before falling back, Luffy told Big Mom that he would be coming after her after Kaidou is defeated. Before they could escape, Luffy, Sanji, and the Vinsmoke Family were subdued by the Charlotte Family. Big Mom was going to execute them, but the Tamatebako dropped to the base of the Whole Cake Chateau and exploded, causing the castle to topple over.{{Qref|chap=871}}{{-}}

====Fleeing From Big Mom====

[[File:Big Mom Attacks Straw Hat Group.png|thumb|210px|Big Mom attacks the Straw Hats as they try to escape.]]

As the castle collapsed, Luffy's group, Bege's crew, and the Vinsmoke Family got away. The Sanji Retrieval Team and the Fire Tank Pirates rendezvous at the northwest part of Whole Cake Island, where Luffy and Bege agreed to go their separate ways.{{Qref|chap=872}} After Brook and Chopper separated from the group to retrieve the Shark Submerge, the rest head for the Thousand Sunny. As they approached the Seducing Woods, Luffy was surprised to see King Baum alive and stitched back together. Nami then revealed that she still possessed part of Big Mom's Vivre Card and used it to control King Baum again, forcing him to transport the fleeing team. However, before they reached the Seducing Woods, a crazed Big Mom (while riding on Zeus) caught up to them.{{Qref|chap=873}}

[[File:Luffy Attacks Prometheus.png|thumb|left|210px|Luffy unsuccessfully attacks Prometheus.]]

Using Napoleon in its sword form, Big Mom unleashed an air slash that cut off a part of King Baum. Luffy noted that the attack was similar to Dorry and Brogy's combination attack. As Big Mom prepared to attack again, Luffy prepared to fight, but Nami interrupted him and diverted Zeus' attention by using thunderclouds, causing the cloud homie to veer off-course and drop Big Mom. When Luffy and his group reached the Seducing Woods, Big Mom ordered the tree homies to stop the Straw Hats, but King Baum charged through them. Luffy and his group were later forced to jump off King Baum when Prometheus attacked and burned King Baum for his betrayal.{{Qref|chap=874}} As the Sanji Retrieval Team continued with their escape, Jinbe explained about Big Mom's eating disorder to Luffy as she resumed her pursuit. Prometheus caught up to them and Luffy attacked the fire homie to avenge King Baum, but he was unable to harm the living flames with Haki punches. After Jinbe stunned Prometheus with blasts of water, several Big Mom Pirates caught up to their captain and clashed with the Sanji Retrieval Team. Along the way, Luffy stopped Carrot from separating from the group. The team pulled out of the conflict quickly, knowing they could not split up there. When Zeus ate one of Nami's weather eggs and grew massively and became stormy, Nami took the opportunity to summon a massive lightning bolt that struck the Big Mom Pirates pursuing them.{{Qref|chap=875}}

Nami's attack left Big Mom laying at the bottom of a crater. To the Straw Hats' shock, Big Mom was barely affected and continued to move. She ate through the ground as she moved back up, and the team started running again. They were then approached by Pudding and Chiffon. Luffy was angry to see Pudding again as she tried to tell Sanji about their mission to make a cake. To Luffy's confusion, her mood swings as she went from being in love with Sanji to wanting to kill him and back. Chiffon took the lead as she petitioned for Sanji to help them make a cake to satiate Big Mom's eating disorder, and Sanji readily agreed to assist them. Big Mom then got back on her feet and unleashed another devastating air slash, and the two groups parted ways with Sanji heading to Cacao Island with Pudding and Chiffon while Luffy and his group continued fleeing to the Thousand Sunny. Pudding used her Devil Fruit powers to send memories flooding into the souls in the homies, allowing the Straw Hats to make it to the coast without trouble.{{Qref|chap=876}}

[[File:Luffy vs. Katakuri.png|thumb|210px|Luffy clashes with Katakuri to get the Sunny back.]]

The Sanji Retrieval Team made it back to the ship, but they got into a conflict with Perospero and Katakuri, who were onboard. Luffy was also surprised to find Chopper and Brook trapped in candy. Perospero sent a spiked candy iron maiden at the Straw Hats, but Luffy destroyed it with a Red Hawk. Upon reaching the ship, Luffy clashed against Katakuri. After Perospero trapped the ship in candy, Luffy watched in shock as Pedro attempted to take out Perospero with a massive suicidal explosion.{{Qref|chap=877}}

As the team completed preparations for their getaway, Katakuri once again made his move and subdued Carrot when she tried to attack him. Luffy then grabbed Katakuri and dragged him into the Mirro-World. Once there, Luffy smashed the mirror to the Sunny and prepared to continue his fight with the Sweet Commander.{{Qref|chap=878}}

====A Fierce Clash====

[[File:Katakuri vs. Luffy Elephant Gun.png|thumb|left|210px|Luffy and Katakuri clash inside the Mirro-World.]]

With the Sunny fleeing from Big Mom and her fleet, Luffy and Katakuri commenced their fight, with Katakuri claiming that he had outmatched Luffy in both speed and power. After Luffy attacked with Hawk Gatling, Katakuri countered with several mochi tendrils hardened into fists, before proceeding to warn Luffy that anything Luffy can do, he could do better. Luffy then asserted that rubber would never lose to mochi, but his subsequent Hawk Stamp was dodged and Katakuri kicked him into a wall. Luffy then tried using Elephant Gun, but Katakuri created an even larger fist with mochi and pushed Luffy into the wall with tremendous power, overwhelming Luffy.{{Qref|chap=879}}

With Luffy lying on the floor, Katakuri then ordered Brûlée to find another mirror on the Sunny and use the portal to set the Sunny on fire. After [[Charlotte Joscarpone|Joscarpone]] and [[Charlotte Mascarpone|Mascarpone]] arrived with a mirror, Luffy rushed towards them, but Katakuri stopped him and reminded him of his promise to fight one-on-one. Katakuri then resumed attacking Luffy, warning him not to lay a hand on his younger brothers and sisters. Luffy successfully dodged the attacks and made contact with Nami through a mirror shard, ordering her to break all the mirrors on the Sunny so that he can focus solely on fighting Katakuri.{{Qref|chap=880|ep=}}

Luffy showed concern for his group when he heard that Big Mom sunk the Thousand Sunny. While the Big Mom Pirates were puzzled by the mirrors leading to the Sunny breaking one by one, Luffy was contacted by his team after they survived Big Mom's assault. As Luffy distanced himself from the nearby Big Mom Pirates, his group told him to find a mirror connecting to Cacao Island so they could meet him there. Luffy was then further assaulted by Katakuri and Luffy covered his mouth to prevent his team from knowing that he was sustaining injuries. In a brief moment, Luffy told his team to hurry on to Cacao Island. As Katakuri prepared to kill him, Luffy declared that he did not plan on dying.{{Qref|chap=881}}

As Luffy continued to struggle against Katakuri, Brûlée started bragging about Katakuri's legendary strength. Luffy then tried to punch her, but Katakuri grabbed his fist and slammed him into a wall. After pondering on how he should maim Luffy, Katakuri then began to attack with his trident Mogura. In the midst of this, Katakuri noted on how Luffy dodged his strikes more so than anyone and revealed his awakened powers to trap the Straw Hat captain. As Luffy was restrained, he prepared to resort to using Gear 4.{{Qref|chap=882}}

[[File:Luffy Sees Katakuri Eating.png|thumb|210px|Luffy intrudes on Katakuri's snack time.]]

Before Luffy could activate his Gear 4, Katakuri prevented him from activating it by engulfing him with mochi. Growing tired of their battle making his snack time late, Katakuri turned much of the surrounding Mirro-World into mochi and piled it onto Luffy in order to suffocate him. While Katakuri was feasting on some snacks, Luffy escaped by eating through the mochi and located Katakuri inside a nearby mochi house using his Kenbunshoku Haki. He then broke into his house and saw Katakuri in the state of eating. This made Katakuri furious, and he quickly dispatched his chefs before attacking Luffy, overwhelming him with strong Busoshoku Haki. However, Luffy managed to land a kick on Katakuri's jaw, and Katakuri was incredulous when Luffy stated he had figured out his weakness. Luffy then activated Gear 4 and struck Katakuri with Kong Gun, which Katakuri blocked.{{Qref|chap=883}} Luffy gained the upper hand against Katakuri, landing several Gear 4 attacks on him. However, once Katakuri regained his composure, he resumed dodging Luffy's attacks and landed a powerful strike on Luffy, knocking him back.{{Qref|chap=884}}

With Luffy losing the advantage, Katakuri went on the offensive. When Katakuri mentioned that Luffy would deflate, Luffy realized that his Gear 4 would wear out soon and retreated. His Gear 4 wore out as he was fleeing with Katakuri chasing after him. Once he came across Brûlée, he grabbed her and escaped the Mirro-World before Katakuri could catch him. Luffy and Brûlée then arrived at Nuts Island and found Big Mom rampaging there. After he was spotted by Big Mom, Luffy ran away while still carrying Brûlée. Perospero blocked Luffy's path with a Candy Wall and Luffy tried to destroy it with a Gigant Pistol, which had no effect. He then dodged an attack from Amande, jumped over the Candy Wall, and continued running with Big Mom pursuing him.{{Qref|chap=885}}

Luffy then escaped from Big Mom and traveled from island to island through the Mirro-World. While hiding inside a building with the captured Brûlée, Luffy wondered on how to defeat Katakuri. He then remembered about Rayleigh's lessons and expressed an interest in seeing into the future before declaring that he would surpass Katakuri.{{Qref|chap=886}} Eventually, Luffy confronted Katakuri again, clashing with him once more.{{Qref|chap=888}}

Though Katakuri pummeled him many times, Luffy kept getting back up. Luffy then calmed his mind and remembered what Rayleigh told him. He began to see into the future when he attempted to counter against a giant mochi fist. Katakuri tried to deter Luffy from continuing the battle, but Luffy refused to give up, saying that his friends were believing in him.{{Qref|chap=891}} Knowing that Luffy's Kenbunshoku Haki was improving dramatically, Katakuri tried to end the battle quickly. Just as Luffy was about to attempt to dodge his opponent's next attack, a projectile pierced his thigh, breaking his balance, allowing Katakuri the opportunity to deal a devastating blow to him.{{Qref|chap=892}}

[[File:Luffy and Katakuri's Final Clash.png|thumb|left|210px|Luffy and Katakuri meet in a final clash.]]

Luffy briefly cried out in pain before Katakuri kicked him into a wall. He then tried to strike Luffy again his mochi spear, but Luffy dodged it. Finally, Katakuri unleashed a barrage of mochi fists, pummeling Luffy into the floor. While lying down, Luffy thought back to his training with Rayleigh and got back on his feet. Flampe tried to shoot Luffy with her Silent Blowgun, but he dodged the shot. After Katakuri injured himself and revealed his face to Flampe while berating her for her interference, both Luffy and Katakuri unleashed a blast of Haoshoku Haki, knocking out Flampe and her subordinates. With no one meddling in their fight, Luffy resumed his battle with Katakuri.{{Qref|chap=893}} They continued to trade blows with each other and as they were getting worn out from the battle, Luffy activated another variation of Gear 4: Snakeman.{{Qref|chap=894}} With his increased speed and ability to home in on his target, Luffy was able to land more hits on Katakuri. However, Katakuri countered with his spiked mochi attacks. After trading more blows with each other, both fighters claimed that they would end the battle before engaging in a massive clash.{{Qref|chap=895}}

[[File:Luffy Defeats Katakuri.png|thumb|210px|Luffy victorious over Katakuri.]]

After the clash, Luffy's Gear 4 wore off and he fell into the hole created by the impact. As Luffy later climbed out of the hole, Katakuri stood and asked Luffy if he would return to defeat Big Mom. Luffy replied that he would and Katakuri collapsed and fell unconscious. With Katakuri defeated, Luffy covered his fanged mouth with his extra hat before walking away. Pekoms, while in disguise, then approached him with the captured Brûlée and told Luffy that he planned to help him escape to honor Pedro's sacrifice.{{Qref|chap=896}}{{-}}

====Final Push to Freedom====

[[File:Sanji Saves Luffy from Raisin.png|thumb|left|210px|Sanji rescues Luffy on Cacao Island.]]

While traveling to the mirror leading to Cacao Island, Pekoms explained to Luffy about the Sulong form and his plan to help Luffy escape. While exiting the Mirro-World, Pekoms sandwiched Luffy between himself and Brûlée to hide the Straw Hat. Pekoms transformed but he was viciously attacked, causing Luffy to be exposed. Sanji then grabbed Luffy and attempted to escape through the air, but they were smashed into the ground by [[Charlotte Yuen]]. Luffy and Sanji were cornered, but they were saved by the arrival of Germa 66.{{Qref|chap=897}}

As Sanji's siblings shielded them from bullets, Sanji was told to escape with Luffy, who lost consciousness. After Sanji kicked through several of the Big Mom Pirates, Brûlée revealed to them of Katakuri's defeat at Luffy's hands, causing them to become furious. In response, an enraged Oven attempted to attack Sanji and Luffy, but Ichiji repelled Oven as Sanji and Luffy fled into the air. Yuen tried to attack Sanji once more but Yonji interfered. Sanji was then shot at by several snipers, and one of them fired a missile. Niji grabbed Sanji before he was caught in the explosion and while holding onto Sanji and Luffy, Niji traveled at a high speed and took down several pirates with his sword. Niji then threw Sanji and Luffy toward the Thousand Sunny, sending them flying over the Big Mom Pirates' fleet. As the group on the Sunny sailed past the port, Sanji told his captain that their ship was within sight.{{Qref|chap=898}}

Luffy and Sanji returned to the Sunny and Chopper quickly tended to Luffy's injuries. The group was then besieged by Smoothie's fleet, but Judge came to their rescue. As the Sunny passed by Judge's castle, Judge asked Luffy why he risked his life to rescue Sanji. Instead of answering his question, Luffy thanked him. The Sunny group later saw enemy ships approaching them from the front and when the situation grew more dire, they were surprised when Wadatsumi appeared and attacked the enemy.{{Qref|chap=899}} The Sun Pirates cleared a path for the Sunny.

Luffy consented to Jinbe's decision but reminded him that as an official member of the Straw Hats, Jinbe must survive and meet up with the rest of the crew at Wano. After Jinbe joined his former crew in battle, the Sunny group sailed far away from Cacao Island.{{Qref|chap=901}}

With the Big Mom Pirates unable to pursue, the Sunny group successfully escaped Totto Land. After some rest, Sanji cooked a meal for them.{{Qref|chap=902}}

After Sanji realized that he received a raid suit from Niji during the escape from Cacao Island, Luffy and Chopper begged him not to throw it away. Carrot received a newspaper and the group read it. Luffy became depressed when he misread his new bounty as {{B}}150,000,000. Brook later took a closer look at the poster and told Luffy that he misread the amount. The group was then shocked to hear that Luffy's bounty actually increased to {{B}}1,500,000,000.{{Qref|chap=903|ep=878|ep2=879}}

Wano Country Saga
Wano Country Arc
The Adventures of Luffy-tarou
As the Thousand Sunny continued towards Wano Country, the group was informed of the Levely through a newspaper. They later encountered an unusual weather disturbance in their direction, followed by an octopus on their ship as well as a school of huge carp on their side. After a bumpy ride across a river, the ship climbed up a waterfall. After reaching the top, they came across a whirlpool. Luffy helped his group escape but was held back by the octopus before he could leave the ship. Luffy and the Thousand Sunny later washed up on a beach at Kuri and Luffy woke up when a crab pinched his nose. He then encountered a komainu and a baboon wielding a katana.[26]

Tama Takes Luffy to Her House
Tama takes Luffy to her house after he saves her from the Beasts Pirates.

While the komainu and the baboon were fighting, two Beasts Pirates scouts were riding nearby. When they spotted Luffy and the Sunny, they tried to attack Luffy, but the latter easily defeated them and saved a little girl they had captured in the process. One of the pirates ordered the baboon, known as Hihimaru, to attack Luffy, but the latter stopped the baboon with a glare. The little girl, Tama, then knocked out the enemy pirate, and the girl managed to tame Hihimaru by feeding him kibi-dango created from her own cheek. Tama explained to Luffy where he was and what had happened to her, and after taking the Sunny to a secure location, she offered to feed him as thanks. She took him to her master's house, where she made some rice dishes. After he ate, Luffy was confronted by Tama's master, who was angered that he ate the rice that she rarely got to have due to spending her life weaving kasas every day. Tama explained to her master that she gave Luffy the rice to thank him, but she then got sick due to having drank some river water that was contaminated by Kaidou's factories. Her master revealed that she had decided to continue living in Kuri to wait for Ace, who had promised to return there.[27]

Luffy then informed them that Ace died, causing Tama to become upset and pass out. Hitetsu berated Luffy for saying it so directly and told him about Ace's visit as well as the destruction of Tama's village. Luffy then offered to take Tama to the town to see a doctor, and Hitetsu told him to look for his allies. After changing his clothes, Luffy took the sword Nidai Kitetsu with him, and Hitetsu tried to stop him due to fearing its curse, but was unsuccessful as Luffy left with Tama. As Komachiyo gave them a ride through the bamboo forest, Tama accused Luffy of lying and explained about the promise Ace made to her. They later entered a wasteland and Tama explained about the terrible environment created by the Beasts Pirates before falling unconscious again. Luffy later spotted Zoro saving a woman from some of Kaidou's thugs. He then reunited with his crewmate, but they were confronted by Hawkins shortly afterwards.[28]

Hawkins Vs
Luffy and Zoro facing Hawkins.

Hawkins then read Luffy and Zoro's fortune, saying that they had 19% chance of surviving at the end of the month. As they prepared to fight, Zoro noticed the sword Luffy was carrying and asked to hold on to it, but Luffy decided to use it. As Hawkins' men attacked, Luffy used a punch instead of attacking with the blade. One of the giant lizards tried to bite Luffy, but he dodged it, grabbed it, and threw it at Hawkins, who caught it with his straw sword. Luffy was then surprised when Zoro attacked Hawkins with a flying slash to the face, but the damage was redirected to one of his men. After explaining about his Wara Wara no Mi, Hawkins conjured a giant straw entity. After he drew a card that made his men attack each other, Komachiyo dragged Luffy and Zoro away from the battle. Hawkins' straw figure pursued them until Zoro sliced it in two. After getting away from Hawkins, the woman that Zoro saved earlier introduced herself as Tsuru. Upon seeing Tama in critical condition, she asked the two Straw Hats to bring Tama to her tea shop so she could help her. They later arrived at Okobore Town.[29]

While Tama was healed by Tsuru's medicine, Luffy ate some food. After Luffy heard Tsuru's story about Okobore Town, Tsuru was attacked by the gifter Batman. During the confusion, Tama was abducted by Gazelleman. Luffy, Zoro, Kiku, and Komachiyo quickly pursued the Gifter and they headed for Bakura Town.[30]

At the town's gates, Luffy yelled out Tama's name and the group were confronted by swordsmen, but Luffy knocked them out with Haoshoku Haki. While traveling through the town, Kiku told Luffy and Zoro about the town's history. A defeated sumo wrestler was suddenly hurled towards them, but Luffy caught him with one hand. They then came across a sumo wrestling tournament where Urashima was winning matches. As Urashima's men were taking Kiku to Urashima, Luffy was amazed when Kiku sliced off Urashima's top knot with her sword.[31]

Luffy Defeats Urashima
Luffy defeating Urashima in a Sumo Match.

When Urashima tried to attack Kiku in a fit of rage, Luffy intercepted him and engaged him in a sumo match. Luffy dodged his opponent's attacks and sent him flying out of the ring and crashing into a building. Many enemies then came to confront the group. Luffy fought back, demanding the boss of the town to show up. Holed'em later arrived at the scene while holding Tama hostage.[32]

Luffy Punches Holed'em
Luffy strikes Holed'em with Red Hawk.

As Holed'em accused the group of being part of a group of thieves, Kiku warned Luffy not to anger Holed'em carelessly. She also informed Luffy and Zoro that Jack was the ruler of the Kuri region and attacking Holed'em would have serious repercussions. When the headliner Speed arrived with a wagon of food, Luffy and Zoro decided to steal it. Luffy quickly attacked Holed'em and grabbed Tama while Zoro struck down the Beasts Pirates escorting the wagon. Once he heard how Holed'em harmed Tama, Luffy dropped Tama in mid-air and turned around to attack Holed'em and struck him in the face with a powerful Red Hawk punch.[33] With Holed'em taken down, Luffy then grabbed Tama again and tried to ride on the back of Speed, thinking she was a horse. Speed got angry, but when Tama offered some kibi dango made from her body, she ate it and became subservient to Luffy and Tama, carrying them out of Bakura Town as they made their way to Okobore Town. They picked up Law along the way and once they arrived at Okobore Town, they delivered the food to the citizens and Luffy crushed three gifters who tried to stop them. As Tama ate an apple, Luffy promised her that she would not be hungry again. After scolding Luffy and Zoro for their reckless behavior, Law decided to take them to the ruins of Oden's castle.[34]

Luffy then parted ways with Tama but decided to keep the sword he took from Hitetsu. Luffy, Zoro, Law, and Kiku rode on Komachiyo as they traveled to the castle ruins. As they approached the castle, Zoro wandered off somewhere and Kiku ran away in tears. When they reached the top of the mountain, Law showed Luffy the gravestones for the Kouzuki Family, including Kin'emon, Momonosuke, Kanjuro, and Raizo. Luffy was surprised and initially thought they were dead, but Kin'emon and Momonosuke then came out to meet him and Kiku returned to embrace Kin'emon. The group that had sailed to Wano with Luffy arrived at the ruins as well, and Law took them inside to talk. There, Kin'emon revealed that he, Momonosuke, Kanjuro, and Raizo had escaped from Orochi's takeover by traveling 20 years forward in time.[35]

Luffy then listened as Kin'emon explained more about the past such as the story of Oden, the time of his execution, the rumor about Toki, and what Kin'emon's group did right after arriving at present time. Kin'emon then went over a plan to attack Onigashima, the island where Kaidou resided, in two weeks.[36] Kin'emon explained about the Fire Festival and how the decisive battle would play out. After giving the group specific tasks to do, Kin'emon gave them new clothes and summoned Shinobu to guide them. When Kaidou arrived at the Kuri region, Law alerted Luffy to his presence.[37]

Kaidou Defeats Luffy
Kaidou defeats Luffy.

Seeing Kaidou above Okobore Town, Luffy rushed off with Law following him. After Kaidou destroyed Oden Castle, Luffy responded by attacking Kaidou with a Gear 3 attack.[38] The attack knocked Kaidou to the ground with an enormous crash. Luffy then proceeded to run towards Oden Castle to check on his friends, but he came across a badly injured Speed, who told him that she tried to get Tama to safety, but Kaidou intercepted and attacked them, leaving Tama's fate unknown. Law tried to tell Luffy to flee, but an enraged Luffy decided to once again engage the Emperor. Kaidou unleashed his fire breath at him, but Luffy dodged and struck Kaidou with Elephant Gatling. This dropped Kaidou to the ground again, and he entered his human form while laying down. Luffy activated Gear 4 and unleashed an aggressive barrage of attacks on him. The attacks were ineffective and Kaidou retaliated with Raimei Hakke, rendering Luffy unconscious with a single blow.[39]
Luffy and Kid Imprisoned
Luffy and Kid imprisoned together.

Kaidou then ordered his men to imprison Luffy, deciding to break his spirit and turn him into a subordinate. As Kaidou's men surrounded Luffy, he instinctively knocked out some of them with Haoshoku Haki. On the next day, Luffy was taken to a prison at Udon and thrown into a cell next to Kid. Both Luffy and Kid swore payback against Kaidou before Luffy noticed Kid next to him.[40]

Tribulation at Udon
Luffy and Kid in Udon Prison
Luffy working alongside Kid while imprisoned in Udon's Prisoner Mine.

A few days later, both of them were competing over who could do more work at the prisoner mine. Dobon then confronted the two over the amount of kibi dango rations they acquired. He prepared to discipline them as he had his hippo put them into its mouth. However, Luffy and Kid quickly knocked out Dobon and his hippo. Luffy also picked up an injured old man and carried him on his shoulder.[41]

On the next day, the old man that Luffy helped expressed his gratitude to Luffy, who then gave Hyo some of his meal tickets in an act of kindness. While Luffy was working, Raizo appeared beside him and informed him that he located the keys to Luffy's Seastone handcuffs, but it was heavily guarded. Raizo then asked Luffy to wait a little longer before vanishing. Caribou approached Luffy and tried to talk to him with the intention of allying and escaping from the prison, but Luffy rejected him, telling Caribou to go ally with Kid. Caribou began to tell Luffy about the rumors of how Kid lost an arm, until Kid appeared and interrupted him. After Kid explained his side of the story, Luffy and Kid began arguing over who would defeat Kaidou.[42]

After news of Kid's escape from the Prisoner Mines was announced, Alpacaman tormented Luffy by spitting on him and questioned if he had helped Kid escape. When Luffy saw one of the guards attacking Hyougoro, he rushed to attack the guard.[43] Luffy then kicked the guard in the face and knocked him down, causing an uproar in the prison. The warden stepped in and attacked Luffy. Afterwards, Luffy continued with his defiance by trying to escape. Luffy and Hyougoro were then caught and brought before Queen, who attempted to convince Luffy to join the Beasts Pirates, only for Luffy to reject the offer.[44]

Luffy and Hyougoro in the Sumo Inferno
Luffy and Hyougoro competing in Queen's death match.

Luffy and Hyougoro were sentenced to fight in death matches called the Sumo Inferno. Both of them were forced to wear collars that will behead them if they step out of the ring, but they were allowed to have their handcuffs removed for combat. As the first group of opponents attacked them, Luffy instantly knocked them out with Haoshoku Haki.[45] As he defeated more opponents, Luffy tried to learn an advanced application of Busoshoku that would allow him to emit the armament to a short distance.[46] Luffy and Hyougoro were eventually confronted by Alpacaman and Madilloman. During the fight, Luffy told Hyougoro how to dodge their attacks. When Luffy told Hyougoro about trying to learn an advanced Busoshoku Haki technique, hoping to use it to break through Kaidou's scales, Hyougoro demonstrated this technique and defeated Alpacaman with it. Luffy affirmed that this was the exact technique he wanted to learn and asked Hyougoro to teach it to him.[47]

Hyougoro tried to teach Luffy, but he continued defeating opponents without making any progress. The Sumo Inferno was put on hold when night came, but Luffy and Hyougoro were left in the ring as the Beasts Pirates retired for the rest of the day. After knocking out the nearby guards with Haoshoku Haki, Luffy told Hyougoro his reason for wanting to defeat Kaidou. Afterwards, Raizo and Caribou approached the ring. Caribou told Luffy that he wanted to become his subordinate, and Luffy decided to accept his help. When Hyougoro revealed the potential allies within the prison, Luffy became eager to rally them.[48]

During the night, Luffy and Hyougoro ate oshiruko that were stolen from Queen but overate and grew fat. On the next day as the Beasts Pirates gathered around the ring, Luffy and Hyougoro prepared for the next set of matches, but Queen went to turn on the Filming Pond Tanishi.[49] Luffy then witnessed the execution of Shimotsuki Yasuie. When Luffy commented that no one should laugh when someone dies, Hyougoro explained about a side effect of the SMILE fruits.[50] As his crewmates were causing chaos at the execution site, Luffy cheered for them. He was then surprised to see that Kid had been recaptured while attempting to rescue Kamazo, who was revealed to be Killer. After Queen subjugated Kid and Killer to water torture and threatened to leave them submerged until Luffy and Hyougoro die, Luffy attempted to attack Queen, but he easily caught his punch and threw it aside. As tensions between Luffy and Queen began to heat up, they heard a loud noise coming from outside the gate.[51]

Luffy Saves Hyougoro
Luffy subconsciously uses advance Busoshoku Haki to save Hyougoro.

Luffy was then surprised to see an amnesiac Big Mom breaking into the prison. As Big Mom and Queen argued about oshiruko, Luffy told them to pull Kid and Killer out of the water.[52] Luffy was then surprised to see Big Mom overpowering Queen. He was relieved to see Kid and Killer saved from drowning after Queen crashed into the contraption holding them. When Big Mom did not find any oshiruko, Luffy unwittingly admitted that he ate the oshiruko that Big Mom was looking for. Big Mom directed her anger towards Luffy and pushed him and Hyougoro out of the ring. Fortunately, Luffy managed to remove the collars. Hyougoro stayed in Big Mom's path, hoping that Luffy could become stronger by fighting her. To protect Hyougoro, Luffy prepared to face Big Mom head on.[53]

Luffy realized that what he did to remove his and Hyougoro's death collars was the same technique that he saw Rayleigh used to remove Camie's exploding collar on Sabaody Archipelago two years ago. However, since he used it in the heat of the moment, Luffy was not sure how to activate it at will. Luffy attempted to have his Haki flow through his hands, but Big Mom instantly sent him and Hyougoro crashing into a wall. Luffy worriedly apologized to Hyougoro as he pulled him out of the wall, and Hyougoro revealed that he used Haki just in case. Hyougoro told Luffy more about the advanced usage of Busoshoku Haki before he and Luffy were separated by Big Mom, who pursued Luffy into the neighboring Prisoner Iron Factory. After running through the Prisoner Mines, he led Big Mom back to where he started, and Queen attempted another attack on Big Mom. Afterwards, Big Mom regained her memories and fell asleep. Queen and most of his subordinates quickly took Big Mom on a ship heading for Onigashima, leaving Babanuki to lead the small remainder of the crew in the prison. With communications cut off, Luffy decided to take down Babanuki and his forces and take over the prison.[54]

Luffy's Group Fights in Udon
Luffy and his allies prepare to take over Udon.

Luffy excitedly took on the Beasts Pirates rushing to attack him as he worked to advance his Busoshoku Haki at will. Babanuki then ordered the prisoners to help subdue Luffy and they obeyed his command. Luffy wondered why they were following Babanuki's orders, and they replied that they had no hope in overcoming Kaidou and Orochi, having tried and failed to rebel against them 20 years ago and losing everything in the process. Kawamatsu shouted out from inside his cell, encouraging Luffy to tell the prisoners about their hope. After Raizo freed Kawamatsu, Kiku came and forced the prisoners off of Luffy. Having reunited with Chopper and Kiku (who was revealed to have been born a boy), Luffy prepared to fight once more.[55]

Luffy and his group fought against the Beasts Pirates, but they were soon cornered by prisoners who were infected by the Mummy virus. Luffy fearlessly made contact with the infected carriers and ignited the prisoners' spirit by showing that their agonizing infected situation was no different from their life as slaves in Udon and he promised them that he and his group would liberate Wano Country from Kaidou's oppression. Babanuki prepared to use an Excitement shell, but Luffy's advanced Kenbunshoku Haki enabled him to stop Babanuki in time by tangling the trunk of his elephant, causing the shell to explode inside Babanuki's body.[56]

Luffy's Advanced Busoshoku Haki Training
Hyougoro supervises Luffy's training in advanced Busoshoku Haki.

After the prison takeover, Luffy's condition worsened. As Chopper worked to treat him, Luffy reunited with Tama and Momonosuke. Luffy made Momonosuke angry by calling him useless.[57] Chopper successfully developed a cure and treated Luffy and all those infected. Upon meeting the four yakuza bosses, they threatened Luffy for speaking casually to Hyougoro, but Hyougoro vouched for him.[58]

As the day of the Fire Festival drew closer, Luffy continued training his Busoshoku Haki with Hyougoro supervising him.[59] Luffy eventually learned how to use advanced Busoshoku Haki, and he returned to Amigasa Village with Tama and Chopper two days before the decisive battle.[60]

Raid on Onigashima
Luffy was excited to be given a new armor by Hitetsu. He then wondered about Jinbe's fate, but he was certain that Jinbe would eventually arrive at Wano Country.[61]

On the day before the raid on Onigashima, Luffy spoke with Kin'emon before the latter head out with his group. Luffy later practiced his advanced Busoshoku Haki on a tree as he expressed eagerness to fight Kaidou again.[62]

On the day of the Fire Festival, the Straw Hats, Heart Pirates, and Kid Pirates arrived at Tokage Port and entered the battle with the Beasts Pirates.[63] After rescuing Kin'emon's group, the Straw Hats were informed by the Beasts Pirates of how the rebels were prevented from gathering at Tokage Port and that Kaidou formed an alliance with Big Mom. Undeterred, Luffy, Law, and Kid then destroyed a Beasts Pirates' ship together. Afterwards, Luffy was excited to see that Denjiro arrived along with all of the Ninja-Pirate-Mink-Samurai Alliance allies.[64]

While Kanjuro fled to Onigashima with Momonosuke, Luffy was shocked to learn that Kanjuro was a spy working for Orochi. After Momonosuke ordered the alliance to press forward without worrying about him, Luffy was impressed and promised to rescue Momonosuke. As the alliance was attacked by a Beasts Pirates ship with long ranged cannons, Luffy was overjoyed to see Jinbe arriving and joining the battle.[65] With Jinbe officially part of the crew, the Straw Hats proceeded to take over the torii in front of Onigashima.[66] The crew then arrived at Onigashima with the rebels. After disembarking, Luffy received a Beasts Pirates disguise from Kin'emon.[67]

Luffy Attacks the Beasts Pirates

When the Kid Pirates went ahead into Onigashima, Luffy tried to follow them. While searching for Kid, Luffy became enraged when some Beasts Pirates members callously wasted some oshiruko, remembering how happy Tama was to receive some.[68] In a fit of rage, Luffy struck them with a Gear 3 attack. Zoro then found Luffy and berated him for causing a scene, but when Luffy explained his reasons, Zoro went along with him. During the ensuing chaos, the two Straw Hats were confronted by the surrounding Beasts Pirates. Apoo attacked and injured the duo with his Devil Fruit powers, forcing them to retreat. They were saved from Apoo when Kid landed a surprise attack on his former ally.[69]

Ulti and Page One Stumble into Luffy
Luffy comes across Ulti and Page One.

The situation became more chaotic as a Number entered the fray. As Luffy, Zoro, Kid, and Killer ran to the castle, they were able to defend against Apoo's next attack by covering their ears.[70] As Luffy fought his way through inside Kaidou's castle, he ran into Ulti and Page One.[71] When Luffy said he was going to become the Pirate King, Ulti angrily responded that Kaidou would take that title as she headbutted him. After a brief clash, Ulti managed to send Luffy crashing into the floor, but she sensed that he was unharmed and so transformed into her pachycephalosaurs hybrid form. Luffy emerged from his crater and rushed toward Ulti and Page One, and before they could react, he grabbed hold of Ulti's horns and used them to slam her into the ground before defeating Page One with Elephant Gun. Ulti then grabbed Luffy's arms and prepared to headbutt him in her hybrid form while Luffy prepared to transform into his Gear 4, but Yamato rushed in and struck Ulti with his kanabo. Yamato then picked Luffy up and ran away as the Beasts Pirates began chasing after them, and he introduced himself to Luffy while trying to take him to a private spot.[72]

Luffy Attacks Yamato
Luffy's initial scuffle with Yamato.

Luffy had no desire to meet with Yamato and so attacked him, but Yamato managed to counter his attacks before the duo engaged in a powerful and destructive clash. In the immediate aftermath of the clash, Yamato took Luffy to the attic and was able to get him to stay and talk for five minutes. As Yamato took off his mask and revealed his real appearance, he told Luffy about his devotion to Oden and asked him to fight with him to achieve the legendary samurai's dream of opening Wano's borders.[73] During their conversation, Yamato revealed to Luffy not only why he never left Onigashima (despite him wanting to do so) but also his desire to sail with Luffy's crew. They then listened to Kaidou's speech, but they fell out of the attic when the floor below them collapsed. Luffy urged Yamato to show him the way to Momonosuke before he could be executed.[74]

As they fought through the Beasts Pirates, Luffy informed Yamato that Momonosuke and his retainers were alive the whole time. Luffy then removed Yamato's handcuffs and tossed them away before they detonated and caused a huge explosion that sent them flying to the Performance Stage. Even though Kaidou and Momonosuke were in sight, Luffy waited for the Scabbards to start the all-out attack.[75] During the raid, Big Mom saw Luffy and confronted him again.

When Big Mom mocked Luffy of his mission to bring down Kaidou, Luffy stated his actual goal was to bring down both of them along with their followers in this all-out war. After Kaidou transformed into his dragon form and took the Scabbards with him to the roof of Skull Dome, Luffy stated to Kin'emon that he would catch up with them later.[76] After Luffy watched Sanji assist Shinobu in freeing Momonosuke, he became worried when King drove Sanji through a wall. Luffy decided to have Yamato assist Shinobu in protecting Momonosuke. Big Mom then resumed her attack on Luffy, further enraged that Luffy had interfered too much lately with all the festivities she had tried to enjoy. Luffy realized he had to deal with Big Mom first before he could deal with Kaidou.[77]

Straw Hats Stand United Against Beasts Pirates
The Straw Hats stand together against the Beasts Pirates.

As the battle at the Live Stage unfolded, Luffy told Shinobu to trust Yamato. He then attempted to jump to the roof of the Skull Dome along with Zoro, but Queen prevented their advance. When the other Straw Hats arrived, the crew assembled on the Live Stage.[78] The samurai fought to open a path for the Straw Hats, but they struggled to bring one of the Numbers down, so Zoro sliced its club and Jinbe saved some samurai from the falling piece while Luffy went on to attack the Number with Gear 4. At this moment, he encountered X Drake, who struck down another of the Numbers. Afterwards, Drake offered to join forces with him.[79]

Unlike Zoro, Franky, and Jinbe, Luffy immediately accepted Drake's help. As Luffy and Sanji rushed to reach Kaidou, Apoo tried to attack them, but they quickly covered their ears. When Hatcha arrived, Sanji told Luffy to ignore him, so they do not waste time with a pointless fight.[80] As they continued on, Sanji had to constantly keep Luffy from engaging in pointless fights. They were confronted by Briscola, but Jinbe arrived to aid them. After defeating Briscola, Jinbe offered to escort Luffy and Sanji to the roof.[81] The trio reached the first level of the castle, and they got past two Shinuchis along the way.[82] As they went through the third level, Sanji separated from Luffy and Jinbe. The two ran into rebels from Udon, and they built a ladder to the fourth level.[83] At the fourth level, Luffy separated from Jinbe, who decided to remain on the floor to hold back Who's-Who and his subordinates.[84]

At the fifth level, Luffy found that the Mink Tribe had cleared his way to the roof. Once he arrived there, he joined up with Zoro, Law, Kid, and Killer as they prepared to fight Kaidou and Big Mom. Luffy briefly ignored the two Emperors to check up on Kin'emon and his group, who were wounded but still alive. Luffy agreed to take Wano's fate upon his shoulders and asked Law to send the Scabbards somewhere safe. After Law did so, Luffy dodged an attack by Kaidou and struck back with a new and powerful Gear 3 attack called Gomu Gomu no Red Roc that made Kaidou bleed, shocking both Emperors.[85]

Kaidou then struck back by attacking with his club. Luffy managed to avoid the full brunt of the attack, but he was still grazed by Kaidou. Big Mom attempted to attack Luffy with Prometheus, but Zoro stepped in and cut the sun homie in two. Kaidou tried attacking Luffy again, but Law teleported Luffy to another spot. After Law berated Luffy for making it look like Law was taking orders from him, Luffy then challenged Law and Kid to a game of chicken when Big Mom launched an attack at the three captains. Not moving an inch, the three captains took the attack head on. They quickly recovered and attacked Kaidou together, but the Emperor transformed and joined Big Mom in the sky, ready to launch a counterattack.[86]

Supernovas Confront Kaidou and Big Mom

Kaidou then used a roar to unleash several wind blades on the five members of the Worst Generation. Luffy dodged them and struck Kaidou with Gomu Gomu no Kong Rifle, which injured him. Right after Killer got struck by Big Mom's Indra, Kaidou tried to chomp on Killer, but Luffy kicked Kaidou away with Rhino Schneider. Kaidou prepared to use Bolo Breath on Luffy, but Zoro had Law teleport him to in front of Kaidou so he could defend Luffy by cutting Kaidou's flames. Big Mom unleashed Tenman Daijizai Tenjin on Luffy and his allies. Luffy got struck but was unharmed due to his body being rubber. He then got hit by Kaidou's Bolo Breath, but to Kaidou's surprise, Luffy came out unscathed, claiming that it was his guts that protected him. He then struck Kaidou with Gomu Gomu no Kong Gatling.[87] Eventually, Luffy got exhausted from the stress of using Gear 4 and reverted back, forcing Zoro to protect him from both Kaidou and Big Mom's attacks. Luffy then watched as Kaidou transformed into his Human-Beast form.[88]

Luffy eventually recovered from the effects of Gear 4 and resumed fighting. Insisting that their attacks so far were being effective, Luffy kept stubbornly assaulting Kaidou and Big Mom, who repeatedly struck him away as the other Supernovas discussed a way to separate the two Emperors.[89] When Kaidou and Big Mom prepared a devastating combined attack, Luffy was able to see into the future the range and scope of the shockwave, alerting the others about it. After Zoro managed to delay the attack for an instant and Law teleported everybody to safety, Luffy attempted to punch Kaidou once more, giddily noticing that the Emperor was weakened enough to start dodging attacks instead of enduring them, thus confirming his suspicions from before. Kaidou countered Luffy's punch with a series of attacks of his own, managing to knock the Straw Hat captain out.[90]

Luffy Punches Kaidou
Luffy begins using Haoshoku Haki against Kaidou.

Like their prior confrontation at Kuri, Luffy kept "glaring" at Kaidou even while unconscious, something that Kaidou noted. Luffy did not stay down for long and, in fact, was able to deduce the secret behind Kaidou's immense power and defenses after observing the Emperor's latest attack and reminiscing his own training with Hyougoro. Telling Kaidou that he was fighting for his Wano friends and would refuse to submit to him, Luffy learned how to coat his own body with Haoshoku Haki, allowing himself to defend and counterattack Kaidou's strikes without even making contact with the Emperor. Confident that he now had a reliable way to hurt Kaidou, Luffy declared to Law and an unconscious Zoro that he would defeat him.[91] After Law left the battlefield with Zoro and Zeus, Kaidou got up and, admitting that both he and Luffy were enjoying this fight, clashed once more with the Straw Hat captain.[92]

Luffy Falls Off Onigashima
Luffy falls off Onigashima defeated.

However, Luffy lacked skill in the use of Haoshoku coating and was soon overpowered and defeated by Kaidou. The unconscious Luffy was thrown off the flying Onigashima and fell towards the sea.[93] As he sunk into the depths, the Kaidou disappointedly noted that Luffy was not able to become Joy Boy.[94]

However, as Luffy sunk into the sea, he used the Voice of All Things to transmit a message to Momonosuke, to tell his crew that he will be back and that he will win against Kaidou. He also used it to call the Heart Pirates who were aboard the Polar Tang to come and rescue him.[95] After they brought him into the ship and pushed the water out of his lungs,[96] he awoke and began demanding meat.[97]

Momonosuke's Adult Dragon Form
Momonosuke ready to assist Luffy after becoming an adult dragon.

Having reached Tokage Port, even after Luffy ate the Heart Pirates' entire stock of food, he demanded more, which they fortunately managed to procure thanks to Caribou being nearby, with months worth of provisions stored within his swamp. As he ate, he reunited with a sobbing Momonosuke, who just recently landed on the mainland thanks to Shinobu's kite, and had not long ago witnessed Kiku and Kin'emon fall before his eyes. Luffy told the boy to stop crying and to transform into his dragon form and fly him back to Onigashima.[98][99] Thanks to Caribou's provisions, Luffy regained his strength back[100] and was later amazed to see Momonosuke in his adult dragon form, thanks to Shinobu's Devil Fruit powers, asking Momonosuke to fly to Onigashima and get another chance at beating Kaidou.[101]

Yamato and Luffy Attack Kaidou
Luffy and Yamato strike at Kaidou simultaneously.

Still, Luffy was angry at Momonosuke's fear of heights, which in his eyes should be over now that he has become an adult dragon. Momonosuke then gradually overcame his fear, descending towards Onigashima, with Luffy barely hanging onto his horn. They would both pass through several parts of the castle while leaving everybody in shock about a second dragon on Onigashima. When they finally reached the roof and spotted Kaidou, Luffy was quick to transform into his Gear 4: Snakeman and attack Kaidou with Jet Culverin, unknowingly striking simultaneously with Yamato, who had been stalling Kaidou the whole time; upon noticing each other, the two were happy to see each other again at last. Shortly thereafter, Kaidou transformed into his Dragon-Form, preparing to face all three of them at once, with Luffy standing above Momonosuke, confirming his name and dream of becoming Pirate King when asked by Kaidou.[102]

After Momonosuke barely dodged Kaidou's attack, Luffy would then take over the first strike at Kaidou, but not before telling Momonosuke to bite Kaidou, hitting Kaidou with Elephant Gun and sending him headfirst into the ground. When Kaidou was preparing to attack Momonosuke after being bitten by the latter, Luffy came to Momonosuke's rescue, punching Kaidou while using Haoshoku infusion and sending him into the ground headfirst once again. Thanks to a hidden Mary on the roof, Luffy was able to transmit his message to all of Onigashima to declare that he would defeat Kaidou, boosting the morale of his allies and crew. As Kaidou transformed into his Human-Beast Form, the Emperor swung his kanabo and Luffy met it with his punch, both of them infusing their attacks with Haoshoku Haki and clashing with enough force to split the sky above Onigashima, revealing the full moon previously hidden above it.[103]

Soon after the sky-splitting clash, Luffy told Yamato to take Momonosuke and flee, wanting a chance at defeating Kaidou 1v1. When Kaidou attempted to stop them from retreating, Luffy restrained the Emperor by wrapping his legs around Kaidou's neck. Both Luffy and Kaidou then resumed their fight, once again using Haoshoku infusion,[104][105] trading blows with each other before Luffy send Kaidou back with his Gomu Gomu no Roc Gun, simultaneously falling back. However, both quickly got up, started laughing and commented on the fight finally becoming fun.[106] To Luffy's annoyance, Kaidou would then starting to drink alcohol, although he stated that he has to become stronger as he finally acknowledged Luffy's power.

Luffy kicks Kaidou
Luffy lands a critical blow on Kaidou.

When Luffy attempted to strike at Kaidou, the latter went through several stages of a special state called Shuron Hakke due to his alcohol consumption. In his Warai Jogo state, he dealt a severe blow to Luffy with Ragnaraku that created a large crack in the roof of Onigashima. Kaidou entered the Ochikomi Jogo mode in his dragon form and lamented over not being able to protect Onigashima and the time it would take to rebuild it, before using Tatsumaki Kaifu on an approaching Luffy. He then shifted to his Naki Jogo state and return to hybrid form, crying as he prepared to use Raimei Hakke on Luffy. However, Luffy was successful in dodging this attack and landed a reverse Haoshoku-infused kick on Kaidou's chin. The Emperor, still crying profusely, grabbed Luffy's leg with his tail and attempted to headbutt him. The two combatants had a headbutt clash powered by Haoshoku Haki, with their foreheads not touching. Kaidou won out the clash as Luffy remarked that Kaidou's haki was growing stronger as he was sent reeling. Kaidou then entered the final stage of Shuron Hakke, Okori Jogo and angrily fired off two Boro Breaths before he met Luffy's Gomu Gomu no Roc Gatling with Gundari Ryuseigun. However, during the flurry of attacks, Luffy blocked a swing of Kaidou's Hassaikai with Haoshoku Haki and managed to strike the Emperor's abdomen with a Haoshoku-infused kick bolstered by Gear 2 and Gear 3, seemingly damaging Kaidou significantly.[107]

When Big Mom was defeated, the two pirates were in the midst of a clash of haki-infused attacks, with Luffy being pushed back. Sensing that Linlin lost her battle, Kaidou emitted his Haoshoku Haki in rage, though Luffy expressed how impressed he was that Law and Kid managed to win. Kaidou then recalled how the two first met, before entering his Naki Jogo mode and bursting into tears, though Luffy responded by entering Gear 4: Snakeman, and barraging Kaidou with Gomu Gomu no Hydra, stating that Kaidou's ambition meant nothing to him, how this was his final Gear 4, and how he wasn't stopping till he drove the King of Beasts out of Wano.[108]

Kaidou Hits Luffy Head-On
Kaidou hits a restrained Luffy.

Kaidou was seemingly unable to respond to the omni-directional Hydra attack, and contemplated how such an attack should be impossible due to the innate nature of rubber, as he slowly transitioned to his Amae Jogo mode. Kaidou manages to escape the attack, using Nusubito Jogo and advanced Kenbunshoku, before transforming into his full beast form, grabbing Luffy in his mouth and flying high into the sky. He then let go of Luffy before firing a point-blank Bolo Breath straight down, which blasted the Straw Hat captain all the way through Onigashima. Thankfully, Luffy managed to only escape the attack by transitioning into his Boundman form and flying back to the top of the island. He then got above Kaidou and landed a Gomu Gomu no Over Kong Gun on the Emperor, which disrupted the Bolo Breath the dragon was preparing to fire. However, Kaidou quickly recovered, entering his hybrid form and using Satsuriku Jogo mode to floor Luffy with Hourai Hakke. With Luffy resolving to end this with one final hit, he quickly bounced back and charged at the Emperor with another Over Kong Gun, with Kaidou dashing at him whilst preparing another Hourai Hakke. However, CP0 agent Guernica suddenly appeared and locked Luffy's attacking arm by grabbing on to it and using Tekkai, allowing Kaidou to knock the Straw Hat captain down. Guernica escaped the strike, releasing just before the Emperor hit, whilst Kaidou could only attack in despair, as he relived another exciting battle being sabotaged by outside influence, just like during his duel against Oden,[109] leading to Luffy passing out and laying on ground as Kaidou descended towards the Live Floor after dealing with the Guernica. However, shortly afterwards, Luffy's body seemed to transform as he was seen smiling during the transformation.[110]

Luffy Activates Gear 5
Luffy in his Gear 5 form.

Luffy was then monologuing about how he could hear his heartbeat and still stand despite being defeated by Kaidou. He then jumped into the air, being transformed into a new form, awakening his Devil Fruit while calling the new form, Gear 5. In this form, he emitted a huge blast of Haoshoku Haki, taking out several Beasts Pirates on the Live Floor, before he enlarged his arm and grabbed Kaidou in his entire dragon form, dragging him onto the rooftop. He then tightly wrapped his arm around Kaidou, swinging him around before slamming him back and forth on the surface. Kaidou then retaliated, shooting a Bolo Breath at Luffy, Luffy however grapped the ground beneath him, turning it into rubber and thus reflected Kaidou's attack at him while constantly laughing due to his Devil Fruit being awakened. Kaidou then recovered and apologized for the CP0-Agent's intervention, with Luffy accepting the apology and wanting to finish his fight with Kaidou properly.[111]

While watching Luffy bouncing up and down, Kaidou told him he awakened his Devil Fruit since he was turning the ground into rubber like himself, yet he felt like the transformation was akin to that of a Zoan fruit, which confused him. Nevertheless, he bit down on Luffy and swallowed him, only for Luffy to bounce around in his insides before using Gomu Gomu no Fusen to inflate both his and Kaidou's body, causing him discomfort as the two floated up into the sky. Kaidou tried to figure out how Luffy was able to make his body being like rubber just as Luffy was about to stretch his arms through Kaidou's eyes to launch himself out of Kaidou's body using Gomu Gomu no Dasshutsu Rocket which caused additional discomfort to Kaidou. Luffy then launched himself higher into the air and made himself a giant to step on Kaidou, but Kaidou evaded and chomped down on Luffy's torso, but Luffy grabbed his head and tail and started using him like a jump rope until Kaidou used Bolo Breath to blast him far away. As Luffy recovered and ran back to him, Kaidou changed into his hybrid form and struck Luffy with Kosanze Ragnaraku, slamming his head through the roof. As Luffy pulled his head back, Kaidou remarked that their fight looked like something out of a picture book, but believed Luffy is at the end of his rope, which was confirmed when his awakened state wore off. Though Kaidou himself fell to one knee, he told Luffy that after he died, he will tell everyone how valiantly he fought, but Luffy rejected this notion and changed back, assuring Kaidou that he was not afraid of dying. Kaidou managed to slam Luffy with Hassaikai a few times before Luffy bounced off a rock at Kaidou while spinning his arms like a propeller. Kaidou tried to block his attack while also trying to figure out what Luffy's power was, claiming no one is capable of taking him down, only to get punched straight through the face by Luffy and knocked onto his back.[112]

Kaidou picked himself back up and asked Luffy who he was to which Luffy answered that he is the one who will surpass him and become the Pirate King. Kaidou acknowledged that Luffy still hasn't lost his spirit and how ridiculous his power was. He admitted he has lost a lot in this war, but believed Luffy has too, only for Luffy to retort that he will take it all back. He used Gundari Ryuseigun on Luffy but got hit multiple times by Luffy as well, whose punches stretched through him again. He then noticed smoke coming from the bottom of the roof and believed that the whole castle is on fire, and everyone will burn to death, but Luffy responded that he trusts his friends to handle the problem as Kaidou fired a Kaifu attack that Luffy dodged. He then watched as Luffy grabbed a bolt of lightning with a smile on Luffy's face.[113]

Luffy used Gomu Gomu no Kaminari to throw the bolt of lightning at Kaidou, but he sidestepped and slammed Luffy from the side, sending him flying far away again. Luffy used another lightning bolt to propel himself back to attack Kaidou again, but he quickly dodged the attack and struck Luffy on the head. As he did so, he told Luffy that having a strong Devil Fruit isn't enough to conquer the seas; Roger himself didn't have one yet he still became the Pirate King, and Kaidou said that such hurdles can only be overcome with Haki as he hit Luffy with Daiitoku Raimei Hakke, knocking him into the air again. However, Luffy grabbed Kaidou while being past the storm clouds and Kaidou tried to shake Luffy off, first by hitting his arm with Hassaikai, then changing into his full dragon form to hit him with Tatsumaki Kaifu and Bolo Breath. His efforts were futile, as not only did Luffy hang on, but inflated his other fist to a humongous size to finish Kaidou off with.[114]

Luffy Defeats Kaidou
Luffy is finally able to defeat Kaidou.

Seeing Luffy's giant fist, Kaidou decided to take it head on as he enveloped himself in fire, which finally caused Luffy to let go of him, a move Kaidou said was the right call. He told Luffy that Oden was burned to death and ever since then, the people of Wano desperately clinged onto the hope their "savior" would come. He also told Luffy that his fist would never hit him because his fire would vaporize it. However, Luffy only retorted at Kaidou that he now knew how to actually hurt him, thanks to Hygoro's teaching at Udon, replying to Kaidou he would send him to the bottom of hell before Kaidou met Luffy's Gomu Gomu no Bajrang Gun with his Shoryu: Kaen Hakke.[115] As they clashed, Kaidou commended Luffy for coming so far but believed he couldn't change the world. He did ask, though, what kind of world Luffy wanted to create, and he answered that he wanted to make a world where his friends could eat as much as they want, as his fist tore through Kaidou's attack and punched Kaidou so hard in the face he got hurled deep into the ground in front of the Flower Capital before Luffy himself passed out mid-air from exhaustion due to the fight.[116]

As Kaidou sank deeper into the ground and fell into a lava pit, Luffy exited out of Gear 5 and dropped from the sky, where he was caught by Yamato, who smiled and congratulated him and Momonosuke on their incredible feats. The impact from Kaidou landing in the pit destabilized an underwater volcano which caused it to erupt catching Kaidou and Big Mom, who had also fallen into the pit, in the resulting explosion. A bandaged Luffy smiled as he was finally declared the winner of the final battle in the skies over Wano.[117] Yamato caught Luffy as he fell, and both he and Zoro were tended to by Chopper later on, but not before he told Momonosuke to not reveal his name to the people of Wano, as he would then be treated as a hero for defeating Kaidou.[118]

A New Dawn in Wano Country
A week later, both Luffy and Zoro woke up and immediately demanded meat and booze respectively. As the crew celebrated their recovery, Luffy was shocked to see Momonosuke in his adult form for the first time, after initially not recognizing him. After the crew learned that there was going to be a massive festival to celebrate Wano's liberation, Luffy became excited to hear of it and decided to go to the baths first with his friends before partying.[119]

Luffy Learns of Emperor Status
Luffy learns of his Emperor status.

As promised Momonosuke did not reveal his name to Wano, so the citizens came to know him as Joy Boy but believed he had already left the country. Luffy proceeded to enjoy the festival with his crew and the rest of the Ninja-Pirate-Mink-Samurai alliance, along with Law and Kid's crews as well. Luffy then called for a toast celebrating the end of the long fight and the festival, when suddenly Kid barged in trying to attack him. Luffy did not acknowledge his attack however, and simply wrapped his arm around his fellow Supernova as he continued to celebrate. Kid quickly shook Luffy off and showed him the day's newspaper, which contained the formal declaration of the new Four Emperors of the Sea - Shanks, Blackbeard, Luffy, and Buggy, much to Luffy's shock.[120]

After Admiral Ryokugyu retreated from Wano when Shanks intimidated him with his Haoshoku Haki, Luffy, Zoro, Sanji, and Jinbe were sitting and acknowledged the Admiral's departure, Momonosuke's braveness, and the strong Haki they felt. Luffy sensed a familiarity with the Haki.[121] Yamato then approached them and stated his intention of not leaving with the Straw Hats but staying on the island for their peace of mind, since threats like Ryokugyu may appear more often with Kaidou now gone, to which Luffy reluctantly agreed. Marco flew up to say goodbye, having found a ship close by (the Red Hair Pirates) who were willing to take him home. Luffy tried to give his thanks for helping him during the Summit War of Marineford, though Marco coolly shrugged it off, instead stating how proud Ace would be if he could see Luffy now, with the Straw Hat captain grinning proudly at the praise.[122]

Luffy Law and Kid at Tokage Port
Luffy, Law and Kid at Tokage Port.

Later, Robin revealed that the Ancient Weapon, Pluton, was on the island, but Luffy had no interest in acquiring it. Tama then appeared with Shinobu, having become the kunoichi's apprentice, with the girl requesting to join the crew if she was strong enough next time they met, with Luffy happily agreeing. A few days later at Tokage Port, the Straw Hats decided to depart, with Luffy, Kid and Law deciding to sail to separate islands as indicated by the three Log Pose needles. Law chose to go to northeast, with Luffy and Kid drawing lots to go east, which Luffy lost, setting the Straw Hats heading to the southeast. Kid, while expressing his annoyance at the Emperors, started talking about Buggy's new crew, Cross Guild, which now has Crocodile and Dracule Mihawk supposedly "under" him, though Luffy heavily doubting this claim. Kid goes on to explain how Cross Guild was putting out bounties for Marines, now making them the hunted. After Kid received Poneglyph markings from Law, he and Killer started talking about looking for "the man with the burn mark", which got Luffy's attention.[123]

As the Straw Hats prepared to depart, Momonosuke charged at them in his dragon form before tackling Luffy as a human, and though Kin'emon started scolding the Straw Hat captain, the young shogun broke down in tears, begging Luffy to stay. Luffy then had Usopp pass him a flag, which he in turn passed on to Momonosuke. He then stated that they were waiting for Momonosuke, and knowing how childish he was on the inside, granted the shogun his Jolly Roger, telling him that in times of strife to think on their adventure and if anyone came to pick a fight, to show them the flag, as it indicates that they are also picking a fight with the Straw Hat Pirates. They then set sail, but not before Luffy gave Kin'emon, Momonosuke and Yamato an open invitation to join his crew, should they ever wish to become pirates. The Sunny and the Polar Tang set course to Mogura Port, where there is a gondola which could safely transport them to the sea. However, after Kid taunted the other two captains for taking the safe route, Luffy and Law took control of their respective ships and, despite their crews' protests, sailed it over the Koi-climbing Waterfall with the Kid Pirates,[124] with the resulting fall breaking one of the Sunny's looms.[125]

Final Saga
Egghead Arc
Once the Sunny landed at the bottom of Wano Country's waterfall and the Straw Hats recovered, Luffy was severely beaten by Nami and placed in a cage; he apologized for his reckless actions and pleaded to be let out.[26] Later, Luffy was released and learned from the newspaper that Nefertari Vivi was missing, her father Nefertari Cobra was dead and Sabo was credited with his killing. Luffy grew angry and distressed at this, proclaiming that Sabo would never do something like that and wanting to go to Mary Geoise to rescue Vivi. However, Zoro talked him down, saying it would be foolish to attack the city and that they needed to let Vivi live her own life until they knew for sure it was necessary to act. Robin then revealed the news that Buggy was now one of the Four Emperors, which a surprised Luffy believed was a mistake. She offered to share more news regarding other people Luffy knew, but Luffy declined unless it was truly bad. Luffy then reaffirmed Sabo's innocence and revealed the dream he had shared to Sabo and Ace 12 years ago; the revelation of this dream provoked a strong response from the Straw Hats, with reactions ranging from delighted laughter to stunned silence. However, everyone supported it and expressed a drive to find the final Road Poneglyph that would allow them to reach Laugh Tale.

Days later, the Straw Hats entered a bitterly cold area as they drew closer toward their next island. Luffy saw a gigantic warm eddy and then noticed something inside of it, causing Zoro to cut it open. The strong winds blew Chopper overboard and Luffy stretched out to grab him, but was swept overboard as well. The mysterious figure then emerged from the eddy, revealing herself to be a child Jewelry Bonney.[27] Luffy stretched out his other arm to grab Bonney, but they were then attacked by a giant Mecha-Shark living in the water, causing the three of them to fall into the ocean. Jinbe dove in to save them, and was forced to take them deep down to escape the Mecha-Shark. They made their way to a cave in the coast of the island, where they dried their clothes and Bonney explained to Luffy that she was a fellow member of the Worst Generation. Luffy wished to look for a restaurant to get food, but Bonney said he would not find one as this was the Future Island Egghead, which contained Vegapunk's laboratory.[28] Bonney revealed that she came here to take revenge on Vegapunk for turning her father into a mindless cyborg.

Fabiriophase
Luffy, Jinbe, Chopper, and Bonney in the Fabiriophase.

Luffy, Chopper, Jinbe, and Bonney ventured into the cave and accessed Egghead's surface via a ladder, where they found themselves surrounded by futuristic machines. However, Luffy found that a lot of the creatures and food around him were nothing more than holographic illusions. Atlas, a satellite of Vegapunk, then appeared and Luffy punched her to see if she was real, causing her to get angry and punch him back. However, he landed against the Cooking Machine which could make any food on demand, which he, Chopper, and Bonney gorged on. When Jinbe asked Atlas who she was, she responded that she was Vegapunk, which Luffy and Chopper took at face value.[29] Once the group had eaten their fill, Atlas departed, and Luffy discovered a machine which gave him new clothes. The rest of the group used the machine as well, but were then approached by a police Pacifista which attacked them for using the cooking and clothing machines without paying. Luffy moved to launch a counterattack against it, but was kicked away by Bonney, who believed that the Pacifista was her father Kuma. Knowing this was not the case, Luffy rushed to save her from its laser attack.[30] Following the blast, Bonney used her Devil Fruit ability to change everyone's ages, causing the Pacifista to no longer recognize them. As they recovered, they talked with Bonney about Kuma's past and how he came into the World Government's service.[31]

Vegapunk's Dream
Luffy meets Vegapunk.

Luffy's group resumed exploring Egghead, and came to the ruins of a very old mecha in a big scrap heap.[32] While trying to get it to activate, a sudden burst happened as an old man, the original Vegapunk, appeared with half of his body inside the mecha due to a failed teleportation experiment. Luffy pulled him out, and noticed that he was floating, which Vegapunk revealed was a function of the DOM Shoes they were all wearing. However, their attempts to activate this caused them to blast high into the air.[33] Following this, Vegapunk explained more about himself to the pirates, including how he split his consciousness into six satellites which included Atlas. Bonney then tried attacking Vegapunk with his Beam Saber invention, but fainted after the beam attracted a horde of bugs. Vegapunk talked to Luffy about Momonosuke and his dragon transformation, revealing it was the result of his artificial Devil Fruit creation. Luffy then asked about the mecha, and Vegapunk revealed that it was the Iron Giant, which had been built 900 years ago and attacked Mary Geoise 200 years ago. Vegapunk then asked Luffy to take him off of Egghead.[34] When Luffy asked why, Vegapunk revealed his main dream of creating a free and abundant energy source for the whole world, an energy which once powered the Iron Giant centuries ago. However, this research caused him to delve too deep into forbidden history, resulting in the World Government now looking to eliminate him. Vegapunk then noted that CP0 was now on Egghead, and reiterated his request to sail with Luffy. Luffy agreed because he liked the scientist's funny-looking head, and Vegapunk requested he take Bonney to the Labophase above the clouds before this area became a warzone, saying he would meet them up there as he suddenly disappeared into thin air.[35]

Luffy Vs Lucci Rematch
Luffy and Lucci clash after two years.

As Luffy's group started heading to the requested location, they ran into Rob Lucci, who had just taken down Atlas using Rokuogan.[36] Initially ambivalent toward Lucci, Luffy became angry upon seeing what had happened to Atlas due to Atlas giving him food, and activated Gear 5 to fight the CP0 agent. Lucci countered by activating his awakened leopard Zoan form, and the two of them engaged in a fierce battle. In the midst of their sparring, Sentomaru arrived with the Seraphim S-Snake, S-Hawk, and S-Bear to counter CP0's invasion, but was struck down by Lucci while distractedly conversing with Luffy.[37] Sentomaru managed to remain conscious to prevent CP0 from assuming control over the Seraphim, and Luffy used his environment and awakened abilities to keep Lucci away from him, overwhelming the CP0 agent. Sentomaru told Luffy to go and get Vegapunk off Egghead, and Luffy joined Chopper, Jinbe, and a now-conscious Bonney as they took the Vacuum Rocket up to the Labophase, which they reached in seconds.[38]

Bonney quickly raced into the Labophase, still intent on getting revenge on Vegapunk, and Luffy and Chopper raced after her to stop her. He, Chopper, and Jinbe reunited with Nami, Usopp, Sanji, Robin, and Franky, but lost track of Bonney and Vegapunk in the process.[39] Luffy and Chopper went to look for the two of them,[40] but could not find them even after searching the entire Labophase, returning to the control room with the rest of the Straw Hats, all six of the Vegapunk satellites, and undercover CP0 agent/Vegapunk ally Stussy, who had incapacitated Lucci and Kaku. Satellite Shaka noted that they had lost control over the Frontier Dome that protected the Labophase from outside attack, meaning they were unable to get out of it. He told the group to do what they could to find the main Vegapunk, and as they all dispersed, Luffy remained in the room along with Zoro to recover from his exhaustion and watch over Lucci and Kaku.[41] Originally able to hear everyone through a headset, the signal cut out and Luffy went to Shaka to find out what was going on. Shaka revealed that the camera feeds around the Labophase were being rapidly cut off, meaning there was an enemy on the loose inside the Labophase. Zoro then called for help, and Luffy and Shaka raced to him to find S-Hawk and S-Bear had arrived. The two Seraphim began attacking despite Shaka's orders, making him realize that one of the Vegapunks had ordered them to attack.

Luffy attacks S-Bear
Luffy repeatedly punches S-Bear although with no lasting damage.

Now conscious, Lucci and Kaku proposed that Luffy and Zoro free them of their Seastone shackles so they could team up against the Seraphim, which the two Straw Hats found unappealing.[42] Kaku promised they would go back in handcuffs once they were finished, and Luffy believed this, forcing Zoro to explain Kaku was lying. However, Luffy ultimately agreed to free them, saying he would beat them if they tried going after his friends. Luffy activated Gear 4 and he and Lucci performed a combined attack against S-Bear, while Zoro and Kaku attacked S-Hawk.[43] Despite their powerful combined attacks, the Seraphim were able to get up little worse for wear; however, Zoro did notice that their physiologies were similar to King, who was a member of the rare Lunarian Tribe. As the battle raged on, Shaka departed to join the search for the main Vegapunk.[44] With the knowledge that the Seraphim's strength was dependent on the flames on their backs, Luffy's group moved to diminish those flames, to little initial success. S-Hawk then disappeared suddenly, and Lucci revealed that it was going to eliminate its weakest targets first. Zoro raced after it, and Luffy told Kaku to go with Zoro before turning his attention back to S-Bear.[45] At some point, Luffy approached S-Snake while calling her Hancock, and requested she undo the petrification on his friends, which she agreed to do due to her seeming affection for Luffy.

York Captured
York being held captive by the Straw Hats and CP0.

By the next day, the culprit, York was eventually found and outmatched by the Straw Hat Pirates and their allies, who subdued and chained her to the ground.[46] The entire group then listened in on York's forced conversation with the five elders. After York had revealed she had been captured by the Straw Hats, surprising the elders and everyone else listening, Luffy stated while eating that he did not fully understand the situation, but was prepared to use York as a shield against the Marines, prompting Bonney to state that they were in a hostage situation.[47] Luffy then introduced himself to the Five Elders, and stated that he and his crew were Vegapunk's allies, and that if they care about York's safety, they should call off the Marine fleet at the shore, surprising everyone in the room. Just as he was about to tell the elders who is alive in the Labophase with him, Robin stopped him from telling them too much. Luffy then apologized and asked them nicely to back down, with Usopp angrily telling him to quit dreaming.

Later in the Labophase, when Vegapunk talked to Nami about their next destination, Luffy and Usopp both got excited when Vegapunk stated that one of the needles Nami's log pose was pointing towards leads to Elbaf. They then made plans with Vegapunk to escape Egghead using Vegaforce-01 to carry the Sunny over the Marine fleet, and then use a Coup de Burst to finish escaping, but first, they needed to deactivate the frontier dome. When Vegapunk tasked Lilith with piloting the robot, Franky, Luffy, and Bonney went with her to the robot and the Sunny, with Lilith being happy that she finally got to leave the island and Luffy and Bonney both stating that they would miss the food, but Luffy then told her that Sanji would just cook for them, exciting Bonney. When Luffy asked Bonney why she was in such a good mood, she told him that she felt better now that she no longer wanted Vegapunk dead, with Luffy thanking her for finally stop crying, leading her to yell at him. As the group arrived at the Thousand Sunny, Luffy felt an intense presence below as Kizaru warped onto the island.[48] While Vegaforce-01 began to move the Thousand Sunny to the back of the island, with Luffy and his group being carried by it as well, Kizaru swiftly defeated Sentomaru. Kizaru wasted no time, and quickly warped up to the Labophase using his Devil Fruit. Luffy noticed this, and while his group continued to flee with the Thousand Sunny, he chose to confront Kizaru alone. The two shared a short greeting that was interrupted by Luffy instantly going for a strike against Kizaru, who blocked. Luffy then proudly declared that he and his crew were 100 times stronger than they were two years prior, with both Luffy and Kizaru starting to fight each other.[49]

Luffy Grabs Borsalino
Luffy protecting Vegapunk from Kizaru.

Transforming into "Snake-Man" and barraging Kizaru with a flurry of punches, it forced Kizaru on the defensive as he attempted to block. Kizaru admitted that Luffy had become quite the opponent, and inquired as to why he would choose to help Vegapunk. While responding to Luffy asking him the opposite, Kizaru warped far away, which left Luffy wondering how far away he went. Kizaru stated that he didn't actually want to kill Vegapunk, and that Luffy needed to stay out of his way. Kizaru then warped back, kicking Luffy at the speed of light, and launching him straight through the Vegaforce-01, causing it to drop the Thousand Sunny and subsequently explode in the process. The impact didn't slow Luffy down, however, and he flew right into the Frontier Dome, causing an explosion. Luffy fell down all the way down to the lower part of Egghead, and once again had to pass through the Frontier Dome on his way back up, severely burning him in the process. Just before Kizaru could kill Vegapunk, Luffy revealed himself in his Gear Fifth form and grabbed Kizaru with his giant hand, much to Kizaru's horror.[50]

Gomu Gomu no Dawn Stamp
Luffy fighting Kizaru's clones.

Luffy lifted the now calm Kizaru into the air and ignored his remarks as he revved up a throw. Luffy then flung Kizaru right out of the Labophase, and off of Egghead itself. During this short down-time, Luffy shrinks back down to his regular size. Not too much later, many orbs of light begin to appear from Kizaru, which then all form into clones of Kizaru, much to Luffy's shock. Luffy is slashed across the cheek by one of the clones, and decides to retreat a bit, allowing him to take all of the Kizaru clones out in a single attack. Before Luffy could even catch his breath, he turns around to witness Usopp, Nami, and Brook being attacked by another Kizaru clone. To make matters worse, a different Kizaru clone was attempting to shoot the fleeing Vegapunk using a laser, forcing Luffy to take the laser blast by eating it, causing him pain from burning.[51]

Gomu Gomu no White Star Gun
Luffy strikes down Kizaru.

Luffy managed to shrug off the laser, and went on to battle Kizaru himself. The two traded blows equally, but Kizaru commented that fighting Luffy was not in his interests, nor was it part of his job at the moment. Luffy stated that it was his own job to keep Kizaru occupied, but Kizaru responded by simply teleporting away using his Devil Fruit ability. Luffy angrily followed him as Kizaru made his way to intercept Vegapunk and kill him before he could make it back to the Labophase. Kizaru ended up failing to kill Vegapunk, although he did prevent him from making his way back up, resulting in Vegapunk falling back down to the Fabiriophase. Luffy managed to arrive in time to prevent Kizaru from causing more damage, and Kizaru inquired on how much longer Luffy could hold his transformation for. Kizaru fired a laser as Luffy prepared an attack, but to Luffy's benefit, the laser gave him the momentum he needed to spin around and strike Kizaru in the side of the head, landing a critical blow. Kizaru was launched through a building, while Luffy himself finally gave out and fell as well.[52]
Saturn Targets Luffy
Luffy being targeted by Saturn.

Luffy found himself completely worn out, unable to fight anymore. Jaygarcia Saturn, who had been spectating the fight between Luffy and Kizaru, decided to take advantage of this moment of weakness. Saturn went for a finishing strike on Luffy using one of his legs, but at the last second, Franky used Strong Right to punch Luffy out of the way, saving his life. Franky retracted his arm and pulled Luffy away from Saturn, who noted that it was interesting how Luffy's crew stuck together. Saturn then declared that Luffy and Jewelry Bonney's presence on the island was unexpected, but of no consequence.[53] Still worn out, Luffy asked for food and meat to replenish his stamina, but was unable to get help. However, through unknown means, he managed to get a pile of food and began eating, leading to Saturn ordering the Marines in the area to place seastone cuffs on him.[54] However, after the sudden appearance of Bartholomew Kuma, who saved his daughter and punched Saturn, the Marines reported that Luffy had vanished before they could restrain him.[55] Luffy was later found near the food dispensers by the Marines, who tried to apprehend him while he was still bloated from over-eating.[56]

Gomu Gomu no Dawn Gatling
Luffy pummels Saturn.

Before the Marines could place seastone cuffs on Luffy, they were launched into the air by an explosion. Luffy then activated Gear Fifth again and used it to save Kuma and Bonney from Kizaru by punching the Admiral away. He also turned the ground of Egghead rubbery to let Sanji, Franky, Bonney, Kuma and Atlas land safely, and the Marines remarked that the island seemed to be shaking as a result of his power. Finally, Luffy jumped into the air laughing in his signature Nika pose, and the injured Vegapunk informed Bonney that Luffy was indeed Sun God Nika.[57] Luffy spotted Bonney and asked why she was crying, Bonney replied it was because she was looking for him and didn't realize that he was Nika (to which Luffy was not aware of either). Luffy then asked her what was up with the weak punch she tried throwing, she replied that she tried to use a rubbery punch like his and told him to show her how it's done and to avenge Vegapunk, who was stabbed by Saturn. Luffy was surprised to see Vegapunk injured but quickly agreed to avenge him after he was mocked by Saturn, and he then used a new move called Dawn Gatling to attack the Elder and send him flying into a building. Kizaru then attempted to kill Bonney and Vegapunk with a laser but it was blocked by Sanji, and the Admiral then grew dismayed at the situation he was in as he prepared to face off against Luffy and Sanji.[58]

Gomu Gomu No Dawn Cymbal
Luffy smashes Kizaru and Saturn together.

Vegapunk told the pair he could not move lest he die from his wounds. Luffy reminded Vegapunk of their promise to him, but Vegapunk declared that he had to protect things on Egghead, and asked him to look after Bonney now that her control over the Pacifista was known to the Marines. At this point, Saturn returned in his Beast form and attacked the group with venom-coated legs. Luffy dodged and instructed Sanji to bring Vegapunk to safety over the latter's protests, only for Kizaru to impale Vegapunk. Sanji quickly hurried off to protect Vegapunk from further harm as Luffy grew to a tremendous size, grabbed Kizaru and Saturn and told the pair he would not let them escape.[59] Luffy heard Vegapunk's broadcast begin while he was still holding onto Kizaru and Saturn, although he was confused by it. Moments later, he realized that his punches had little effect on Saturn, prompting both the Elder and Kizaru to attempt attacks on him. Both attacks missed, but Luffy decided that he would continue to hold both of them back until his friends had a chance to escape Egghead. Luffy then unleashed a new attack titled Dawn Cymbal, pancaking Kizaru and Saturn together. He then flung the two away, with Kizaru crashing into a Marine ship, but Saturn somehow changed his trajectory and flew right back at Luffy. He was forced to dodge Saturn's attacks, and was left dumbfounded as Magic Circles began to appear all around his adversary.[60]

Sun Saw
Luffy reunites with Dorry and Brogy.

Luffy then witnessed the rest of the Five Elders appear from the circles before him in their Awakened Zoan Forms, while Luffy dodged Saturn's attack he noted the Sandworm was burrowing underground. When the Sandworm swallowed him, Dorry and Brogy arrived and decapitated it, freeing Luffy, who was overjoyed to see them again.[61] Luffy and the Giants were both both glad to see each other after two years and they were also surprised to see his Gear 5 appearance, remarking that it was identical to a God in Elbaf. They explained the current situation to Luffy and how it was time to escape from Egghead, Dorry blew his Viking horn, signaling this message to his crew. Topman Warcury then arrived, and stated that escape was impossible and used a roar burst of Haoshoku Haki, that stripped off Luffy’s eyes, hat, shoes, cuffs, and his scar's (placing them back afterward). Warcury questioned why the Giant's decided to help Luffy and went on the offensive but was then knocked away by the Giants and Saturn intervened stating they would be erased from history along with Luffy and proceeded to fire venom balls at them. Luffy then grabbed a nearby tree and chipped away at it using his teeth, turning it into a baseball bat. He then painted it, put the number 56 on it , and put on a baseball helmet to knock the venom balls back at the Elders, which to his surprise, caused an explosion. Luffy then told the Giant's that it was time to run as the Elders were immortal and they would keep coming back no matter what attack they use.[62]

Luffy Attacks Warcury
Luffy attempts to attack Warcury.

As the trio began to make their escape once more, Ju Peter used one of his abilities to make his large mouth similar to a vortex, causing Luffy and his allies to be stopped and potentially sucked in. In response, Luffy broke a nearby building, and proceeded to throw it straight into Ju Peter's mouth, effectively neutralizing him for the time being. However, the exertion caused Luffy to run out of stamina, resulting in him returning to his regular form. To Luffy's luck, Brogy offered him some of their Hákarl, which effectively revitalized him in seconds. Just as Luffy regained his strength, Warcury made a reappearance in the form of a charge. In response, Luffy attempted to use Gomu Gomu no Red Roc, striking Warcury's head. To Luffy's detriment, he found Warcury's skin to be exceptionally durable, resulting in his hand being hurt.[63] As the three ran, Warcury's flames begun to catch up to Dorry and Brogy, Luffy enters Gear 5th form again and tries to stop Warcury. Brogy warned Luffy that attacking Warcury would not work, only for him to strike Warcury, leading Luffy to hurt his hand once more, forcing them to flee.[64][65]

Bonney And Luffy Become Nika
Luffy and Bonney transform.

To their luck, Warcury and Ju Peter eventually abandoned their pursuit and left to deal with more important matters, allowing the three to escape undeterred.[66] After running for quite some time, the trio managed to finally arrive at the Giant's ship, leaping on just as it was preparing to depart Egghead. Luffy almost immediately expressed his approval of the ship, although he was also concerned about the status of Usopp and Chopper, whom he expected to be there. In order to regain his strength, Luffy quickly ate a pre-made meal for him by the ship's cook, asking the cook to make even more for later. During this time, Marcus Mars used his ability to chase after the ship, firing an energy beam, and catching part of the ship on fire. Mars would go on to declare that none of them would escape alive. Due to the apparent threat, Luffy transformed back into his Gear 5 form and encountered Bonney, asking her for assistance. She began to discount her abilities compared to his, but Luffy responded by giving her words of encouragement, allowing Bonney to realize her potential. Bonney used her ability to transform into a similar form to Luffy's, growing to the size of a giant and gaining similar features.[67]

Gomu Gomu No Dawn Balloon
Luffy uses Gomu Gomu No Dawn Balloon to blast Mars away.

Luffy expressed his excitement about the upcoming fight, and Bonney's new abilities, inspiring the Giants, and terrifying the Marines in the process. Unfortunately, Mars decided to make his move at the same moment, firing an energy beam at Luffy, and burning him. Luffy quickly ordered his allies to strike him as hard as they could, while he grabbed ahold of Mars. Luffy used his abilities to balloon his torso, but was still met with severe pain as his allies used Haki to strike him from behind. Despite this, Luffy shoved Mars into his chest as the former prepared his attack. Using his own strength, and that of his allies, Luffy used Gomu Gomu No Dawn Balloon to blast Mars far into the distance, sending him flying out of sight. Moments later, Peter would make another attempt to prevent escape by sucking up the Giant's ship. Luffy struck Peter to stop the attack, but was unable to prevent Warcury from running by. Warcury jumped off the coastline in an attempt to stop the ship, but suddenly, the Iron Giant made a surprise appearance by punching Warcury away, shocking Luffy.[68]

Liberating Nika Punch
Luffy and Bonney overwhelm Saturn.

The Iron Giant would then turn to Luffy, although he was confused when it addressed him as Joy Boy. The robot declared its intention to fight for Luffy, and moved to face the Elders in his steed. Luffy would later be shocked as the Giant's weapons failed, resulting in it being damaged. To make matters worse, Saturn used the moment to leap onto the Giant Warrior Pirates' ship, declaring that he refused to let Bonney and Kuma escape him.[69] Saturn quickly went on the attack, using his legs to attempt to stab the Giants and Bonney. Luffy quickly leaped to Bonney's defense, preventing Saturn from harming her while she made her recovery. After a few moments, Bonney was restored to full strength, and declared her own intention to defeat Saturn. Saturn mocked her abilities, but Luffy joined her at her side. The two unleashed a flurry of punches strong enough to blow holes through Saturn's body, knocking him back off of the ship. While this occurred, Vegapunk's pre-recorded message to the world continued and neared it's end, as Luffy laughed cheerfully unaware that Vegapunk informed everyone that the fate of the world would be in the hands of whoever was able to find the One Piece.[70]

Straw Hats And Giants Celebrate
Luffy is forced to celebrate, despite being incapacitated.

Moments later, Luffy looked back to the Iron Giant to find it severely damaged, due to attacks from the Elders. The Iron Giant apologized to Luffy for mistaking him for Joy Boy, before asking for his name. Luffy shouted his name to the Giant, who immediately took notice of the "D." in it. The Iron Giant then undid a knot somewhere on its body, resulting in a massive burst of Joy Boy's Haki suddenly being unleashed upon the entire island. Luffy was left completely shocked as the Haki forced most of the Five Elders back to Mary Geoise, knocked out most of the Marines, and made escape a much easier task. At the same time, the Sunny landed near Luffy, who was questioned by his crew on what had happened, although he simply stated that he had no idea.[71] After taking in the situation, Luffy yelled back a thank you to the Iron Giant, and laughed when he got no response, as the machine was no longer powered. Moments later, Luffy's stamina ran out again, and he dropped back down onto the Sunny, where he was cradled by a concerned Nami. At the same time, the Giants announced that they were heading out. While partying, Brogy picked up Luffy for the celebration, but the pirate weakly begged for them to wait for him to regain his strength.[72]

Chopper:
-----------------------------
Personality
Overview
Chopper is naïve and extremely timid towards unfamiliar humans, often acting like a child because he does not know any better. Like Luffy, he is easily impressed at things like beams, cannons and hidden abilities. He is a coward at times like Usopp and Nami, although his cowardice can be attributed to his childishness and overall lack of trust in his own fighting skills (a contrast to Nami's self-survival-based cowardice and Usopp's insecurity-based cowardice). He would rather run and hide than fight but becomes more courageous when others are there to support him. Chopper is more or less on a journey to define himself, seeing almost anyone on his team as a role model and in some cases, imitate their behavior, especially Usopp.

Being the youngest, Chopper is the most emotional Straw Hat and very much considers the crew his "family", when forced to be part of the Foxy Pirates during the Davy Back Fight Chopper was distraught and cried that he was a Straw Hat and only stopped bawling when Zoro ordered him to "man up".

After the timeskip, Chopper seems to have grown more confident, much like Usopp. He no longer strives to be looked at as a human, now only wanting to "be a monster that can help Luffy" as he put it. He even has grown mature enough to smack his crewmates, mostly Zoro and Luffy, when they try to do something stupid or extreme. He also seems to have outgrown most habits mentioned above, but his habit of peeking still remains.

Chopper Reacts to Milky
Chopper's reaction to Milky.

Chopper is capable of romance, though he shows no interest in human females. However, he was blushing around the reindeer mink, Milky, acting in a very Sanji-like manner with love hearts replacing his eyes.[13]
Kindness
Immensely kind-hearted by nature, Chopper is an upright friend and caring companion who will try anything to overcome a task given by his team. Even back when he was Hiriluk's assistant, he would go to extreme lengths just to acquire a mushroom which he thought would cure Hiriluk's chronic disease.

Chopper seems to be very forgiving of those close to him, for when Usopp wanted to rejoin the crew at the end of the Enies Lobby Arc, he called out to Luffy and Zoro, although they were ignoring him completely.

Doctor's Code
“	I will be all curing medicine. A doctor that can cure anything. A doctor that can cure countries! Because there is no such thing as incurable disease.	”
— Chopper expressing his determination to Kureha[citation needed]

His dream is to carry out his deceased mentor, Hiriluk's belief that there is no incurable disease, and to become a doctor that can cure any illness. To this end, his childish nature vanishes whenever his medical skills are required. He does not hesitate in the least in any actions regarding the well-being of his patients.

An extremely dedicated follower of the Hippocratic Oath, Chopper strongly believes that a doctor's duty is supposed to help save people and becomes angered when somebody treats life without proper respect, similar to how Sanji believes a cook's duty is to feed anyone who's hungry and gets offended easily by anyone wasting food respectively. This was why he was greatly furious at his former hero, Dr. Hogback, when the man treated the patients' and Zombies' lives, and deaths, so callously. He was also utterly enraged at Caesar Clown for kidnapping and experimenting on children as well as making them addicted to drugs. Adhering to his beliefs, Chopper would readily help any injured victims or patients he comes across and does it with immense determination. He was determined to help Mocha and the other children who were tricked into becoming test subjects in Caesar's deadly experiments. Similarly, Chopper wasted no time in treating the Mink Tribe after they were brutally devastated by the Beast Pirates. Also, Chopper holds his position as a doctor in high regards and will become distraught if he failed to save someone. When Luffy was on the verge of death from eating the skin of a poisonous fish, Chopper tried every antidote with no success, causing him to claim he had no right to call himself a doctor.

Due to his morals, Chopper is infuriated by those who use artificial diseases as weapons like the Beasts Pirates did with the Mummy virus. During the raid at Onigashima, he was willing to help allies and enemies alike who were infected by Queen's Ice Oni and stated that anyone who uses it as a weapon will eventually lose control of it.

Due to his strong belief in the Hippocratic Oath, Chopper, unlike a majority of the male members of the crew, does not actively enjoy fighting, despite being a pirate. In fact, it's been shown that Chopper mostly fights only for self defense, or to protect his friends, crewmates, loved ones, and finally his patients. He would rather not harm anyone if he doesn't have to, however; after his fight with Gedatsu his resolve towards actively fighting against people becomes slowly less defensive, and after the timeskip his resolve to fight has grown even further. There have only been a few examples of Chopper openly choosing to harm someone outside of the traditional running gags, fights and interactions that he has with his crew:

When Chopper tried to fight Wapol to avenge Hiriluk's death, only to be stopped by Dalton.
When Wapol returned a couple of years later to take back his kingdom and castle, Chopper openly fought to keep him from claiming either.
When he tries to smash Hogback's head in after seeing the doctor's complete disregard for both the lives of the living and the lives of the Zombies he creates.
When he attacks the Franky Family alongside Luffy, Zoro, and Sanji out of rage for them beating up Usopp and stealing their money from him.
When he joined the rest of the crew in fighting back against Oars.
When he loses control of himself while in his Monster Point transformation before learning to control said form.
When he fights Queen in his Monster Point transformation, after curing everyone from one of Queen's artificial plagues, stating his anger towards Queen's usage of man-made viruses, as well as his complete disregard for his own allies' lives, assaulting Queen in said form for as long as he could.
Love For Sweets
Chopper has a sweet tooth and can be just as gluttonous as Luffy when it comes to eating sweets. True to his epithet, his favorite food is cotton candy and he will gleefully accept any opportunity to enjoy this treat. Alongside Luffy, he was ecstatic when arriving in Totto Land, which is made entirely of sweets and even devoured an entire chocolate cafe on Cacao Island. While Chopper and Carrot hid inside the gigantic wedding cake during the mission to save the Vinsmokes, Chopper constantly eats it non-stop.

Running Gags
That Doesn't Make Me Happy
Chopper doing the "Dirty Old Man" dance.

He still has a feeling of distrust for humans from his youth, and will often outright insult and claim that compliments do not make him happy even though he is obviously happy about it (he starts to do the "Dirty Old Man" dance which was a bit by famous Japanese comedian Ken Shimura, which became a running gag).[14][15] At least once, Chopper has done this dance while in Monster Point, in which case it did not look cute and only managed to disturb Usopp, who had caused Chopper to react this way by praising his newfound usefulness in being able to now control this form.

Another one of Chopper's habits is his reverse cartoon peek, where he stands behind a wall or a doorway and peeks at people, trying not to be seen by them. Unfortunately, he is not hiding his body behind the wall and as a result, his body is visible and only one half of his face is hidden.

A running gag is that Chopper will believe just about anything he hears, making him easy prey for Usopp's stories and his "Sogeking" disguise. He also believed Nami when she lied to Lola about being a man, even though the truth was very obvious. In fact, until Jinbe stated otherwise, he thought that the captain's duty was not to listen to anyone. Chopper also believed the Fake Straw Hat Crew were the real Straw Hats despite them looking nothing like their real counterparts.

Another running gag is that various characters think Chopper is a tanuki (raccoon-dog, often simply translated as "a raccoon") while in his Brain Point or hybrid form which greatly annoys him and constantly trying to correct them.

He also tends to panic quickly, and subsequently, let some crucial facts slip his mind. One example is when there is someone who is injured, he often panics and screams "Call a doctor!!". It is not until he figures out that he is the doctor that he starts to tend to the injured person. Another one is when he (and Brook) jumps into the water without hesitating to save Luffy from drowning, only to drown with him (since the Devil Fruit which he had eaten makes it impossible for him to swim). He, together with Brook and Luffy, ends up being saved by the other members of the crew.
Relationships
Crew
Notably, Chopper originally was not hired to be the ship's doctor by Luffy, but just for being a "talking transforming reindeer monster". The other boys of the crew have often mentored Chopper on what it means to be a real man, as he is the youngest crewman, not originally human, and has had a relatively sheltered life. Within his combat relationships, he has at least three canon team attacks, and as a homage to his personality (which can be easily influenced), each of the attacks are named with half of the other crew member's name and half of his name. All of the examples feature the fellow crew member's name first in the name then his own such as "Hissatsu Uso-Cho Hammer Suisei" where Usopp's name is the first mentioned.

Monkey D. Luffy

Chopper, Usopp, and Luffy playing in the grass.

Within the group, Chopper often fools around with Luffy for laughs and is one of the first to join in with Luffy's antics. Although he tends to fool around with him the most, he has also received some of his greatest motivation from Luffy. His mentor Dr. Hiriluk originally introduced Chopper to the concept of being a pirate and the conviction behind the pirate flag, but Luffy was the first real-life pirate that he got to witness, in the Drum Island Arc. He was amazed by how much Luffy as the captain cared for his crew, as demonstrated by the lengths he went to for Nami and Sanji. He was awestruck when Luffy took head-on attacks from Wapol in order to defend the honor of Dr. Hiriluk's flag. Luffy's persistent requests for Chopper to join the crew annoyed him greatly, but it also moved him to see that Luffy actually liked him for his transformations, when his whole life they had led to him being cast out and deemed a monster. Chopper deeply cares for Luffy as he will jump in the ocean to save his captain, despite having to be dragged out too since he's a Devil Fruit user.

After the timeskip, Chopper is more willing to beat up Luffy for stupid decision making but still strongly respects him as captain, as seen when he witnessed Luffy defeat and tame Surume. In Punk Hazard, when the kids were drugged by Caesar Clown, Chopper told Luffy the importance of not letting the kids eat the "candy" and Luffy respected his knowledge as a doctor. When Chopper heard of what Luffy wanted to achieve after he became the Pirate King he was simply amazed by the very notion of his captain's dream.[16]

Roronoa Zoro
Outrunning the Aqua Laguna

Chopper also seems to have a close relationship with Zoro, whom Chopper near idol worships because he is "so cool". Much like he does with Luffy and Usopp, they have a very close relationship. During the Long Ring Long Land Arc, Chopper is separated from the crew due to the Straw Hats losing an event and becomes distraught. Zoro yells at him to quit complaining, as being a pirate was his decision, and thus in this world, no one will respect his tears. This strengthens Chopper's resolve as a pirate, and he becomes much less prone to crying and complaining, despite his child-like nature. Zoro taught Chopper that even though every crewmate has separate dreams, they still stick together as a crew and are stronger this way. One of his favorite things to do is to ride on Zoro's shoulders when they are traveling and often runs to him when he is scared. Zoro also seems more protective of Chopper than anyone else. It is seen that Zoro is the one to save him when he comically falls into any form of water when trying to escape Nami's wild mood swings (while Sanji has saved Luffy frequently in comparison), though Chopper still gets annoyed with Zoro whenever he takes off bandages from injuries he sustained from battles or is attempting to train before his injuries have fully healed. However, he does irritate Zoro when Chopper clings to his face to avoid falling into water such as what happened at Water 7 during Aqua Laguna. Chopper is not afraid to argue or wrestle the swordsman and hates it when Zoro shows a lack of care for absent crew members.

After the timeskip, Chopper is more willingly to beat Zoro up for any stupid decision making but still strongly respects his skills as shown when he was awestruck by his vastly improved strength in the fight against Surume.

Nami
Chopper Meets Nami
Chopper meets Nami.

Nami is very fond of Chopper and is the first of the crew to recognize him as a doctor. She respects his knowledge in medicine and cares for his safety as much as her own. Likewise, Chopper respects her ability to navigate; though he tends to be afraid of her obsessive love for money and violent nature towards the "idiots" of the crew so much so that he runs or puts up his Guard Point during these mood swings. The two share a relationship that is much like an older sister's and a younger brother's. Nami will hug onto Chopper's fur for warmth in cold situations or when she is scared. Nami and Chopper are very protective of each other, like when Franky first suggested killing Chopper to end his rampage in his Monster Form Nami threatened to kill him if he did so (though the two did come up with a better plan to save Chopper). In spite of this Nami did hold Chopper up as a shield from a charging Zoro who Nami thought Zoro was going to attack her on Punk Hazard, when in truth, Zoro was trying to protect them from Monet. Nami and Chopper also bonded in sadness over Sanji's exit in Zou and were the first to volunteer to go save him with Luffy.  

When Absalom was stalking Nami, Chopper went out of his way to protect her. Nami also comforted Chopper when he was upset over Hogback's betrayal. Due to his innocence and lack of interest in human females, Nami lets Chopper (despite him being a male) see her naked in the bath and even invites him to join her.

Usopp
Walk Point 17
Chopper and Usopp meet again after 2 years.

Initially, Usopp was terrified at the sight of Chopper but after he learns that Chopper was Luffy's friend, he treats him better especially when the latter joins the crew. Due to his naïve nature, Chopper is a fateful listener to Usopp's lies, most of which he really believes, at least for a short time. Initially bonding with Usopp as one of the weaker members of the crew, Usopp advised him that "you must always still do what you can do for the crew". This includes never running away in certain circumstances, especially when the dreams of your friends aren't being taken seriously. He has taken this advice deeply to heart ever since. In fact, he felt his first validation as a pirate when he decided not to run from Skypiea Priest Gedatsu, and eventually defeated him. When Usopp left the crew, Chopper was one of the most affected crew members, and after Luffy beat Usopp in the duel for the Going Merry, Chopper wanted to go treat his injuries immediately but had to be forcibly stopped by Sanji, who ordered him not to stomp on Usopp's pride by healing him after his defeat (when he already had been given mercy by Luffy). Chopper still gave some medicine for Usopp to use but left him be. Chopper missed Usopp dearly despite Zoro telling him not to mention his name anymore and fell completely for Usopp's "Sogeking" disguise, even asking him for an autograph. After Enies Lobby, when Usopp apologized and rejoined the crew, Chopper burst into happy tears of joy as his friend returned. Chopper, Usopp and Nami were most scared in Thriller Bark, but Chopper was willing to fight off zombies to save Usopp and both of them united to protect Nami from Absalom and Lola.

After the timeskip, Chopper is still in awe of Usopp, as seen in Zou when he hugged Usopp after their reunion.

Sanji
Robin Says Farewell to Chopper and Sanji
Robin says farewell to Chopper and Sanji.

Sanji originally wanted to cook Chopper (along with Luffy who wanted to eat him raw) and jokingly wants him to join as "emergency food supply" in the Drum Island Arc but Sanji also listened with Nami to Chopper's past, learning that humans attacked him for looking like a monster so when Chopper asked Sanji what Luffy "was" Sanji replied with a smile: "He's a monster" showing the doctor that being different didn't mean you couldn't be accepted. Throughout the series, Sanji continues to refer to him as "the emergency food supply" to tease him, but strongly considers Chopper a friend. In fact, due him being the youngest, Sanji cares for him most out of all the males on board the crew. Chopper idolizes the cook for his raw fighting strength and is awed by Sanji's burning rage. Chopper will often hide behind Sanji's leg when Nami's angry or there is an enemy close by, leading to Sanji patting Chopper's head in comforting way and Chopper will sometimes take a ride on the cook's shoulders. Sanji has taught Chopper many lessons like when Robin was leaving the crew Sanji told the doctor that a real man forgives a woman's lies.

Chopper Relieved by Old Sanji
Much to Chopper's relief, Sanji is back to his old usual self towards Shirahoshi.

After the time skip, the pair still get along though Chopper was one of the first people to realize how life-threatening Sanji's nosebleeds were, even begging the fish-men for blood donations. Chopper cried with joy when Sanji saved them from Doflamingo, was highly interested in Sanji's arranged marriage to Pudding, and completely distraught (along with Nami) over Sanji leaving the crew, even yelling at Zoro when the swordsman ridiculed Sanji.

Chopper was so anxious to see Sanji again he mistook Sanji's malicious brother Vinsmoke Yonji for Sanji when he first saw him. Like the rest of the crew, Chopper was shocked when Sanji turned down Pudding.

Nico Robin
Robin dotting on Chopper
Chopper being cheered up by Robin.

He shares a taste for reading with Robin who called him "Doctor-san" when she first joins the crew, which made him dance in joy. They also seem to have a genuine sense of respect for each other, possibly due to their pursuits in knowledge; ironically, he was originally rather intimidated of Robin upon finding out that she specializes in assassinations, fearing that she will one day assassinate him once his guard has been let down, but at the same time, was amused when she first displayed her Devil Fruit powers to entertain both him and Luffy, and eventually opened up to her. His fondness towards Robin is what compelled Chopper to use his Monster Point Form against Kumadori during his battle in the Judiciary Tower. In return, she treats Chopper not only an equal in terms of intellect but also with a motherly nature as she got him out of the clutches of Foxy's right-hand woman.

Franky
Straw Hats Goof Off at Reunion
Chopper and Usopp goof off with Franky.

Though he disliked Franky at first when they officially met at Enies Lobby, blaming him as the reason Usopp left the crew and for beating up the sniper (unaware their new friend Sogeking is Usopp) as well as stealing their treasure. When Chopper was fighting Kumadori he encountered Franky also fighting CP9 agent Fukurou, the Cyborg requested that Chopper throw him some cola, Chopper was reluctant to do so but threw Franky some bottles anyway. Chopper watched in amazement as the Cyborg's hairstyle and attitude changed until Franky yelled at him to stop messing around as he saw that Chopper was enjoying seeing him change with every drink saying, "He's the funniest thing ever". When Chopper went on a rampage in his Monster Point, Franky initially suggested killing him but at Nami's strong urging he changed his decision. Franky instead knocked Chopper into the ocean to deactivate his powers and quickly dived into the water to save him before he drowned. After the conflict, it appears any lingering animosity Chopper possessed towards Franky has ended as he was alright in letting him be a member of the crew.

After Franky's entry into the crew, Chopper is amazed by Franky's inventions (especially the Mini Merry II) and shows great respect for him. He is also in awe of Franky's robotic body, especially after the timeskip. Franky is very much a brother figure towards Chopper and the cyborg will let the doctor ride on his head when they are traveling.

Brook
Brook and Chopper Defend the Sunny
Chopper and Brook defend the Sunny.

When Chopper first met Brook, he was understandably terrified of him because he was a walking and talking skeleton and argued with Usopp that he would not accept him as a crewmate. But after hearing the story about Brook and Laboon, Chopper cried and even stated he was not afraid of skeletons anymore. After Brook's entry into the crew, Chopper and Brook get along very well despite Brook being the oldest Straw Hat and Chopper being the youngest. It is shown Chopper loves the undead skeleton's music and will often dance to it.

After the timeskip, Chopper is not afraid to yell at the undead musician, making Brook scream in a panic, which is ironic considering he has more of a frightening appearance. Brook did get jealous of Chopper and Momonosuke getting special treatment from Nami and was reluctant to play songs when requested but hating to disappoint Chopper and Nami so he played for his friends anyway. When Giolla attacked, Brook feigned allegiance towards her. Chopper was afraid that Brook betrayed them but was relieved when Brook saved them instead.

After Brook was captured by Charlotte Linlin in the Whole Cake Chateau, Chopper was of the few who took part in retrieving him and after doing so, he was amazed that Brook managed to gain copies of the Poneglyphs in Big Mom's possession.

Jinbe
Chopper is shown to be very amazed at Jinbe's strength and was one of the first to encourage Jinbe to join the Straw Hats, commenting that having a former Warlord would be a great asset to the crew. Chopper considers Jinbe to be very cool, having cried in joy seeing how he defied Big Mom.

Family
The Herd
Chopper's biological family is a herd of reindeer, who abandoned him for being different. Initially estranged for being born with his blue nose, he is further abandoned after eating the Hito Hito no Mi, which gave him two "unreindeer-like" humanoid forms. He eventually found his path intertwined with them again during his days with Hiriluk when he was beaten up by them (where his left antler was broken). However, he was able to pass through them despite this and achieve his goal at the time.

Hiriluk
Hiriluk Hugs Chopper
Chopper and Hiriluk's relationship.

Hiriluk was Chopper's mentor who took him in and became his "father". They had a close relationship with each other and had formed a deep bond despite their almost constant arguing with each other and Chopper had a hard time when he was informed of the disease Hiriluk is suffering from. He found Chopper one day while traveling home in a blizzard. At first Chopper tried to knock him away, but Hiriluk earned his trust by stripping naked in the cold, showing that he did not have any weapons or intention of hurting Chopper.

From then on, the two slowly formed a sort of father/son relationship, traveling (and in a way terrorizing) the island trying to cure patients and generally resulting in them having to literally run for their lives from angry patients or their associates. Despite his time spent with the superior Doctor Kureha, Chopper refers to Hiriluk as "the greatest doctor in the world." Hiriluk also gave Chopper his name, claiming his antlers looked like they could chop down trees.

Kureha
“	There's no such thing as a miracle cure! That's why doctors are needed!!! Listen! A kind heart alone won't save lives!!! You have to acquire knowledge and medical skills!!! Without those things, you can't save anyone!!!	”
— Kureha reprimanding Chopper for inadvertently poisoning Hiriluk.[17]

Mondolin Infobox
Chopper takes care of his mentor, Kureha.

Chopper's adoptive mother and mentor in medical science. When she realizes that Hiriluk is dying, she agrees (reluctantly) to his last requests: to make his life's work come to fruition and to train Tony Tony Chopper in medicine. During the time since Hiriluk's death, she trains Chopper in medicine, claiming she taught Chopper "everything she knew", and was fairly impressed by the young reindeer's skill. She only once complimented Chopper's skill in a filler episode, after Chopper cured her of a life-threatening illness without any of Kureha's medical advice. Though neither family nor claiming to have adopted him, Dr. Kureha is his mentor. While she often hides her feelings towards him, she considers him to be her son. She is very happy to know he is currently doing well.

Friends
Drum Island
Back on Drum Island, the people have come to accept his help in defeating Wapol, even though originally, they were afraid of him.

Dalton
Dalton also has a sound view of Chopper, whom he views with the highest respect having saved the kingdom of Drum and was the one who saved his life six years ago by stopping an angry Chopper from fighting a hopeless battle against Wapol and his army to avenge Hiriluk's death, having recognized what he was trying to do. He keeps an eye out for Dr. Kureha's "son" and was the first to tell her when Chopper gained a bounty.

Sodom and Gomorrah
Sodom and Gomorrah have developed a special relationship with the doctor of the Straw Hat crew, since he was the only one who could understand what they were saying and could translate their wishes and feelings to the rest of their comrades. After the battle, Chopper was also the one to treat their serious wounds, for which they were grateful.

Torino Kingdom Citizens
After being "sent" to the Torino Kingdom, Chopper was very distressed as he was treated as a plaything by the birds and hounded by the natives as food. However, after Chopper managed to resolve the conflict between the natives and the birds, he was treated almost like a hero. After receiving Luffy's message he returned and the natives were glad to share their knowledge of herbs, medicines, and plants with Chopper, especially after he helped solve their conflict. The giant birds of Torino Kingdom were also happy to fly Chopper to the Grand Line whenever he wanted to.

Mink Tribe
Due to his group's efforts in saving the Mink Tribe after they were devastated by an attack from Jack, Chopper and his crew are considered as saviors to the minks. Therefore, they formed a harmonic relationship.

Milky
Chopper became highly infatuated with the female reindeer mink, Milky. When she rubbed against his cheek and called him "Doctor Chopper", Chopper fell over dazed in a very Sanji-like manner, complete with love hearts in his eyes, causing Usopp to wonder what had come over the usually platonic Chopper.[13]

Carrot
Chopper and Carrot Traverse the Mirro-World
Chopper and Carrot together in the Mirro-World.

Chopper became well acquainted with Carrot after she joined the 'Sanji Retrieval Team' to Whole Cake Island. They work well together as a team, having helped each other navigate Charlotte Brûlée's Mirro-World and successfully enacting their plan to defeat her. Carrot herself respects Chopper's strategic genius and affectionately refers to him as "Cho-niki" (a portmanteau of Chopper and "brother").

Miyagi and Tristan
Doctor Infobox
Chopper, Miyagi and Tristan working together.

Chopper, Miyagi and Tristan hold a tight professional relationship, with both minks having provided assistance to the Straw Hat doctor's medical endeavors multiple times.

Miyagi holds a profound admiration for Chopper's medical knowledge and skills, being eager to learn more about the reindeer's work and rushing to witness it whenever he has the chance. Tristan, Miyagi's assistant, dutifully follows her superior around, sometimes trying to rein in Miyagi's enthusiasm.

Enemies
Wapol
One of Chopper's major enemies is Wapol, the spoiled king who insulted the death of Chopper's surrogate father, Dr. Hiriluk, among other things. With Luffy’s coming, Chopper not only managed to get revenge for his father but also with Luffy’s aid, they managed to prevent Hiriluk’s flag from being burnt.

Marines
He is wanted by the Marines, albeit with an extremely low bounty of only 1,000 belly due to being mistaken as a pet, and with only one of his transformations noted in the bounty poster.

Hogback
Chopper initially idolized Dr. Hogback solely based on his reputation as a doctor of legendary skills and outright and angrily stood up for him when Nami and Usopp spoke negatively about him based on the suspicious circumstances, despite barely knowing the man personally.

However, after learning of his disregard for human life and that he uses his medical expertise only for fame and wealth while considering his patients as annoyances (as opposed to Chopper's philosophy of a doctor must cure any patient regardless of reward and circumstances), Chopper declared that he no longer considers him a doctor and even tried to smash his head when coming into conflict with him and the rest of Gecko Moria's forces.

Caesar Clown
Chopper Beats Up Caesar
Chopper beats Caesar Clown to a pulp.

Despite not having had a personal encounter with Caesar Clown (until the end of the Punk Hazard Arc), Chopper has quickly grown to despise the mad scientist after discovering the cruel experiments he conducted on the children he kidnapped (similar in a way to Dr. Hogback). Despite this, after saving the children, Chopper's hatred of him seems to have lessened somewhat, willing to heal his wounds after his confrontation with Luffy, even stopping Sanji from kicking him in the face anymore while healing him (but he did give him permission to continue after he was done patching him up). 

Chopper has also shown admiration for Caesar's scientific expertise, if only momentarily, after believing he was the one who was originally responsible for creating SMILEs, even calling him a "genius" (which he enjoyed), but quickly dismisses him after founding out that Vegapunk was the one who really discovered it first. However, upon seeing Caesar's delight at how his Koro gas decimated the Mink Tribe, Chopper finally lost patience with him and beat him up personally, forcing him to make an antidote for the minks while Sanji threatened to destroy Caesar's disembodied heart.

Despite Chopper's dislike of Caesar, the latter was allowed to help the reindeer perfect the Rumble Ball formula, having given Chopper a list of ingredients that could be used to improve the time limit of his Monster Point.

Queen
Chopper stands against Queen's development and weaponization of viral diseases, considering those practices highly dangerous and unethical due to the uncontrollable nature of viruses. The existence of both the Mummy and Ice Oni viruses shocked Chopper, who was able to witness their deadly, cruel effects firsthand. Because of this, Chopper worked hard to develop cures for both diseases.

Chopper Hits Queen
Chopper hits Queen.

Queen underestimated Chopper's ability to cure his viruses, as he viewed the reindeer as nothing more than a lowly ship's doctor. Queen also believed that Chopper was tricking the victims of his Ice Oni disease with the promise of a cure due to his own views of the world of piracy, where lies and treachery run rampant. When Chopper managed to prove him wrong, however, Queen was angered, especially after Chopper started lecturing him about medical ethics. Like many other characters, Queen refers to Chopper as a tanuki. Chopper, predictably angry about this, clarified to Queen that he was in fact, a reindeer, while hitting the All-Star in the face when given the opportunity by Marco.

Even though Chopper kept assaulting him in Monster Point, Queen remained arrogant towards Chopper and admitted that he was not taking the reindeer seriously in battle as he was prepared to finish him off, just before Sanji intervened.

Overview
Typically, it is rare for doctors to fulfill roles other than medical practices for the benefit of those around them, but as the Straw Hat Pirates' doctor, Chopper's responsibilities are not limited to just medicine alone.

He occasionally performed tasks like steering the ship as their unofficial helmsman while on the Going Merry, and during the heat of battle, he can also fulfill the role of a physical fighter to support his friends.

However, due in part to his lack of battle experience or formal training (as well as his Rumble Ball's time limited effect) Chopper was originally considered part of the "Weakling Trio" along with Nami and Usopp.[13] This lay largely in his lack of battle intuition and naïveté at the time, though it is shown that he has gotten much more capable after his two years of training on Torino Kingdom.

In spite of his usual fearful behavior, Chopper is shown to have a strong will as he withstood a burst of Haoshoku Haki from Big Mom.[14]

Tactical Skills
Chopper has a high power of analysis and deduction and can think in how to deal with situations in smart ways. In the Alabasta Arc, during his battle against Mr. 4, Miss Merry Christmas and Lassoo, Chopper understood Mr. 4's abilities and fighting style and how dangerous they are through observation. He even thought of a way to use the battlefield and the opponents' own abilities against them. In the Skypiea Arc, during his fight against Gedatsu, Chopper understood how his opponent's attack Swamp Cloud Burger works and how dangerous it is by watching Gedatsu use it against his own subordinate.

During the Whole Cake Island Arc, Chopper showed again great tactical skills in the middle of his confrontation with Charlotte Brûlée as he and Carrot came up with a method to deceive her by using a decoy of Carrot created by Brûlée's power. He has shown to be very analytical, as he examined his surroundings before taking action. He pretended to remain restrained by chains in his Heavy Point, and when Carrot toppled the soup towards Brûlée and electrocuted most of the enemies, Chopper used the element of surprise by changing into Brain Point to break free before using Monster Point, subjugating the Crocodile homie and wiped out the remaining enemies. Chopper even thought of exploiting Brûlée's Devil Fruit ability to transverse Big Mom's territory through the Mirro-World in order to find and save his friends while remaining undetected by a majority of the Big Mom Pirates. His strategy received praise from Capone Bege, the captain of the Fire Tank Pirates and a master tactician.

During the mission to rescue Brook, Chopper used a skeleton with seaweed for hair to use as a replacement for Brook after they retrieved him from Charlotte Linlin.

Zoolingualism
Because he is originally an animal, Chopper can understand and communicate with other animals, thus allowing him to serve as a translator between animals and humans. This was first seen when Chopper translated Karoo's speech on how he ended frozen in the icy waters of Drum Island next to the Going Merry.[15]

Medical Expertise
Chopper Developing Medicine
Chopper preparing medicine.

Having studied under Dr. Kureha, one of the finest doctors of the medically advanced Drum Kingdom, Chopper himself is an extraordinary doctor with outstanding knowledge of both medicine and medical drugs as well as the preparations of most remedies and ointments that can be made from regular fruits, herbs, roots, and vegetables that can be found and used on most islands. He is also capable of administering surgery and resuscitation. Overall, Chopper can treat even the most brutal injuries.

During the two years he spent self-studying the Torino Tribe's massive collection of books on herbalism in the Torino Kingdom, Chopper's knowledge of pharmacology has immensely increased. In the Torino Kingdom, Chopper self-studied many books of new and highly effective remedies, ointments, unknown herbs with great healing properties and other medicinal drugs that were developed by the inhabitants of the Torino Kingdom which are largely unknown to the rest of the world. With this new understanding of medicinal drugs, combined with the medical skills he had already mastered in the Sakura Kingdom, the scope of Chopper's healing skills as a doctor have become noticeably wider. The greatest example of this is during the Zou Arc, as Chopper, with the assistance of the Mink Tribe's doctors, was able to use all of these skills to treat the gigantic, thousand-year-old elephant Zunesha, whose leg was badly injured by the Beasts Pirates.

Chopper was able to invent his very own drug known as the "Rumble Ball", through 5 years of research, which helps to increase his Devil Fruit's fighting capabilities.[16] In addition, while he was under the apprenticeship of Dr. Kureha, Chopper became aware of the highly addictive drug NHC10 (which only selected scientists in selected countries are allowed to use), and its harmful side effects.[17] He is capable of stabilizing the condition of someone suffering from an overdose of the drug.[18] Chopper also easily created a cure for one of Queen's deadliest viruses, the Mummy virus, doing so in a relatively short amount of time.[19][20] Furthermore, Chopper knows how to engineer viruses of his own, but only with the intent of counteracting other viral diseases.[21] He also created a drug that enables minks to access their Sulong Forms anytime without the need of the full moon.[22]

He has been shown being able to give successful blood transfusions (even between two different species: a human and a fish-man, though human and fish-men do carry the same blood), as he did to save the lives of both Sanji and Luffy, after too much blood loss (even knowing their correct blood type: Luffy's blood type being F (the same as Jinbe's), and Sanji's blood type being S RH- (an unusually rare blood type)).

Techniques
Masui (麻酔, Masui?, literally meaning "Anaesthesia"): Chopper injects a substance, possibly an anesthetic, into the opponent's body making them faint. This was first used on Luffy when he had a hallucination of a tsunami about to hit them while walking to Yuba in the Arabasta Desert,[23] and it was later used in order to stop a group of rampaging giant children on Punk Hazard, with some assistance from the G-5 Marines.[24] In the VIZ manga, this technique is called Sedative.
Chopperphage Infobox
Chopper hits a crowd with Chopperphage Nebulizer.

Chopperphage Nebulizer (チョパファージ霧砲ネブライザー, Chopafāji Neburaizā?, literally meaning "Chopperphage Mist Cannon"): After developing Chopperphage, a countervirus that nullifies the effects of Queen's Ice Oni virus, Chopper fires it into a crowd with a cannon, releasing a mushroom cloud with his face on it. This allows Chopper's virus to be inhaled by those in the vicinity, curing them from the effects of Ice Oni.[21] The term phage is derived from bacteriophage, a type of virus used to treat bacterial infections via phage therapy. A nebulizer is a device used to administer medication in the form of mist.
Video Game Techniques
Art of Compounding (?): Chopper pulls out a bowl to grind up ingredients to make medicine that can heal his allies. Used by Chopper as his Unique Special Action in One Piece: Burning Blood.
Devil Fruit
Further information: Hito Hito no Mi
Heavy Point Post Timeskip
Chopper's human form after the timeskip.

Chopper ate the Hito Hito no Mi, a Zoan-type Devil Fruit that allows him to transform into a human and reindeer-human hybrid at will. It also gave him human level intelligence and the ability to speak human language. It also allows him to walk upright on two legs and hold things in his cloven hoof hands. This power is what allowed Chopper to become a doctor and learn about medicine in the first place, which is impossible for a normal reindeer.

While Chopper is usually seen in his hybrid form, which is a tanuki-like chibi-creature, he would sometimes transform into his human form to try and fit in with humans, often with minimal success due to his full human form looking more like an apeman.

In terms of combat, his full human form is very bulky and strong, and with his humanoid body structure, he can use melee attacks that he cannot use in his true reindeer form, such as punching and kicking.

Rumble Ball
Further information: Rumble Ball
Rumble Ball Infobox
Chopper holding up a Rumble Ball.

In addition to his three forms granted by his Devil Fruit, Chopper has also invented a yellow jawbreaker-like drug called the "Rumble Ball", through his research. This drug has the power to "distort the wavelengths" of the Devil Fruit's transformation, allowing him access to additional transformations. The effect of the drug only lasts for three minutes.

His additional forms are:

Jumping Point: Makes his legs long and agile.
Guard Point: Turns his fur into a protective ball of fluff.
Arm Point: Makes his arms bulky and strong.
Horn Point: Grants him large, powerful antlers.
Due to the risk of this alteration, the Rumble Ball's consumption must be closely monitored, and for this reason Chopper cannot consume more than one every six hours. If he takes a second one, he would gain the extra transformations, but he would not be able to control which of his seven forms he takes when he transforms. And if a third one is taken, Chopper transforms into a massive, super strong monstrosity, known as Monster Point, which causes him to lose his mind and go berserk. This form also requires lethal amounts of energy to keep active, making Chopper a danger to both himself as well as others, friend and foe alike.

After the two-year timeskip, Chopper has developed the ability to access the additional forms at any time and without time limit, without even needing to actually take the Rumble Ball. Furthermore, both his Horn Point and Guard Point have developed considerably; both his Horn Point horns, and his protective Guard Point fluff are much bigger, thicker, and stronger. He has also developed an entirely new transformation known as Kung Fu Point, he is seen being able to perform formidable martial art maneuvers with this new form, melding the advantageous characteristics of Arm Point and Jumping Point.

Additionally, he also developed his Monster Point; he now only needs a single Rumble Ball to enter this form, and he can stay in control of himself, allowing him to fight in his most powerful form for three minutes. How he managed to advance his level with the drug is currently unknown.

Later with Caesar Clown's help, Chopper was able to lengthen the duration time of the Rumble Ball to thirty minutes, allowing him to extend the usage of Monster Point, though it causes Chopper to revert to an infant-like state once the effects wear off.

Physical Abilities
As a reindeer, Chopper was naturally born with high levels of cervid speed and agility. After consuming the Hito Hito no Mi, Chopper gained enhanced human physical potential added to his own. He has extreme levels of superhuman endurance, able to withstand powerful attacks from CP9 operative, Kumadori, and even when badly injured, Chopper could force himself to transform into Monster Point and ultimately survived the immense strain, despite his injuries and fatigue that left him unable to move.

During the two years he spent in Torino Kingdom, Chopper underwent extensively intense physical training to further increase his natural physical strength in his based form, which resulted in vast improvements of his Zoan Devil Fruit enhanced physical abilities whenever he transforms. His Heavy Point is now powerful enough to counter a hammer strike from a energy steroid enhanced Dosun, as well as holding back a door against a group of rampaging gigantified children. His new Kung Fu Point form possesses the extreme punching strength of Arm Point while retaining the immense agility of Jumping Point. His Brain Point, which is his weakest form, is now strong enough to easily carry two large iron balls while running at full speed to escape from a murderous Charlotte Brûlée as well as block a sword strike from Yatappe from beheading Hyogoro, while his strongest form, Monster Point, is now powerful enough to violently thrash Queen, one of the strongest members of the Beast Pirates who possesses an Ancient Zoan Devil Fruit and a bounty of Beli1,320,000,000, with only a slap while also scarring his allies, including the very physically strong, Marco and X Drake.

In addition to the various transformation of his Devil Fruit, Chopper is also a powerful self-taught hand to hand combatant. He is very skilled in boxing and wrestling which he typically combines with the increased physical strength of Heavy Point to defeat numerous enemies with ease. With Kung Fu Point, he can use Kung Fu, which he used to defeat several members of the Ammo Knights, which consist of fish-men who possess ten times the strength of ordinary humans. Due to being a reindeer native to a Winter Island, Chopper can stand on ice without slipping which gives him an advantage in icy environments or on ice generated by Brook's Yomi Yomi no Mi ability as demonstrated when they defended the Thousand Sunny from the Big Mom Pirates.

Other Capabilities
Chopper's immense medical knowledge of the bipedal anatomy has also proved useful when the Straw Hats were trying to bring down Oars, during which time, Chopper formulated several theories on where it was best to target the colossal adversary and finding the giant's weak spot. And while naïve, he can also be quite a capable strategist, best seen in his fights against the Mr. 4 and Miss Merry Christmas pair and Gedatsu.

Chopper has at least some knowledge of carpentry, as he worked on repairing the Thousand Sunny's damage after the escape from Totto Land in Franky's absence.[25]

Past
Chopper Forced To Leave Herd
Chopper is kicked out of his herd.

Chopper was originally a reindeer born 17 years ago on Drum Island, with the slight oddity of a blue nose, which caused other reindeer, even his parents, to treat him as an outcast (always making him follow the herd from far back). When the young reindeer was nine he ate the Hito Hito no Mi, however, his herd and parents ostracized him (and with the increase in intelligence granted by the fruit, he was now acutely aware of it), and he struck out on his own. Unfortunately for Chopper, his attempts at communicating with the humans on Drum Island proved disastrous, with the villagers mistaking him for a Yeti and shooting at him.[13][14]

He was rescued by the quack Dr. Hiriluk, who named him and took him in as his friend and "assistant". Although his deeds were of dubious medical value, Hiriluk became Chopper's role-model. Hiriluk taught Chopper his philosophy on life (that all diseases could be cured) and his strong faith in the Jolly Roger as a symbol of strength against all odds. The two went from house to house, administering their "cures" in a country where all doctors not sanctioned by King Wapol were banned.[15]

A year later, when Hiriluk's health worsened, Chopper was left in the cold again as the old man did not want Chopper to watch him die. Once Chopper found out what had happened, however, he vowed to find a cure for his mentor, his one, and only friend. He soon found the cure he was looking for: an Amiudake, a special kind of mushroom with skull-and-crossbones prominently displayed in the medical book (although unaware of what that sign meant medically due to Hiriluk's praising of pirates and the Jolly Roger). Remembering what he overheard by some villagers that a "certain" type of mushroom can heal every illness, Chopper steals Hiriluk's favorite medical book to find the miracle mushroom. Chopper's arduous journey was a success, even though he risked his life and suffered many injuries, the worst of which occurred when during his journey into the wilderness, in order to get to the mushroom, which was growing atop a treacherous cliff, he had to cross through the territory of his old herd.[16]

Though most of the herd stopped and stared at him with silent scorn, the leader, a vicious older male whose forehead was covered in scars from combat, wanted to kill him for returning after the herd had cast him out. He attacked Chopper in a rage of prejudice and spite, and Chopper was forced to fight back, willing himself to carry on and get the mushroom. Though Chopper knocked the leader aside, the reindeer got up and murderously attacked him from behind. Chopper engaged him in a fierce fight and won, allowing him to claim the Amiudake. However, he barely made it out the fight alive, coming back to Hiriluk very weakened, with a broken left antler, dragging a badly broken left leg, and covered in many bruises and bloodied wounds. Though Chopper made a complete recovery after Hiriluk treated his injuries, and reattaching his snapped antler with a metal brace, it was painful for Hiriluk to see how terribly battered his son had gotten simply for his behalf.[16]

Hiriluk Hugs Chopper
Dr. Hiriluk hugging Chopper after he brought back the Amiudake mushroom.

Hiriluk, overwhelmed with tears of gratitude, ate the mushroom to show his love and appreciation to Chopper, (despite knowing that it would end his life) but Chopper would later find out from Dr. Kureha that he had given Hiriluk a fatal dose of poison, Chopper calls her a liar but she assured him it was truth and further explained being kind was not enough to save lives; you need actual medical skills and training, or you won't be able to save anybody. Chopper realizing what he had done begins to sob uncontrollably as Kureha pity's the foolish reindeer. But Hiriluk was not to live much longer anyway as Kureha surmises that the quack doctor chose Drum Castle to be his grave; Chopper rushes out the door to castle after hearing this.[17] Declaring that he had a wonderful life (in the 4kids dub he declares he is a doctor) and after thanking Chopper, he committed suicide by blowing himself up outside of Drum Castle with a failed potion (before being killed by the poison, for Chopper's sake). Chopper, who had arrived to try and save him, was so upset over Hiriluk's death that and so angry that Wapol was making fun of it that he went completely berserk and tried to attack him, losing all control and running toward Wapol with a terrifying beastly roar. Dalton, who had heard Hiriluk's last words and realized that the monster he called his son was trying to attack Wapol he then stopped him. He then, with tears in his eyes, told him that he apologized for those who mocked Hiriluk's death but that he could not beat Wapol if he could not beat him. Chopper was brought out of his rage and then began to tear up as well at these kind words. He went to Kureha, waving Hiriluk's Jolly Roger outside her house and sobbing heavily, begging her to teach him and vowing that he would become a great doctor.

As for Hiriluk's last wish, Kureha (the last remaining doctor not owned by King Wapol) took Chopper in and taught him "real" medicine for the next 5 years. Chopper worked as hard as he could, in order to become a doctor like his idol, Hiriluk.[18] As Chopper's studies grew, he eventually developed the Rumble Ball which could modify the wavelengths in a Zoan Devil Fruit's transformation abilities, giving him four extra forms. However, during one experiment where he took three Rumble Balls at once, he inadvertently took on an uncontrollable 'monster' form that went on a rampage and nearly wiped out an entire village, though fortunately nobody was killed. Chopper woke up in one of Kureha's hospital beds, bandaged and having no memory of what happened once he had eaten the Rumble Balls. After getting a lecture from Kureha to be more careful and that this form posed a danger to his friends, foes, and even himself, he promised never to unleash his monster form again.[19]

Following the Blackbeard Pirates' attack on Drum Island and Wapol and his forces cowardly fleeing, Chopper and Kureha would take up residence in the abandoned Drum Castle, coming down the mountain occasionally to seek out anyone in need of medical attention (although Kureha demanded extravagant payments for her services).

Arabasta Saga
Drum Island Arc
Tamachibi Knocked Unconscious
Chopper helps Kureha with a patient.


Chopper is first seen following Kureha when she visited Cocoa Weed. She noted inflammation in Tamachibi's limbs and diagnosed a bacterial infection in his bones. With the villagers infuriated by Kureha's exorbitant fee, Chopper prepared to fight them but Kureha told him not to attack. Kureha and Chopper left with the supplies and money back home.[20]

Later, a tired Luffy (from having climbed the mountain) would appear, with Nami and Sanji, outside the castle, while he was looking for a doctor. When he was about to fall, Chopper saves him.[21] Then he took them to Kureha to tell her the situation, where the two doctors analyze the situation of the three strangers, and then take them inside, here Chopper seeing that the antibodies are giving some process, informs Kureha commenting that it could be the Kestia. After a while, he approaches Nami with some cut leaves, where he stands up, scaring him, where Chopper tries to hide, albeit in a bad way. Nami tells him not to try to hide anymore, only making the reindeer street and causing her to be confused as to what he is. After Kureha tells him to shut up, he runs out of the room, only to return when he was being chased by Luffy and Sanji who wanted to eat him, where he transforms into Heavy Pont and beats them both up, where he runs out of the castle in terror.[22] Upon returning, he listens to the conversation as Luffy proposes to Kureha to join the crew, remembering what Hiriluk told him about the pirates, before running again when Luffy and Sanji saw him.

Chopper Meets Nami
Chopper meets Nami.

On the way, he arrives at Nami's room, who was going to close her door, where he tells her not to because she still has a fever, starting a conversation between the two, where Chopper can't hide his embarrassment at Nami's thanks. Nami. She finally asks him if they are pirates, which she confirms, where she asks him if she is interested in pirates, to which he worriedly denies. Nami offers him to come with them, so he can be the doctor to take care of her on the ship without having to stay there for three days. Chopper tells her no, asking if he's not afraid of her for being a strange reindeer, to which she says no. Here he is chased again by Sanji and Luffy.

When he manages to lose them, he sees them trying to close the front door because of the cold, where he, knowing that there was a nest with some birds, tells them to stop. However, the two do not listen to him, so he transforms into Heavy Point, breaking and throwing a railing towards them, and then explaining the situation. He then walks away in sadness after being called a monster by the two pirates, only to be chased by them again, where this time Luffy proposes that he join his crew. Soon, Chopper smelled the arrival of his old nemesis, Wapol.[23]

Chopper and Kureha then head out to confront Wapol, who has come to reclaim his old castle. Here Chopper is amazed at how Luffy attacks Wapol with a springy punch, wondering how he is able to do that.[24] Here Chopper transforms into Heavy Point, deciding to face Wapol and his men to protect Hiriluk's ideals. At that moment, Kuromarimo throws one of his hairballs at Kureha, making Chopper worried, however, Sanji intercepts it with his leg, surprising him. He then sees that Sanji can't get that furball out, so Kuromarimo throws more, where Chopper tries to help him; but, he flees when he finds out from Chess that these spheres are flammable, and he was going to light them. There he decides to face the latter, only to be swallowed by Wapol, but manages to free himself thanks to the help of Luffy and Sanji.[25]

When Wapol gets up, devours his two subordinates, turning into his ultimate form, he then fires a cannonball at Hiriluk's Jolly Roger, insulting her. To which Chopper, angry, pounces on him and decides to attack him, but remembers Hiriluk telling him not to hate humans, so he doesn't and tells Wapol to just leave without having to harm him; where the latter shoots Chopper with cannonballs, leaving him injured. There he witnesses how Luffy defends the flag that he wanted to defend so much.[26]

Chopper witnesses the dialogue between Luffy and Wapol related to him about the flag, and is surprised how Luffy protected that flag despite not knowing whose it was. Where he remembers Hililuk's words, marveling at Luffy and seeing him as a true pirate. When Luffy goads him to do something about it, he decides to fight Chessmarimo, the fusion of Chess and Kuromarimo. As they taunt him that he has no one in the world, Luffy joins him telling him to fight alongside him, to which the reindeer agrees, saying he will defeat his opponent. Here he takes out a Rumble Ball preparing to fight.[27]

Here Chessmarimo shoots two fire arrows at him, but he dodges by transforming into Walk Point, then he transforms into Heavy Point and claims that he is a human reindeer, but Chessmarimo yells that he is the same and that he knows everything about his three mutations, taking out four big hammers, attacking him with one, but Chopper dodges it. He then descends on the opponent transforming into Guard Point, whereupon he absorbs a blow from a hammer. The opponent is amazed, but he says he doesn't care, asking him if he thinks he can beat him just by changing his appearance. Therefore, he attacks him with his hammer, but Chopper changes shape again and destroys one of his weapons easily, where he explains the transformations. Chessmarimo then attacks him with another of his hammers, so Chopper fights back with Arm Point, destroying the weapon in the process. Chessmarimo, already irritated, wants to use his Dobikkuri Marimo, Quatro Axe to finish him off, where he is wounded in the arm. His fight continues where Chopper constantly dodges his attacks, while he was looking for his weak spot. When he finally manages to locate him, he uses Jumping Point and stands in front of him to defeat him with Kokutei Roseo. After that, he watches as Luffy defeats Wapol, sends him away, and saves the kingdom of Drum. [28]

Luffy Tells Chopper to Join
Luffy invites Chopper to join the crew.

However, he sees some people approaching so he tries to hide behind a tree, here he is recognized by Dalton. Right there he was seen by some of the townspeople, who see him and point their weapons at him, but he is defended by Dalton, only to run away when Usopp calls him a monster, whereupon he is chased by Luffy. When it's night, he still hears Luffy tell him to come with him, where Chopper thinks he would like it, but he can't leave. Then he approaches the Straw Hats, who were all gathered there, to tell them that he couldn't join them since he's a totally weird reindeer being like a monster and that even if he wanted to join them, he couldn't since he doesn't consider himself a human but a monster. He finally thanks them and that they can go back, to which Luffy tells him to shut up and come with them, to which Chopper finally agrees.[29]

Soon after, he arrives at Kureha in the infirmary to inform her of his decision to become a pirate and that he wants to leave with Luffy's crew. Kureha yells at him not to be silly, as he can't leave her alone, plus there's no way a reindeer could venture into the sea and it would just end up dead, to which Chopper yells that he doesn't care. Despite that, Kureha still refuses to let him go, so she starts chasing him, throwing many knives at him.[30] Leaving the castle he transforms into Walk Point and hitches onto Kureha's sleigh. Kureha yells at him as he leaves the castle that he is following a crazy fantasy as Hiriluk. Chopper believes that she is wrong because Hiriluk completed his investigation before he died. She then calls the Straw Hats and tells them to come up, whereupon they all go up, while he transports them up the cable car. Despite what she had said, she is beginning to doubt whether Hiriluk's investigation was a success or not. Chopper was given a send-off of gigantic proportions: Kureha had turned the snow into sakura blossoms, the very same that Hiriluk had researched over 30 years that would one day, cure the people of Drum of their "sickness of the heart," where Chopper starts crying.[30]

Toast to Chopper's Joining
The Straw Hats give a toast the newest member of their crew, Chopper.

Arriving at the crew ship, where the crew celebrates their entry. As Vivi tries to warm Karoo up, the latter tries to explain what happened, so Chopper translates what the duck says, surprising Vivi that he can understand animal language. At the end he toasts along with the others for his admission to the crew, preparing to live adventures.[31]

Arabasta Arc
The crew saw a Sea Cat as they neared Arabasta. Starving for food, they try to capture it but Vivi stopped them since it was considered a sacred animal. As they pass through a steam of water from an underwater volcano, Luffy and Usopp caught an okama while fishing. As they waited for his crew to catch up, he entertains them with his Devil Fruit ability to copy other people's appearances, one of which was Vivi's father. When the man's crew caught up, he was revealed to be Mr. 2 Bon Kurei of Baroque Works. Knowing his abilities, they made an 'X' mark on their left arms to know when he was posing as one of them.

The crew landed in Nanohana where they encountered Smoker and Tashigi. A powerful pirate named Portgas D. Ace appears, and is revealed to be Luffy's older brother. Ace fights Smoker while the Straw Hats run for their ship. Ace catches up to them and gave Luffy a Vivre Card before departing. They docked their ship near the once 'green city' of Erumalu where they see the extent of the country's suffering as Vivi explained how Baroque Works was using Dance Powder to cause it. After tackling some of the dangers in the desert, they reach Yuba where they meet Toto, a friend of the royal family. They find out that the Rebel Army has moved out of Yuba and headed to Katorea, and the rebel leader Koza, Toto's son and Vivi's childhood friend, is determined to attack.

The crew travels to the city of Rainbase to take down Crocodile and Baroque Works, but run afoul of Smoker and Tashigi. Luffy, Zoro, Nami, Usopp, and Smoker are trapped by Crocodile. Chopper distracts Crocodile while Sanji frees the rest of the crew, but find themselves trapped yet again. After escaping from Rain Dinners, Usopp and the crew together with Vivi crossed the desert to Alubarna, where the final battle will take place.

Crocodile, however, managed to catch Luffy, beginning the first round of their battle. The crew, excluding Luffy, proceeded to Alubarna. As they reached their destination, they split up to distract the Baroque Works agents to engage their battle separately. At first Chopper was paired with Sanji when the two were pursued by Mr. 4 and Miss Merry Christmas, until Sanji left to check up on Usopp and Chopper had to fight by himself for a short while until Usopp came to assist him. The battle of Usopp and Chopper vs. the Mr. 4 team then begins.

Miss Merry Christmas Grabs Chopper
Miss Merry Christmas attacks Chopper from underground.

Things looked hopeless for Usopp and Chopper as they continued to suffer from every attack that the Mr. 4 team made. When Miss Merry Christmas told them that Luffy is dead, Usopp refused to believe it, claiming that Luffy will become the next Pirate King. When she laughed at this, Usopp told Chopper that a real man never lets his friend's dreams be laughed at and must fight for it no matter what. Albeit severely beaten and bruised, Usopp and Chopper finally defeated the Mr. 4 team.

Later, the Straw Hats hurried to locate the bomb before it went off. Vivi figured out where the bomb was, and had Usopp call the Straw Hats together with a flare. She found it inside of the clock tower, but the Mr. 7 pair of Baroque Works were there. Vivi defeats them but realized the bomb couldn't be stopped so easily. It had a timer, and right before it blew up, Pell showed up and took it into the atmosphere, where he sacrificed himself to save Alubarna.

The Rebel and Royal armies continued to fight even after the bomb went off. It isn't until it rained and Crocodile was revealed to be one behind the drought that they stopped. Tashigi and Smoker both are rewarded for taking on Crocodile, but neither one of them believed it was right since the Straw Hat pirates did all the work. Luffy rescued Nico Robin and Cobra from the collapsing tomb where he fought and defeated Crocodile. He was then brought to the palace to rest. When he awakened, a banquet is thrown for the pirates. They were then invited to enjoy the hot spring steam-room inside the palace.

Straw Hat Friendship X Mark
The crew, with their left arm in the air, bearing the x sign.

Later that night, Mr. 2 Bon Kurei contacts them, telling them he prevented their ship from being taken by the Marines. The next day, the day of her speech, Vivi was to make a decision on whether or not she will stay with the crew. Meanwhile, Bon Kurei and his crew helped the Straw Hats escape from Hina so they could get to Vivi, who declined joining them for the sake of her country. Regardless, they all showed their 'X' mark to signify that they will still consider her as one of them. After escaping from the Marines, Robin (Ms. All Sunday) appeared from inside of the Straw Hats ship. She managed to persuade the crew to let her join since she has nowhere else to go.

Sky Island Saga
Jaya Arc
Nami's Log Pose began to point to the sky, after that, a big ship fell from sky and the crew found a map in of an island named "Skypiea" on a 200-year-old ship. They competed with the monkey-like Masira's salvage crew while they searched for more clues on how to get there. The Straw Hats decided to go to Jaya island to look for information on Skypiea. The Straw Hats met with Mont Blanc Cricket on another part of Jaya; Cricket is a descendant of Mont Blanc Noland, an infamous "liar" who told of a gold city on Jaya, and Cricket was cast out for looking for artifacts of the gold city. He might have be the only person who knows how to get to Skypiea.

Cricket explained how the Straw Hats can ride a dangerous vertical current called the Knock Up Stream to get to Skypiea. However, they first had to catch a South Bird to point them toward the point where the stream will erupt from the ocean. While the Straw Hats were looking for a South Bird, Bellamy and his crew attacked Cricket's house, and stole the gold artifacts he'd collected over the years from his salvage work. When the Straw Hats returned and see what happened, Luffy decided to take a side trip back to Mock Town. The Going Merry is refitted by Masira and Shoujou to be more flight capable, and the Straw Hats catch a ride on the Knock Up Stream for Skypiea.

Skypiea Arc
They started from entering the Gate of Heaven. First they had been recommended by an old woman to pay their extol, but they didn't have to pay the old woman and she let them pass. As they were carried by a sky shrimp, they landed on a place that's surrounded by clouds. There they met Conis, a Skypiean. As their conversation about the waver continued, the White Berets interrupted them and labeled them as a criminal of illegal entrants. As Chopper along with Zoro, Nami, and Robin boarded the ship, the shrimp suddenly carried them, they tried to escape, but that was impossible because of the skyfish behind them. The shrimp left them in the Sacrificial Altar. Zoro, Nami, and Robin explored the land and left Chopper to guard the ship.

As he guarded the ship Shura, one of the priests suddenly appeared to eliminate him. He fought Shura with his ability but found himself no match for the priest. He whistled the whistle to call Gan Fall. As Gan Fall appeared, he fought Shura but in the end, Gan Fall is defeated. Gan Fall fell into the water surrounding the altar and Chopper jumped in to save him but failed due to him not being able to swim. Both Gan Fall and Chopper were saved from drowning by the giant South Birds. Chopper is then told by the birds that Gan Fall is the former god. As the crew reunited, he is seen healing Gan Fall. They spent a night on the ship to regain more energy.

Kokutei Cross
Chopper defeats Gedatsu.

The next morning, Chopper explored the island together with Luffy, Zoro, and Robin to search for the gold, but a giant python named Nola attacked them, causing the group to split up. After finding himself all alone, Chopper was caught in the cross fire between Enel's enforcers and Shandia. Chopper eventually found himself on the Ordeal of Swamp where Gedatsu, one of the priests was. He mustered up his strength and defeated Gedatsu. Confident on being on his own, Chopper proceeded to the Upper Yard, but he encounters Ohm, who defeated him. He later regained consciousness when Luffy finally rang the bell.

Later he was seen joining in the celebration. The next day, the crew has collected a large amount of gold from Nola´s body when a group of Skypieans arrive with Robin bringing a large gold post, but the rest of the Straw Hats mistake it for a large cannon and they start running to their ship. They manage to return to the Blue Sea with the help of Pagaya and Conis.

Water 7 Saga
Long Ring Long Land Arc
Chopper and company came across a mysterious pirate ship after trying to escape a giant wave. Soon, they arrived on an island inhabited by strange animals. The Going Merry was captured by the Foxy Pirates. After Tonjit re-united with his horse, they were attacked by Captain Foxy and his subordinates, who challenged Luffy in a Davy Back Fight, a contest of pirates where the stakes are members of the crew.

The first round of Davy Back Fight involved a race around the island with tiny boats. In the anime, Chopper was teamed up with Zoro, and their boat was eliminated immediately. With only Luffy, Nami, and Porche's boat remaining, it was an all out war to the goal, but after Foxy exposed his Devil Fruit powers, Porche won and took Tony Tony Chopper from the crew.

Chopper as a Foxy Pirate
Chopper as one of the Foxy Pirates.

When Foxy decided to take Chopper after the first round, the "Donut Race," Chopper cried, saying that he only went out to sea because he knew that his crew would be the Straw Hats. Zoro lectured Chopper, telling him that he must be a man and that he is responsible for becoming a pirate.

Then the contest began with the second round. Without Chopper, Sanji and Zoro had to face the Foxy Pirates in a ball game, but were hampered by their blatant cheating and the crooked referee. The bickering rivals Sanji and Zoro managed to overcome the opposing team by working together. Luffy takes Chopper back. (In the anime, Luffy chose Shelly instead of Chopper.)

Luffy and Foxy faced off in the final game: a battle of brawn aboard Foxy's ship. The Straw Hat pirates watched from the side as Luffy continued to battle Foxy with the odds not in his favor, and the fight continued inside Foxy's ship. They had not seen the battle when they fight inside the ship. Luffy managed to finally defeat Foxy by using his own ability against him.

After the Davy Back fight, the Straw Hats met Aokiji, one of the three Marine Admirals. Aokiji helped out Tonjit by freezing a path to the next island. After Tonjit left, Aokiji explained to the Straw Hats some things about Robin's past, such as how each organization she had been with were completely destroyed with Robin being the sole survivor. A confrontation ensued and Aokiji froze Robin. Usopp grabbed the frozen Robin and ran back to the Merry along with Nami and Chopper to unfreeze her. After the ordeal with Aokiji, the Straw Hats continued with their journey in search for a Shipwright.

Water 7 Arc
After the Going Merry narrowly escaped being hit by a "sea train," the crew met an old woman, Kokoro, and her granddaughter, Chimney. Kokoro gave Luffy a map to Water 7. When they arrived there, Chopper had lost Robin when they were out shopping.

Chopper, along Luffy, Sanji and Zoro followed Usopp's bloody trail to the Franky House where they found him passed out in front of the building. The four of them challenged the Franky Family only to find out that their real target, Franky himself, was gone and had taken the money with him.

After an argument between Luffy and Usopp broke down into a fight, ending with Usopp being greatly wounded by Luffy, Chopper attempted to go to his aid. Sanji tried to stop him, though, saying that Usopp asked for the duel, and getting healed by Chopper would only bring him shame. Despite Sanji's request, Chopper went to Usopp, leaving behind medical supplies as he tearfully ran back to ship.

Robin Says Farewell to Chopper and Sanji
Robin's farewell to Sanji and Chopper.

The Straw Hats got themselves a hotel room. An incredibly high tide called the "Aqua Laguna" was coming and Chopper and Sanji rushed to warn Usopp. While the crew hid from angry residents, Sanji and Chopper discovered Robin and she told them what they've feared: she's responsible for Iceburg's assassination attempt and she wanted to part ways. Chopper reunited with the others without Sanji and they discussed what had happened. Luffy decided that in order to know the full truth, they had to catch Robin.

The Straw Hat Pirates and Paulie broke into the room where they found Iceburg and CP9. Luffy and the others requested that Robin comes back to the crew. She refused and told them that she cannot accomplish her "wish" if she were to stay with them. Robin turned to leave and CP9 tried to hold the pirates back. Robin successfully escaped and Lucci showed the remaining his "transformation," a result of his Devil Fruit. He quickly disposed of the crew and CP9 tied up Paulie and Iceburg, leaving them alone as the building burned down around them. Chopper escaped the burning building with Paulie and Iceburg on his back and collapses outside. Nami rushed to tell Chopper so they can could look for the rest of the crew.

Chopper found Zoro and handed him the Sandai Kitetsu so that he could can escape the chimney he got stuck in. Seeing how determined Luffy was to save Robin, Kokoro and Iceburg lend the Straw Hat crew the use of another sea train, Rocketman. The Franky Family showed up, pleading to Luffy to let them join them because they'd do anything for their leader. The Rocketman finally made it out to sea. Paulie told his fellow carpenters who the real culprits were. The Straw Hats, Franky Family, and Galley-La Company then formed an alliance.

They miraculously passed through Aqua Laguna unscathed and the passengers rejoiced. Sanji contacted the rest of the crew and filled them in on his current situation. Back in the Rocketman, Luffy, Zoro, Nami, and Chopper changed their outfits. Those on the Rocketman encountered the discarded train carts and Zoro sliced them so they can pass. Zoro also clashed with "Ship Cutter" T Bone. The fight was short and Zoro joined the crew again in the Rocketman.

Yokozuna the frog jumped onto the front of the train, knocking them from the rails. After Kokoro spoke with him, he joined the group. Luffy and the others finally caught up to Sanji, Usopp (currently disguised as Sogeking), and the rest of the Franky Family as they neared Enies Lobby. Paulie sat down with the group to talk about their plan. Luffy didn't bother to follow the plan, and proceeded to slingshot himself beyond the gates before the train stops.

Enies Lobby Arc
As they proceeded to Enies Lobby, Chopper and crew managed to land on Oimo's back. They rode Sodom and Gommorah to reach the Courthouse. As they waited for the bridge to be activated, the Straw Hat´s lined up at the roof to convince Robin to accept their request saving her. When the bridge was not fully lowered, Kokoro helped by using the Rocketman. The train used the half lowered bridge as a ramp. Luffy his crew down as he jumped onto it.

Monster Chopper Out of Control
Chopper's berserk Monster Point.

After they crash-landed, Fukurou appeared and declared that a key is needed to unlock Robin's cuff. The crew decided to individually search for and fight an agent, leaving Luffy to handle Lucci whom Fukurou said was taking Robin to the Gates of Justice. Later, searching for agent, Chopper found Zoro and Sogeking being chased by Kaku and Jabra cuffed each other. He was sent to search for the number 2 key from the other agents.

He switched with Nami to fight Kumadori. However, he took the Rumble Ball too soon was unable to defeat the CP9 assassin before its effects wore off. His fight with Kumadori was then taken into the kitchen where Franky was battling Fukurou. Chopper managed to stall the fight by locking Kumadori in the refrigerator. When Franky asked him to get him some cola so he could beat Fukurou, Chopper hesitated due to his earlier experience with Franky, but eventually decided to help since they were currently on the same side. After accidentally giving him vegetable juice, then tea, Chopper got the cola Franky needed and watched him blow Fukurou through the wall with a single punch. After watching Franky defeat Fukurou, Chopper found himself fighting Kumadori again after the latter broke out of the refrigerator.

His three basic forms unable to hurt the agent, Chopper thought about taking another Rumble Ball in desperation, but knew that by eating a second Rumble Ball right after the first, it would cause side effects that took away his control over his forms. He eventually gave in and ate the second Rumble Ball, risking the unwanted of shuffling through the wrong forms just so he could access the immense fighting strength of Arm Point, despite the possibility that his erratic transformations would keep him from entering that form before the three-minute effects of the Rumble Ball were used up.

As his transformations did not work properly, he was initially beaten by his opponent, and upon finally transforming into the form he wanted right before the Rumble Ball wore off, his strongest attack in Arm Point only served to make Kumadori angry. Pinned down, helpless, and about to be delivered a mortal blow by Kumadori, Chopper had no options left but to eat one more Rumble Ball and access his forbidden form. After recalling the last time he took three Rumble Balls, he mentally apologized to Dr. Kurhea for being unable to keep his word. Hoping none of his friends would cross his path, he took a third Rumble Ball and took on his Monster Point. In this form, Chopper quickly overwhelmed and even terrified Kumadori, brutally attacking him until he was knocked out. Despite defeating Kumadori, he continued to go on a violent rampage, beating up Kumadori even further and then tearing his way out of the judicial tower with Kumadori in his right hand, who he threw far away into the crowd of World Government and Marines at Enies Lobby, who were shocked to see a top CP9 agent land before them in a bloody pulp. Chopper started scaling the tower and destroying many of its upper rooms, disrupting several fights going on with the rest of the crew and CP9 agents, who were all alarmed at his monstrous form. When Chopper threatened to cause harm to the crew, Franky was forced to shoot him with his Coup de Vent technique, which sent Chopper soaring into the sea in order to stop his Monster Point's violent rampaging and to change him back to normal by forcefully disabling his Devil Fruit powers with their one weakness. Chopper reverted back to his humanoid reindeer form, but did not regain consciousness, and Franky had to retrieve him from the water.

He was later carried away by Kokoro, along with most of the crew, as she swam out of a flooded underground passage in the Bridge of Hesitation while making an escape. Being dragged underwater while out cold, he inhaled too much water and choked in his sleep. When he woke up, he and his crew mates had been saved by Kokoro from drowning, who turned out to be a mermaid. As his crew mates defended their get away ship, he could not move his body because of the side effect of the overuse of the Rumble Ball.

Going Merry's Funeral
The Going Merry's funeral.

With the help of the Going Merry, everyone managed to escape Enies Lobby safely. However, after escaping, Iceburg arrived in a Galley-La company ship in time to pick up the Straw Hat Pirates as the Merry suddenly broke apart. Luffy then gave the Going Merry a viking funeral by burning the ship as the crew tearfully said goodbye.

Two weeks after the events of Enies Lobby, Chopper received his first bounty of Beli50, he was given a low bounty because he was perceived to be the "pet" of the Straw Hats. Chopper was shocked and disappointed that his bounty is so small, since he believed he fought like a man.

When Monkey D. Garp attacked and Usopp tried to rejoin, Chopper was the only one who did not deny his attention. After Usopp apologized for his stubbornness, he was happily accepted back into the crew, and they all sailed off on their new ship to next adventure.

Thriller Bark Saga
Thriller Bark Arc
After sailing for some time on the Thousand Sunny, Chopper and the rest of the crew came across a mysterious barrel floating on the ocean. Upon opening it, a flash shot up from it. After braving a storm that mysteriously came afterwards thanks to Nami and Franky, Chopper and the rest of the crew found themselves in the presence of a ghost ship.

This ship apparently belonged to a skeleton named Brook who initially accepted Luffy's offer to join the crew.[32] Chopper along with Usopp were exceptionally afraid of the skeleton. Just as Brook was about to perform before Usopp and the rest of the crew after dinner, a ghost appeared, and a clanking noise was heard.[33] These sounds were caused by the gates of the island that suddenly appeared, Thriller Bark, closing. This prompted Brook to head to the island before Chopper and the rest of the Straw Hats' eyes.

Mini Merry Goes to Thriller Bark
Nami, Usopp, and Chopper riding the Mini Merry.

With Luffy's resolve to go to the island, to which Chopper could not do anything. With Usopp and Nami, he set out in the new 'mini-merry' ship to explore Thriller Bark. There, the three met the Cerberus, which chased them until they hid in a tree.[34] Here the three met Hildon who decided to take them to met Dr. Hogback. This pleased Chopper as the doctor was renowned in the medical world.

After riding a carriage with Hildon through some woods filled with all sorts of stitched-up creatures, Chopper and his companions were left in the middle of a cemetery. There, they were attacked by some Zombies, and escaped into Hogback's mansion and met with the good doctor and his maid, Victoria Cindry. Over dinner, Chopper asked for the doctor's autograph and a chance to visit his laboratory. The former request was given to Chopper but the latter was not.

After dinner with the good doctor in which the three asked about Brook, Nami decided to take a bath. For this, Chopper and Usopp were put in charge of guarding her from intruders from the outside. In the middle of the bath however, Nami was attacked by an invisible thing. Luckily, Usopp and Chopper came in the bathroom and drove it away.[35] Later after the incident in the bathroom, Chopper and his companions found out that the paintings and taxidermy in the dining room were all Zombies. Fortunately, the three escaped through a secret door before the Zombies could catch them.

Beyond the secret door, Chopper and his companions found themselves in a room filled with Cindry's pictures. Through a newspaper article that Nami found, the three learned that Cindry was an actress that died ten years ago. As they were about to leave, the three stumbled across a treasure chest. Inside however, was a horrific Jack in a box that frightened the three out of the room.

As the three were running through the hallways of the mansion from more painting Zombies, a mysterious bodyguard decided to chase them.

Eventually, Chopper along with Usopp and Nami hid inside the stuffed body of Kumashi to overhear Moria's plan for creating Oars, the strongest zombie. Eventually the trio were discovered and made a run for it, but were surrounded and attacked by a large group of Zombies. During the battle, Nami was captured by Absalom. Franky and Robin arrived just in time to finish off the zombies. After that the crew made its way back to the Thousand Sunny where they found Luffy, Zoro, and Sanji. After explaining the situation to them, Luffy ordered the Straw Hats to prepare for a counterattack on Thriller Bark.

When Robin and Chopper attacked Hogback in his laboratory, they found him protected by Jigoro, Inuppe, and Cindry. Chopper and Robin fought them, but were eventually forced into submission. Chopper announced his disgust and defiance by declaring Hogback was no longer a doctor to him. He explained that when Hogback told him he was using the zombies to investigate the difference between life and death, he admired him because he could help those who lost loved ones when death occurred, but when he found out his role in the zombies' resurrection, he was disgusted that he would go as far as to use them for personal benefit instead medical science, and is forcefully moving them despite their hearts not beating, making them puppets. This, Chopper explained is why he cannot accept the zombies as living creatures, and Hogback as a doctor.

Hogback laughed and insulted Chopper's ideals, declaring he brought new life to the zombies and they should be grateful for "reviving" them. He demonstrated their proof of being "alive" by kicking Cindry in the face and ordering her to lick the ground. He explained that the room that Chopper went into earlier was his room, and told him how he disappeared, and the truth behind Victoria Cindry and her death.

He explained that because of his medical genius, many flocked to him with the hopes he could help them or their loved ones. Eventually, he could not be bothered with that, and explained it was only for the money. Then, a beautiful and famous entertainer named Victoria Cindry became one of Hogback's patients. Hogback, like many other men, was smitten by her beauty and fell in love with her, but she told him she was already engaged. However, it was nothing compared to his eventual heartbreak when he found out Cindry lost her life when she fell from a stage. A depressed Hogback left his job and disappeared from public knowledge, but was discovered by Moria and became in his servitude in the promise that Cindry be brought to life.

Eventually, he stole Cindry's corpse and with medical surgery and Gecko Moria's Kage Kage no Mi ability, Cindry was brought back to life as a Zombie. Hogback declared although Cindry had a different personality, he cared only for her beauty and said she is and should be thankful for her resurrection, and thus ordered her to attack Chopper.

Chopper Restrains Cindry
Chopper Restrains Cindry.

While Chopper refused to attack her, and merely restraining her, as she continued to assault him. Chopper pleaded to Cindry to stop and look at what she's become. While she calms down, Chopper asks to Robin to use her powers and feed her salt. However, she was prevented from doing so by Jigoro and Inuppe under Hogback's orders. Later, it soon became apparent that the two zombies could not get along and began to fight each other, just like Zoro and Sanji so Robin took advantage of Hogback's orders by forcefully closing his mouth, asking him to order herself and Chopper to "jump off the tower." When Robin released Hogback, he indeed did give this order, but it was mistakenly given to Jigoro and Inuppe and they followed suit.

Chopper decided to pummel Hogback, as the mad scientist desperately gave orders to Cindry to buy him time, but she miraculously started crying, and said she could not move. Just as the battle was turning in the Straw Hats' favor, with Chopper with Robin's help about to deliver the final move on Hogback, Oars demolished the wall and interrupted the fight. As Hogback pleaded for Cindry's help, she simply smiled, implying her soul temporarily returned to her, and leaves him and herself to their fate. Oars' rampage apparently lead him to crush both Hogback and Cindry.

Chopper joined the crew's battle against Oars, and although the battle was completely drastic, it became increasingly desperate when Moria used his ability to manipulate Oars' body, giving him an ability to stretch like his counterpart, Luffy. Despite to Oars' immunity to pain, Chopper discover that his weak spot is his right arm. It was discovered that Oars suffered a severe case of frostbite, due to wandering the Land of Ice with very little clothes on.

Armée de L'Air Kokutei Roseo Shoot
Chopper further damages Oars' injured right arm using "Roseo Shot".

Chopper, Sanji, and Zoro continued their attacks towards Oars' right arm, taking advantage of Oars' inability to feel pain, and giving his right arm considerable damage (though not initially noticed by Oars); however, Chopper and Sanji were knocked out for these efforts. With the Straw Hats falling one by one, Luffy returned to save Nami and Usopp and with 100 shadows in him, Luffy strength had multiplied several times over becoming "Nightmare Luffy" and began pummeling the zombie giant, beating him severely, with Moria himself caught in the attack, before powering down.

Down, but far from out, Oars got up to do battle again. Fortunately, Nightmare Luffy's attack was more than enough time for the Straw Hats to recover. Luffy himself surprisingly got up despite having the exhausting process of 100 shadows in his body for ten minutes. Chopper concocted a plan to force Oars' back straightened to take the full force of Luffy's attack. With his arm broken, Oars could not counter as Luffy activates Gear 3 smashing a Gomu Gomu no Gigant Bazooka to his face, breaking Oars' back.

However, Moria returned to consciousness, and used his ultimate technique Shadows Asgard, taking in all shadows in Thriller Bark, numbering to 1000 to finish off the Straw Hats once and for all. However, as Chopper witnessed, Luffy activated both Gear 2 and Gear 3 at the same time, and finally defeated Gecko Moria, releasing all the shadows. Nami then remembered Kuma is on this island and tells everyone.

Meanwhile, Kuma reported that Moria had failed to kill Luffy and is badly wounded, he was ordered to kill everyone on Thriller Bark and evacuate the wounded Moria. However, instead of outright killing everyone as his orders said he offered everyone a deal- let him kill Luffy (who cannot fight back now) and he would leave everyone alone. The Straw Hats and everyone else on the island told Kuma "no way" and he set off a bomb made out of air that knocked everybody unconscious.

However, before he could finish off Luffy, Zoro rose again and vowed he will not let Kuma touch him, Kuma offered to just kill Zoro then and attacks him, though Zoro survived. Zoro offered his head for Luffy's and Kuma decided to torture Zoro by giving him all the pain and suffering Luffy had endured during the battle. Kuma then left, praising Luffy for having such good friends.

Soon after, Chopper joined everyone in a celebratory party at Thriller Bark (save for Zoro, who was still recovering from his wounds) lead by Brook and his piano. Luffy finally revealed to Brook that he is friends with Brook's friend, Laboon. Brook stopped partying, cried, and revealed a Tone Dial which contained the last song the Rumbar Pirates ever performed together on it. Brook stated that since he has found new friends in Luffy and the others, he no longer needed the Dial and would give it to Laboon the next time they meet. Brook then asked if the Straw Hat crew invite is still good and Luffy says it is, Chopper joins the others in a shocked response.

Once he and the rest of the crew finally left Thriller Bark, they held a toast to Brook, their new crewmate.

Summit War Saga
Sabaody Archipelago Arc
After leaving Thriller Bark, Chopper assisted the other Straw Hats on their continued journey. He helped with the battle against Flying Fish Riders alongside the crew.

Afterwards, he arrived in the Sabaody Archipelago, where he joined in the initial group heading out on the island. He was treated to cotton candy by barmaid Shakuyaku and eventually dozed off alongside Brook after trying and failing to find the assisting Camie. Usopp later found him and Brook and was berated for relaxing instead of looking for Camie, and they were quickly taken aboard a Flying Fish with the Rosy Life Riders.

After they entered the Human Auctioning House, Camie had already been sold to World Noble Saint Charlos in an extravagant bid of Beli500,000,000. However, Luffy's Flying Fish burst in, and he quickly got off to rescue Camie. In former enemy Hatchan's attempt to restrain him, he inadvertently revealed he is a fish-man and was shot by Charlos Sei. An enraged Luffy responded by punching him in the face, and started an incident attracting several Marines to the Human Auctioning House. Luffy, along with his and the crews of two of the Eleven Supernovas, Eustass Kid and Trafalgar Law cleared the incoming masses of Marines, Chopper assisted them in battle, until he as well as the rest of the Straw Hats with the help of Duval's Rosy Life Riders, managed to escape.

Monster Chopper vs
Monster Chopper vs. Sentomaru.

Chopper heard Rayleigh's story with the others, but shortly after leaving, he and the others were confronted by a Pacifista. Chopper's Kokutei Roseo Metel attack did very little damage to the weapon's defenses, but the group managed to defeat it by combining their efforts. Unfortunately, they were soon confronted by a second Pacifista and Sentomaru, Dr. Vegapunk's bodyguard. Luffy ordered the crew to split up, and Chopper went with Luffy and Robin. Sentomaru intercepted Luffy and managed to wound him with unarmed attacks despite his rubber body.

Seeing his companions defeated, Chopper became desperate and used three Rumble Balls at once, although he had already used one against the marines outside the Human Auctioning House and another against the Pacifista, it transformed him into Monster Point. Monster Chopper then began attacking Sentomaru as Robin fled with Luffy. He turned his attention to Kuma who just had appeared and was vanished as a result.

Chopper's Reaction to Luffy's News
Chopper's reaction to Luffy's News.

After some time on the island, Chopper managed to stop the war between the humans and birds, using his ability to talk to animals to translate for the natives. Afterwards, he left the island worried and wanting to heal Luffy's wounds after learning of his involvement in the war and Ace's death. He flew off the island on one of the birds, though at the same time a News Ku passed by, and after reading the paper Chopper was shocked by a recent article involving Luffy.

He stated that he understood why Luffy was praying at Marineford, and afterwards, he returned to the Torino Kingdom to become stronger. Since Chopper is uncomfortable with returning to the island sooner than expected, he wore a disguise called "Chopper Mask". However, the natives instantly recognized Chopper and the reindeer then threw away the disguise.

Chopper said that he wants to study the plants on the island and a native took him to the village library where he could do his research. Chopper then commented that the natives are not as primitive as he originally thought as he recalls them using mechanical weapons. Chopper then thought back to his early days, where he was called a monster and shunned by everyone. He realized that ever since he joined Luffy's crew, it did not matter what other people called him, and he promised to help Luffy no matter what.

The story continues two years later.

ish-Man Island Saga
Return to Sabaody Arc
After two years, Chopper returned to Sabaody Archipelago. He was following Fake Zoro, Fake Sanji, Fake Robin, and his own counterpart, believing them (excluding Fake Chopper) to be the real ones. After Fake Robin tried to lure Chopper to them with a cucumber, Chopper then witnessed the fake Robin getting kidnapped by some mysterious men.[13] Later when he saw the Fake Straw Hat Crew, he was disappointed in his "captain" because they were not going to save "Robin", and he left crying and saying that he would save her himself.[14]

Walk Point 17
Chopper meets Usopp again.

While searching for "Robin", Chopper ran into Usopp and Nami, who were very happy to see him. After he was informed that the Straw Hats he encountered were fakes, he returned to the Thousand Sunny with Usopp and Nami. Franky then amazed Chopper and Usopp with his new upgrades. Chopper got excited wondering what Franky's new weapons are. He was pleasantly surprised when he heard from Rayleigh that Luffy was already in the archipelago.[15]

After arriving at Grove #42, Chopper departed atop one of his enormous bird friends from Torino Kingdom to bring Luffy, Zoro, and Sanji back to the Thousand Sunny. With the assistance of the Straw Hats' new allies, Chopper and the rest of the crew descended into the ocean with their coated ship, finally resuming their adventure after two years.[16]

Fish-Man Island Arc
Undersea Voyage
Coating Infobox
The Straw Hats descend to Fish-Man Island.

While sailing under the ocean, Chopper and the crew marveled at the site of the underwater world. He and Usopp also had to keep Luffy and Zoro from doing anything that might endanger the crew. He attended to Sanji after he received a massive nosebleed. Chopper along with the rest of the crew decided to have lunch, while Franky explained how their ship was in one piece after two years thanks to Bartholomew Kuma. As the ship descended even deeper, the crew marveled at how dark it had become. With their seacow, the Caribou Pirates soon caught up with the Straw Hats and prepared for battle.[17] Caribou jumped onto the Thousand Sunny, but before his crew could follow, Momoo fled in fear from seeing Nami, Sanji and Luffy, leaving Caribou behind. The Straw Hats then tied up Caribou as he begged for mercy. He claimed that he was an unfortunate victim and not a pirate, and Chopper believed him until Usopp pointed out that he was lying.

Chopper then attended to Sanji as he experienced another massive nosebleed, suggesting that they try to rehabilitate Sanji. He listened as Nami, with the help of Brook, Franky, and Robin, explained about the Sea Currents, but quickly lost interest when Nami started talking about how salinity affected them.

He reacted with shock when he saw the Kraken.[18] He then screamed in terror when he witnessed the Kraken destroying Caribou's ship. Even though the Monster Trio left the ship using Flutter Kick Coating to fight the Kraken, the sea monster aimed for the Thousand Sunny. Franky used his rocket launcher to repel one of the tentacles which amazed Chopper, Usopp, and Luffy.

New Guard Point
Chopper saves the Straw Hats with his New Guard Point.

Chopper then blocked another tentacle with his new and improved Guard Point. When Luffy hit the Kraken with Gomu Gomu no Elephant Gun, Chopper spotted a shark freed. Because they were not wearing life-lines, the Monster Trio got separated from the rest of the Straw Hats as the ship went down the underwater current.[19]

When the crew reached the "Underworld of the Sea", Chopper immediately started to look for the missing Monster Trio along with Usopp and Brook. He then noticed the gargantuan size of a school of jellyfish that were floating around the ship. One of the jellyfish put one of its tentacles through the bubble coating. Chopper reached out to touch it but Robin stopped him, saying it was probably poisonous, much to Chopper's stunned surprise. When an even larger fish ate the jellyfish that he almost touched, it died as a result, confirming to Chopper that Robin's theory about the jellyfish probably being poisonous was correct. The reindeer commented on how scary and dark the Deep Sea is and how the fish in it cannot see too well.

When the crew realized Caribou was gone, Chopper thought one explanation was that he was thrown overboard while going through the downward current. Chopper was scared when Nami suggested that Caribou might still be hiding on the ship. After Franky trapped Caribou in the barrel, Chopper was the first to notice a sudden rise in temperature. He then moaned about how hot it is, saying he could not go on living this way, and how after waiting two years to see Luffy, Zoro, and Sanji, they disappeared. When the ship was about to be eaten by a gigantic angler fish, Chopper foamed at the mouth in shock.

When Wadatsumi and the Flying Dutchman appeared, Chopper started to cry from sheer terror. He and Usopp were shocked by Brook's frightened reaction to the ghost ship. He was shocked to see Surume suddenly show up and knock out Wadatsumi, and overjoyed that the Monster Trio came back safely. When they were on board, Chopper tackled Luffy, telling him how scared he was.[20]

When the underwater volcano started to erupt, Chopper panicked and was thrown back by the rest of the crew. Chopper exclaimed how hot it was when Nami said the water temperature was rising. When Sanji suffered a nosebleed while talking to Nami, Chopper remarked that it was a bad time to have a guilty conscience. When the crew reached the trench, Chopper noticed how the water was making steam from the heat. When the rocks fell into the trench, he marveled at Usopp's new attack. When a stray rock hit Surume, Chopper fell with the rest of the crew to the bottom of the sea.

Upon finally reaching Fish-Man Island, Sanji suffered another nosebleed thinking about mermaids. Chopper told him that it would be best if he did not see any actual mermaids, as doing so could kill him. He was impressed with Sanji's fiery resolve to die while seeing mermaids. When Hammond approached with his group of Sea Beasts, Chopper is shocked by their gargantuan size. Hammond gave the crew two options: join the New Fish-Man Pirates or die. Chopper and the rest of the crew then prepared to enter Fish-Man Island with a Coup de Burst.[21]

Trouble in the Underwater Paradise
Luffy rejected Hammond's offer of joining the New Fish-Man Pirates and the fish-man prepared to attack. Franky activated Coup de Burst and the ship flew through the bubble surrounding Fish-Man Island. The ship then fell into a current and the crew got separated. Chopper, Luffy, Sanji, and Usopp were seen again in Camie's house meeting and getting reacquainted with Camie. Camie introduced them to some of her friends, the Medaka Mermaid Quintuplets, and took them to Mermaid Cove where they met more mermaids.[22]

As Sanji swam with the mermaids, Luffy, Usopp, and Chopper relaxed. Chopper expressed his surprise that Sanji is back to his normal self, wondering if it was in the chef's nature. He also said that he is glad that Sanji was feeling better, as he had run out of Sanji's blood-type in his blood stock. Chopper states that Sanji has a rare blood-type and that he would not be able to treat any more nosebleeds. While Camie was telling Luffy that Jinbe is not present on Fish-Man Island, Chopper was shocked when a sea serpent appeared behind Usopp. When the Medaka Mermaid Quintuplets informed them that a royal gondola was approaching, Chopper, Luffy, and Usopp hid behind cover while Sanji was being covered by a mermaid. The three brothers of the Neptune House appeared, searching for the people who entered Fish-Man Island illegally. The mermaids denied that they had seen any intruders.

As the three brothers are leaving, Sanji suffered his worst nosebleed to date, forcing the Straw Hats to reveal themselves. As the Ammo Knights started advancing, Chopper pleaded for them to stop and help Sanji, asking if anyone could donate blood. He explained that if they did not get blood for Sanji, he would die in half an hour. Chopper asked if there is anyone who has a blood type of S RH-, going on to say that it is extremely rare. Camie told Chopper that fish-men and merfolk have the same blood as humans and it is transferable. She was about to explain further, but Hammond interrupted her, continuing her explanation. He explained that there has been a rule in place for a long time stating it is forbidden for humans and fish-men to share blood. He went on to say how Fisher Tiger supposedly died. After a gruesome battle, Fisher Tiger suffered a critical blood lost and could have been saved with a blood transfusion, but humans refused to help him. Hammond added that the rule was put in place by humans ages ago so that their bloodline would not mix with "monsters."

Hammond and his group attempted to capture the four Straw Hats, but Luffy repelled them. When a Sea Beast tried to attack Luffy, the Straw Hat captain subdued it with Haoshoku Haki, and Chopper and Usopp were shocked by how the monster acknowledged its loss without actually fighting. Camie stole the royal gondola and helped the four Straw Hats escape. After Usopp noticed Sanji's smirk and Chopper yelled at Sanji not to think about anything as every second matters, Camie then took the group to Coral Hill.[23]

At the port town, Camie and the four pirates found shelter in Madam Shyarly's Mermaid Cafe. Madam Shyarly provided them a room where they could treat Sanji with blood donated by Splash and Splatter, two okama pirates found at a nearby bar. Chopper checked Luffy's blood, saw that Luffy got poisoned by the octopus merman, and was amazed that Luffy's body was able to fight against it. Chopper stayed with Sanji to ensure his recovery while Luffy, Usopp, and Camie went out to see Pappag.[24]

Chopper Uses Kung-Fu Point
Chopper using his Kung-Fu Point.

When the Ammo Knights tried to arrest him and Sanji because of Madam Shyarly's premonition, the false accusation for mermaid kidnappings, and some of the Straw Hats taking over Ryugu Palace, Chopper used his new Kung Fu Point to fight them off, something that the soldiers and citizens thought was a weird animal. Having slightly recovered, Sanji told Chopper that he was going to see the Mermaid Princess, even if it would cost him his life. Chopper scolded him, telling him that if she was beautiful, Sanji might die instantly.[25]

Sanji then defeated the rest of the Ammo Knights and expressed his disappointment of having to give up his chance of going to Ryugu Palace since they were trying to handcuff him. Chopper scolded Sanji for overdoing things, but Sanji snapped back saying what is done is done. Sanji then complimented him on his Kung Fu Point, and the reindeer happily danced while claiming not to be happy about that compliment. When they heard people screaming that a bloodied person was found and needed a doctor, Chopper turned to their direction and said that he is a doctor. Chopper and Sanji then found a wounded Hatchan, who warned them of an impending attack by the New Fish-Man Pirates.[26]

As Chopper tended to Hatchan's wounds, he and Sanji were met with accusations from the Fish-Man Island citizens. While hovering above Coral Hill on top of Megalo, Luffy saw them and jumped down to meet them. Megalo, who was holding Princess Shirahoshi in his mouth, reached his limit and spat her out. While the Fish-Man Island citizens instantly concluded this as a Mermaid Princess kidnapping, Chopper yelled at Sanji not to turn around or else he might die from another nosebleed.[27]

For the sake of his dream, Sanji decided to turn around even if it meant death, much to Chopper's horror. However, instead of getting a nosebleed, Sanji became petrified. Chopper said that it must have been the effects of the okama blood transfer. The citizens then tied up Chopper and the group, but were interrupted by the arrival of Vander Decken IX. After Luffy pummeled Decken into the ground, he checked on Sanji. Chopper informed him that Sanji had reverted to his normal state. The princess and the entire group then hopped on Megalo and flew away. After Luffy knocked back Wadatsumi, the entire group headed for the Sea Forest.[28]

Chopper Relieved by Old Sanji
Much to Chopper's relief, Sanji is back to his old usual self towards Shirahoshi.

After reaching the Sea Forest, Chopper decided it was safe for him to take his time to treat Hatchan's wounds. The group then got acquainted with Franky, Den, and Jinbe. Chopper then told Franky that he was going to lower Hatchan down from Megalo, and he should be ready to grab him. After Hatchan was lowered, Chopper was surprised to see that Sanji is acting like his old usual self in front of Shirahoshi. Nami and Camie soon arrived and Chopper happily realized that Sanji is finally cured of his nosebleed tendencies.[29] Chopper made medicine and listened to Jinbe as he explained the dark past of the fish-men and merfolk as well as the ideals of Queen Otohime and Fisher Tiger.[30]

After Jinbe finished his story, Chopper and Nami had a friendly conversation with Princess Shirahoshi. When Hatchan started explaining Hody's plan, a large Visual Den Den Mushi appeared and the group watches a broadcast by Hody himself.[31] Hody explained his plan of recreating the Ryugu Kingdom with himself as the ruler and then addressed the Straw Hat Pirates. Once he showed the imprisoned Zoro, Usopp, and Brook, Chopper was shocked. After Hody finished his speech, Luffy resolved to fight him. However, Jinbe told him not to. Chopper and Franky then correctly guessed that it was because they are humans.[32] Chopper then watched Luffy and Jinbe trying to settle their dispute on how to deal with Hody.[33]

Battle for Fish-Man Island
Straw Hats and Allies Confront the New Fish-Man Pirates
Jinbe, Shirahoshi, and the Straw Hats confronting the New Fish-Man Pirates at Gyoncorde Plaza.

Chopper later appeared in Gyoncorde Plaza with the rest of the Straw Hats preparing to fight against the New Fish-Man Pirates.[34] When Franky mentioned a new weapon in the Soldier Dock System,[35] Chopper got on board along with Usopp, Nami, and Pappag. He kept asking Usopp if he could drive it. He then rode out on the Brachio Tank V, calling himself "Commander Chopper."[36]

When the Brachio Tank IV fell in a pitfall created by Daruma, Chopper was thrown out with the others by Franky. He then went underground, using his new Horn Point and hindered Daruma in making more pitfalls. He launched him back to the surface and when arrived there, Luffy mistook his new form for a stag beetle. Chopper then faced off against Daruma.[37] Everyone panicked when they saw Noah bearing down on Fish-Man Island.[38]

Chopper was underground with Daruma when Usopp called out for him. Dosun got behind Usopp and tried to take him by surprise, but Chopper intervened using Horn Canon: Elf to push Dosun back. While Usopp prepared to fight Daruma, Chopper prepared to fight Dosun.[39]

Heavy Gong vs T-Shot
Chopper countering Dosun's hammer.

Later, Chopper commented on the new attack from General Franky, but was shocked to see that Franky was the attacker instead of the robot. Dosun tried to take advantage of this distraction, but Chopper transformed into his new Heavy Point and matched Dosun's T-Shot with a Heavy Gong. As Chopper recoiled from the force of the attack, Zoro commented on the new monstrous appearance of the transformation, which Chopper willingly accepted.[40]

Later, Chopper rampaged in his Monster Point, much to Usopp's surprise. Usopp nervously told Chopper that the situation was not that serious for him to go like that. Then, Chopper turned to him and said that he was alright, meaning that Chopper was in fact still conscious.[41]

Chopper Defeats Dosun
Chopper defeating Dosun.

After explaining to Usopp that he can use one Rumble Ball to stay in Monster Point for three minutes, he turned back to Dosun and easily knocked out the fish-man with his Kokutei Parmei attack.[42] After all the leaders of the New Fish-Man Pirates had been defeated, the Straw Hats looked into the sky as Luffy tried to destroy Noah. When the Sea Kings appeared and stopped Noah from falling, saving the ship and the island at the same time, everyone on Fish-Man Island celebrated.[43]

The After Battle Celebration and Departure
Moments later Shirahoshi brought Luffy to the plaza, dismayed to inform everyone that Luffy had lost a lot of blood. Chopper then asked the citizens if any of them had type F blood. He recalled the law prohibiting fish-man-human blood transfusions, but Jinbe stepped up and volunteered to donate blood, saying that he does not need to follow the law, since he is a pirate. Chopper carried out the procedure.

Luffy invited Jinbe to join the crew,[44] but Jinbe declined, saying that he has some unfinished business. Chopper and the rest of the crew informed Jinbe he is welcome to join whenever he is ready.

Neptune invited the crew to a banquet and the crew partied at Ryugu Palace with the royal family.[45] After partying for a while, Chopper was enjoying himself, when Jinbe recounted the conflict between Aokiji and Akainu. Chopper proudly stated he had already heard about it. He then expressed dismay at the statement that the Blackbeard Pirates are hunting strong Devil Fruit users. He believed that he would be a target, but Usopp pointed out that they would not need the Hito Hito no Mi.[46] After the party ended, Chopper was talking with Usopp about the treasure stolen by Caribou that Luffy, Zoro, and Sanji went to collect. He suggested they help them search and was surprised about how high Caribou's bounty is.[47] Chopper and the rest of the crew were later shocked that Luffy challenged Big Mom.[48]

Afterwards, Chopper and the rest of the crew bid the citizens of Fish-Man Island farewell and promised (except Franky and Zoro) Shirahoshi to take her to the surface someday. The crew began to set sail with the Thousand Sunny and head towards the New World.[49]

On their way to New World, Nami put Chopper to guard while she took a shower using her Shower Tempo. Chopper remarked how the Shower Tempo clouds look sweet and yummy like cotton candy and showed his concern if the crew would be alright with Nami not on the deck. After the crew reached the New World, Chopper commented on how the sea of New World looks red.[50]

Dressrosa Saga
Punk Hazard Arc
Arrival at Punk Hazard
Soon after entering the New World, the crew spotted an island surrounded by a sea of flames. The Straw Hats received a distress call from someone who seemed to be in trouble and mentioned something about a samurai. After Luffy decided to go rescue the person, Chopper expressed relief that he was not one of those chosen to accompany Luffy on his exploration mission, stating that he is not good with heat.[51]

Sanji Finds Crew Knocked Out
Sanji finds Chopper and the remaining crew knocked out by sleeping gas.

While Usopp, Robin, Luffy, and Zoro fought a dragon, Chopper and other Straw Hats that remained on the Thousand Sunny were knocked out by sleeping gas and all, except for Brook, were abducted. The captured Straw Hats later woke up in a cell and found parts of a samurai's still-living head. After putting the pieces of the head back together, the group got information from Kin'emon. Once they decided to break out, Franky used his Radical Beam to blast a hole in the wall, allowing the crew to escape. They ran down through the halls of the complex and stumbled upon a room filled with giant children. The children were excited to see them, but Sanji just wanted to escape the room before they are recaptured.[52]

While their pursuers came after them, the children begged the pirates to help them escape. Nami could not ignore their cries and decided to help them. Sanji, Franky, and Chopper attacked the men in the gas masks. Nami and Chopper ran away with the children while Sanji and Franky held the enemy back. Since he was entrusted with protecting the children, Chopper was determined to live up to Sanji and Franky's expectations. As they ran, the children told Nami and Chopper about how they were abducted and that they were inflicted with some kind of disease. Nami was suspicious and told Chopper to investigate the children later. They then ran into a room with corpses frozen in the walls, floor, and ceiling.[53]

Straw Hat Body Switch
Chopper (in Sanji's body) gratefully accepts the headbands Usopp made to identify the scrambled crewmembers.

Frightened, the group escaped and met up with Franky, Sanji, and Kin'emon, and they all ran out of the building and into the shocked view of the Marines of G-5, Smoker, Tashigi, and Law. They immediately turned around and tried to find another exit to avoid any combat. As they were running away, Law used his ability to rearrange the personalities of the Straw Hat Pirates, putting Chopper in Sanji's body and Franky in Chopper's body. After escaping, Chopper (in Sanji's body) helped keep Nami (in Franky's body) from hurting Sanji anymore than she can. The group reunited with Zoro, Luffy, Robin, Brook, and Usopp at the back side of the Punk Hazard facility. The Straw Hats tied up Brownbeard and brought each other up to speed on the current situation. After interrogating Brownbeard, they learned about the scientist Caesar Clown.[54]

Kin'emon later left the group to find his torso and Sanji, Brook, and Zoro go out to find him. In the meantime, Chopper began to examine the children and the source of their sicknesses, while Franky (in Chopper's body) experimented with Chopper's abilities and made weird faces. Before long, several of the giant children started to feel pain, saying that they need the candy usually given to them in order to make the pain go away. However, Chopper stated that the candy contains a drug that the children became addicted to, and Luffy's group learned that the children had been experimented on. One of the giant children hit Luffy and the others went on a rampage, forcing Usopp to put them to sleep. Chopper expressed his sympathy towards the children, and Luffy's group decided to help the children and found Caesar. The group tied up the giant children so that they could not destroy anything else. Luffy, Usopp, Franky, and Robin left Chopper and Nami to watch the children while they headed to Caesar's lab. While they were gone, the Yeti Cool Brothers attacked and gunned down Brownbeard. By the time Luffy's group returned, they had kidnapped Nami.[55]

Luffy and Franky decided to go after the brothers. Franky asked Chopper to give him some Rumble Balls. Chopper gave him one and advised him on how to use it. However, Franky immediately took one, transformed into Monster Point, and went on a rampage while chasing after Luffy.[56]

Alliance with Law and a Plan to Defeat Caesar Clown
Law is Shocked at Straw Hat Antics
Chopper tied to Law's hat.

After the defeat of the Yeti Cool Brothers, Luffy, Franky, Nami, and Law returned to the hideout. Chopper and the rest were shocked that Luffy formed an alliance with Law. Law then returned Chopper to his body and Franky to his. Chopper scolded Luffy and Franky for causing damage to his body. When the Straw Hats insisted for Law to assist them in helping the children, Law asked to take Chopper with him to help find the medicine that was used on the children. Usopp tied Chopper to Law's hat, while the rest laughed at Law. Chopper was tied to his nodachi instead.[57]

Law later warped both himself and Chopper to the back side of the facility to began their part of the plan. The two briefly discussed on how they are going to investigate the drugs. They were later seen inside, where Law managed to lead Monet away while Chopper (hiding inside Law's bag) is left in the room unnoticed. Chopper then left his hiding spot and started sneaking around in the facility.[58]

He later found Luffy's group in Caesar's clutches. Before Caesar sent them outside to die by the poisonous gas cloud created by Smiley, a piece of paper was hurled at Chopper. Chopper read a note, which told him not to do anything. He later ran passed Caesar's location, planning to escape the facility. Chopper managed to acquire enough information of the drug and even got a sedative. As he ran through the hallway, Monet noticed him.[59]

Chopper later met up with Mocha and explained to her about Caesar's deception and using the kids for his experiments and how if Caesar continued to use them, the children would die before they reach adulthood. Mocha remembered her friends promising to each other that when they get older, they would reunite and go on an adventure. The gravity of the situation became clear to Mocha and Chopper promised that he and the rest of the Straw Hat Pirates would save her. While Mocha guarded the candy in the Biscuits Room, Chopper attempted the hold back the children. He later entered Monster Point and was fending off the children in Building B. However, Chopper was unable to fight without hurting the children and was beaten down. When the Rumble Ball wear off, the children ran past him and made their way to the Biscuits Room. At this point, Brook, Kin'emon, Zoro, Nami, Usopp, and Robin came to his aid. Chopper told them that he was trying to prevent the children from getting their candy with the aid of Mocha. The group quickly ran after the children to the Biscuits Room. Regardless of Robin's attempt to hinder them, they went after Mocha, who was holding a piece of candy. After Chopper told Mocha to run, Monet appeared and told Mocha not to keep the candy all to herself and that she should share the candy with the other children.[60]

Mannen Yuki
Monet ensnaring Nami and Chopper with her demonic like snow body.

Chopper and Nami then tended to Robin, but she assured them that her wound was only a cut. Monet tried to attack them when they attempted to run after the children, but Zoro quickly blocked her. After getting hit by Nami's Heat Egg, Monet dove into the snow and stopped Nami, Chopper, and Robin from leaving by creating a wall to block their path. An enraged Monet suddenly ensnared Nami and Chopper and prepared to bite Chopper. Nami swiftly moved Chopper out of harm's way and Robin used her Hana Hana no Mi abilities to shatter Monet, saving Chopper and Nami from another attack. Zoro then cut down the snow barrier, allowing Robin, Nami, and Chopper to go after the children.[61]

Chopper, Nami, and Robin then tried their best to keep the berserk children from catching up to Mocha. While Nami and Robin hinder them, Chopper sedated them one at a time. Despite their efforts, some of the children managed to get around the Straw Hat Pirates and caught Mocha. Having no choice, Mocha put the entire batch of candy in her mouth as Chopper, Nami, and Robin watched in horror. Despite Chopper's pleas, she swallowed all the candy. Mocha then began coughing up blood, due to the serious overdose of the drug. As the children were shocked at what they saw, Chopper yelled at them, saying that Mocha sacrificed herself to save them. As they rushed to Mocha, Sanji and the G-5 Medical Team finally arrived to help. Some of the Marines had Mocha moved to an examination room so Chopper could tend to her condition. Chopper complimented Mocha on her bravery and hoped that he could save her.[62]

Nami, Robin, Sanji, the children, and the G-5 with them went on ahead to Building R as Chopper and the Marines with him treated Mocha.[63] Once Chopper was finished with the treatment, they proceeded to Building R as well. They later ran into Brook and a petrified Kin'emon.[64] Once everyone reached Building R safely, they boarded a rail car and made their escape.[65]

Aftermath
Chopper Celebrating at Punk Hazard Party
Chopper celebrating at the party.

Sometime after Baby 5 and Buffalo's defeat, Law treated the children's conditions in a nearby tanker. When Chopper thought that Law had done something horrible to the children, he screamed and repeatedly called Law a murderer. After Law came out of the ship, Chopper demanded to know what he had done to the children, and Law answered by telling him to mind his own business, and that he had just finished cutting them into pieces. Frightened by this blunt answer, Chopper ran inside and was relieved to see that the children were okay. The kids told Chopper that Law took out all the NHC10 from their bodies and that they felt great, although being cut into pieces was pretty scary. They then talked about Mocha and what she did to save her friends, and asked Chopper if she would wake up. He assured them that she would wake up and that everyone would return home, away from this nightmare. He then left as Tashigi came in and told the children the Marines would take care of them from then on. Later, after Mocha woke up, an overjoyed Chopper hugged her in relief.[66] Everyone then had a feast together.

After the party ended, Chopper and the rest of the Straw Hats began to prepare to set sail again. As they were leaving, Nami told Chopper that Vegapunk would help cure the kids from the effects of the candy. Chopper reacted by saying that it that was very good news. While they made their way, the G-5 Marines put up a banner to prevent the kids from seeing the Straw Hats while yelling things like Marines are justice and pirates are scum. The kids, however, said that they were the ones who saved them, while remembering all the Straw Hats did for them. The G-5 Marines continued to speak ill of pirates and praised the Marines, but Tashigi interrupted them and said that they were a disgrace. The G-5 Marines responded by saying that if they did not badmouth the pirates, they would come to admire and respect them. Eventually the Marines lowered their voices and banners to let the kids say their goodbyes, while Chopper and the rest of the Straw Hats waved them goodbye, as they made their way to their ship.[67]

Chopper and the Straw Hat Pirates were later seen on a Sea Slope, which Law mentions is pretty common in their current area. A little while later, Luffy started to explain that they formed an alliance to take down an Emperor. Chopper continued to treat Caesar's injuries, until he began to say that they are practically making themselves targets to the big shots of the New World. He continued to taunt them, and called them a larger group of idiots and that only death awaited them. Sanji responded by kicking Caesar, which in turn angered Chopper, saying that he was still treating his wounds, and that Sanji could kick him after he was done with that.[68]

Law then proceeded to explain the operations and underworld deals of all the major pirates of the New World and that Doflamingo, also known as Joker, is the one with the most influence in the underworld.[68] Law continued on, saying that Doflamingo's biggest client is Kaidou, which greatly shocked Kin'emon and Momonosuke. Law continued to explain the next goal of their plan, which is to cut down Kaidou's forces as much as possible, specifically his army of synthetic devil fruit users. When Law informed the crew that the current number of Synthetic devil fruit users is about 500, Chopper, Usopp, and Nami voted against the plan but without success. Law assured the crew that the number would not grow any time soon, due to the capture of Caesar Clown. Chopper complimented Caesar about his manufacturing of the synthetic devil fruits which made Caesar quite happy and Usopp quite angry. Law then said that it was really Vegapunk that developed a theory on the devil fruits, and that Caesar only applied it, which made Chopper lose all interest in Caesar. Law concluded by saying that the devil fruits are being made on their next destination, Dressrosa, and also warned the crew to not underestimate Doflamingo. Luffy then asked Kin'emon if he had business on Dressrosa and Kin'emon revealed that one of his comrades was being held prisoner there.[69]

Later that evening, Chopper and Usopp went on guard duty while wearing samurai armor.[70] The next morning, everyone read the news about Doflamingo's resignation from the Shichibukai. They saw that the paper also explained Luffy and Law's alliance and the alliance among Eustass Kid, Basil Hawkins, and Scratchmen Apoo.[71]

Dressrosa Arc
The Next Objective
After Law contacted Doflamingo to inform him that they would bring Caesar to Green Bit, Chopper had a meal with the rest of the crew while Kin'emon and Momonosuke told them the story about how they were shipwrecked and drifted to Dressrosa, how Momonosuke was separated from his father, and how Kanjuro was captured. The Thousand Sunny later approached Dressrosa.[72]

After disembarking, the group split into three teams. Chopper was part of the team that guarded the Thousand Sunny. Chopper freaked out when he saw that Sanji was not part of his group.[73]

Momonosuke later played shogun with Chopper, Nami, and Brook. When Brook started singing a song, they heard strange noises and a voice coming from the men's room.[74]

Brook, Nami, Chopper and Momonosuke Transformed
Nami, Brook, Chopper and Momonosuke transformed into art.

The voice belonged to Giolla of the Donquixote Pirates, who had invaded the ship along with several of her subordinates. Using her Devil Fruit power, she turned the men's room into abstract art and then did the same to Nami, Chopper, Brook, and Momonosuke. Hoping to lure Giolla away from the ship, Chopper and Brook left on the Shark Submerge III while Nami and Momonosuke rode the Shiro Mokuba I, but Giolla transformed the ship into art anyway, rendering it unable to sail.[75]

Chopper, Nami, and Brook attempted to fight back and managed to defeat Giolla's men and destroy her ship. Giolla used her Devil Fruit powers to turn Chopper's hooves and horns into art, rendering them useless. The three Straw Hats then received a call from Law. They begged Law to come save them, but instead, Law ordered them to bring the Thousand Sunny to Green Bit.[76]

Giolla later trapped Chopper, Momonosuke, and Nami in a deadly painting that would slowly suffocate them in ten minutes. Brook acted nonchalant, seemingly caring more about the art that was being created than his friends' lives. The skeleton asked Giolla to turn his violin and cane back to normal so that he could add accompaniment to their death. Once Giolla complied, Brook then slashed her using Drawing Song Hitoyogiri, defeating her and causing her power to wear off, turning everyone back to normal.[77]

Giolla Defeated
Nami's group incapacitating Giolla.

Later on, Nami's group kept attacking Giolla to ensure she was completely incapacitated.[78] They discussed what to do with Giolla and wondered why Law was not handing Caesar back to Doflamingo. Giolla proudly informed them that Doflamingo never quit the Shichibukai and explained his gambit to them, leaving them shocked and worried. As they got close to Green Bit, Nami's group was horrified to see Fighting Fish attacking the Sunny. When they saw Doflamingo approaching the ship, they cried in terror but were overjoyed and relieved when Sanji intercepted him.[79]
A Change of Plans
When Sanji was overwhelmed and immobilized by Doflamingo's strings, Nami's group panicked. Doflamingo was about to deal a lethal blow to Sanji, but Law intervened by using Shambles and teleported Sanji, Caesar, and himself to the Thousand Sunny. Law then instructed Nami's group to head for Zou. Nami's group was reluctant to leave behind the other Straw Hats, but they complied when they realized that the ship was facing threats from both Doflamingo and Fujitora. After blocking an attack from Doflamingo, Law informed the Straw Hats about Doflamingo's Devil Fruit powers and instructed them to go to a place without clouds. Law then took Giolla hostage, giving Nami's group enough time to escape using Coup de Burst.[80]

After sailing far away from Dressrosa, Chopper expressed his concern for Law.[81] When Zoro finally made contact with Luffy at the Corrida Colosseum, the group on the Sunny engaged in a conference call with both Luffy and Franky's group. After everyone was brought up to speed and learned about the true situation on Dressrosa, Sanji decided to sail back to Dressrosa to carry out their assault on Doflamingo, much to Chopper's dismay.[82]

Through the Den Den Mushi, the group on the Sunny heard the skirmish occurring at the Corrida Colosseum and was shocked to hear that an Admiral was also present in Dressrosa. To make matters worse, the return trip was cut short by the appearance of the Big Mom Pirates, who were after Caesar Clown. Since returning to Dressrosa was not a wise option, Chopper and the others on the Thousand Sunny continued on to Zou.[83]

The Next Island
Chopper Uses Caesar as a Net
Chopper uses Caesar to guard against enemy fire.

Chopper and the others managed to deal some damage to the enemy pirate ship when Chopper assumed Monster Point and used Caesar as a net to catch incoming cannonballs that Brook had slashed and frozen with Soul Solid, allowing Sanji to kick them back with Diable Jambe, igniting Caesar's gas and sending the fiery cannonballs crashing into the side of Big Mom's ship. Since none of the crew present knew how to use the Coup de Burst, they eluded the Big Mom Pirates thanks to a fog Nami created.[84] They arrived at Zou the next day. After forcing Caesar to take them on the giant elephant's back, they came across Sheepshead chasing after Tristan. After saving Tristan and running from Sheepshead, they found Zou's ruined city covered in poison gas and the devastated Mink Tribe. Pedro begged Chopper's group to help Inuarashi and Nekomamushi.[85] When Caesar acted pleased on how destructive the poison gas weapon used by the Beasts Pirates was, Chopper angrily beat him up.[86]

Some time later back on the Thousand Sunny, Chopper was eager to go and save Tristan, and had to berate Caesar for wanting to stay on the ship. After the brief conflict with another band of pirates, Chopper yelled at everyone to come to his location quickly.[87]

Creating Koro Antidote

Several days later, they discovered that two members of the Big Mom Pirates, Pekoms and Capone Bege, had arrived at Zou. Sanji and Brook then spoke with the Big Mom Pirates members in private. After Bege shot Pekoms in the back for agreeing to let the Straw Hats go, he summoned his men from his body and captured Caesar and Sanji's group, except Momonosuke, who had locked himself inside his room. Bege then took them inside his body to continue the conversation with the Straw Hats. While talking to Sanji, Bege gave him an invitation to the Big Mom Pirates' wedding Tea Party. Bege also identified him as the third son of the Vinsmoke Family and indicated he would be marrying Pudding, the 35th daughter of the Charlotte Family.[89]

Sanji Frees Crewmates from Bege's Body
Sanji frees Chopper, Nami, and Brook from Bege's captivity.

As the other Straw Hats reacted to the news, they remembered Sanji's mysterious comment that he was born in the North Blue. After writing a note, Sanji gave it to his friends. He apologized to his crew, explaining it was not his intention to hide things from them. He then threw Nami, Chopper, and Brook out of Bege's body.

Sanji snatched a rifle from one of the Fire Tank Pirates and held Caesar at gunpoint to prevent Bege's crew from going after his comrades. As Nami, Chopper, and Brook plead for Sanji to stay with them, Sanji promised that he would return before Bege fled with him and Caesar. His disheartened friends were now left with just a note which made light of the situation.[90]

Reunion with Luffy
Chopper and Nami Reunite with Their Crew
Chopper and Nami reunite with the rest of the crew.

After Luffy and his group arrived at Zou, Chopper and Nami resided in Rightflank Forest. Nami was sleeping on a giant sheep mink when Chopper informed her that Luffy and his group arrived. Chopper and Nami then quickly went to greet them.[91]

While feasting with the minks, Chopper and Nami explained to Luffy's group about how the Thousand Sunny group escaped the Big Mom Pirates. When Chopper heard that Duke Inuarashi regained consciousness, Chopper and two mink doctors, Miyagi and Tristan, went to check up on him.[92]

After Wanda brought the rest of the Straw Hats to Duke Inuarashi's home, Chopper welcomed them. When Wanda mentioned about a weapon Jack used against the Mink Tribe, Chopper revealed that it was one of Caesar's poison gas weapons.[93]

When Wanda finished with her recollection on the devastation Jack caused and the Mink Tribe's salvation, Chopper decided to visit Nekomamushi and the Guardians. The Straw Hats, Wanda, and Carrot then traveled to the Whale Forest.[94]

Journey to Nekomamushi
The Straw Hats go off to see Nekomamushi.

After explaining about the circumstances concerning Sanji's departure from Zou, Chopper wondered if they will never get to see Sanji again. Zoro expressed apathy for the situation, much to Chopper's anger. After Luffy declared that he would ask Sanji himself, Chopper told them that Pekoms was left behind, so they could ask him some questions.

After arriving at the Whale Forest, Chopper was told by a reindeer mink, Milky, with whom he is entranced, that Nekomamushi was inside his home taking a bath, which shocked him.

When Chopper found Nekomamushi eating lasagna while taking a bath, he yelled at the feline mink that he was not allowed to take baths, as his wounds would reopen, and was supposed to eat light foods and not use his left hand. Nekomamushi replied that he loved freedom as he walked out of the bath, and Chopper yelled at him for ignoring his orders. When he started playing with a ball, his wounds reopened. Nekomamushi ended up in bed, which he claimed was because he wanted to be. Chopper gave him an injection while he played with a foxtail. Nekomamushi claimed that he felt better already, but Chopper smacked him and told him to lie down.[95]

Chopper, Robin, Usopp, and Brook then went to see Luffy, who was visiting Pekoms alongside Nami and Zoro. Chopper was in disbelief to see Nekomamushi following them. After Nekomamushi carelessly injured himself while greeting Luffy and Zoro, Chopper panicked and once again tended to his wounds as Law and his crew arrived. After Law warned them about the threat of Kaidou, Nekomamushi partied with both the Straw Hats (except Robin, Franky, and Brook) and the Heart Pirates.[96]

Revelations and a New Alliance
On the next morning, Chopper and his group heard a bell ringing and realized that Kin'emon and Kanjuro had arrived. They quickly rushed to find them, fearing what would happen if the Mink Tribe meets the samurais. The Straw Hats managed to intercept Kin'emon, Kanjuro, and Momonosuke just as they arrived at Kurau City and tried desperately to keep them hidden. However, as Nekomamushi and Inuarashi were fighting, Kin'emon and Kanjuro revealed themselves. Contrary to what the Straw Hats expected, the Mink Tribe welcomed the samurais and revealed that Raizo is safe. The Straw Hats were stunned to learn that the minks knew about Raizo all along and went to great lengths to keep him hidden despite the abuse they suffered.[97]

The Straw Hats were further shocked when Kin'emon revealed that Momonosuke was not his son, but rather the heir to the daimyo of Kuri. Inuarashi and Nekomamushi then took the Straw Hats, Law, and the samurais to Raizo's location in a secret area inside the whale-shaped tree. As they journeyed there, Chopper and the male pirates began fantasizing on what Raizo would be, imagining him to be a stereotypical ninja. When they saw Raizo, they were shocked at his ugly appearance, but still begged him to perform tricks. Raizo initially refused, but relented after the Straw Hats began sulking. They were then awestruck as Raizo performed his ninja arts.[98]

Chopper, Luffy, and Usopp then accompanied Kin'emon, Kanjuro, and Raizo as they stood outside the Whale Tree, expressing their sorrows as they saw the state Zou was in after Jack's attack. When Robin deciphered the red poneglyph hidden in the Whale Tree, Nekomamushi called them back in. Inuarashi then explained to the Straw Hats about the four Road Poneglyphs and they listened in anticipation as he revealed how they can lead to Laugh Tale. When Nekomamushi revealed that Kaidou and Big Mom each possessed one Road Poneglyph, Chopper, Usopp, Nami, and Brook were deeply shocked. The Straw Hats were then surprised when Nekomamushi revealed that Momonosuke's ancestors created the poneglyhs. However, the samurais explained that Momonosuke never inherited the knowledge of the poneglyphs due to the execution of Lord Oden at the hands of Kaidou and the shogun of Wano. The Straw Hats also learned that Oden was part of Roger's crew and had been on Laugh Tale with him as well as the Beasts Pirates' objective in obtaining the secret that Oden knew.[99]

Right after Luffy agreed to form an alliance with the samurais and the Mink Tribe,[100] the group left the secret room. Afterwards, Chopper and the others learned that Inuarashi and Nekomamushi traveled with Oden and had been on the ships of both Whitebeard and Gol D. Roger. The alliance decided to split up to accomplish different tasks and meet up again at Wano. Chopper, Nami, and Brook chose to accompany Luffy in his mission to rescue Sanji. However, before they could start their operation, they felt Zou shaking and heard Zunesha crying.[101]

As everything shook around them, they witnessed Luffy and Momonosuke's ability to hear Zunesha's voice. They then heard from Momonosuke that Jack returned to Zou and started attacking Zunesha. On Momonosuke's command, Zunesha sank Jack's fleet with one blow. With the threat of Jack ended, everyone became calm again.[102]

Chopper and Minks Heal Zunesha

Chopper, Miyagi, and many other minks then treated Zunesha's injured leg. After Luffy retrieved Pekoms and Pedro volunteered to join the Sanji Retrieval Team, Luffy's group departed from Zou. Everyone, except the Straw Hat members left behind, were shocked when Luffy jumped off Zunesha with his party.[103]
Journey to Whole Cake Island
As they sailed towards Whole Cake Island on the Thousand Sunny, Chopper, Nami, and Brook were still recovering from the shock of Luffy's stunt at Zou. They were then surprised to see Carrot has snuck aboard the ship. After she begged them not to turn back, the group allowed her to come along. When the crew got hungry, Luffy insisted on preparing a meal himself because Nami was going to charge them money for the food.[104]

Chopper and the rest of the Sanji Retrieval Team then learned from a newspaper about the Blackbeard Pirates' attack on the Revolutionary Army's headquarters on Baltigo, surprising everyone on board. After passing through a storm, Luffy presented his dish, which the group did not enjoy in the least. Luffy then admitted that he used up all the food they had and the group found themselves in a food shortage crisis.[105]

Luffy Gets Fish Poisoned
Chopper panics when Luffy is brought to the brink of death.

A few days later, the group was famished from the lack of food and overheated as they passed through boiling waters. They were saved from starvation when Luffy managed to catch a gigantic fish. Chopper quickly get the encyclopedia with information on the fish. The group, except for Luffy, enjoyed a meal prepared by Nami using Sanji's recipe. Luffy was incapacitated by food poisoning after eating the fish's toxic skin, causing Chopper to worry for him. After entering Big Mom's waters, the group was approached by a ship belonging to Germa 66.[106]

When they saw a hooded man aboard the ship, the group mistook him for Sanji until the man revealed himself to be Sanji's younger brother, Vinsmoke Yonji. Chopper was deeply shocked due to Yonji's resemblance to Sanji. When Luffy's condition worsened, Chopper begged Yonji for an antidote. Yonji then taunted the group to try to take the antidote by force. Sanji's older sister, Vinsmoke Reiju, appeared and kicked Yonji for his rudeness. She then boarded the Thousand Sunny and cured Luffy by sucking the poison out of him. With Luffy's life saved, Chopper was overjoyed. Yonji and Reiju then departed without reporting the Sanji Retrieval Team's presence.[107]

Luffy and Chopper Eat a Cafe
Chopper and Luffy eat an entire cafe at Cacao Island.

The group later docked at Cacao Island, an island close to Whole Cake Island. After seeing buildings made of chocolate, Chopper and Luffy went ahead to explore the island. When they ate a café, a policeman confronted them and was about to arrest them. The owner of the café, Charlotte Pudding, arrived and came to their defense, saying that they were hired to dismantle the café. After she saved Chopper and Luffy, the Sanji Retrieval Team accompanied her home where she offered them food.[108]

The Sanji Retrieval Team was then shocked to learn that the woman they were conversing with was Sanji's bride-to-be, who in turn, was surprised to discover that the group was from the Straw Hat crew. After calming down, Chopper and the team listened as Pudding explained more about the Charlotte Family and her thoughts about Sanji. Chopper was shocked to hear that Sanji turned her down. Pudding then showed them a secret route to Whole Cake Island and told them where to meet her while promising to bring Sanji to them. The Sanji Retrieval Team then left in a hurry when guards arrived for Pudding and quickly returned to the Thousand Sunny. Pekoms was nowhere to be seen and they found a message telling them to turn back.

The Thousand Sunny was later attacked by a giant aquatic centipede, causing Chopper and Nami to run in fear as the rest of the team prepared to battle it.[109]

The team later battled a swarm of giant ants before getting trapped in a frozen sea of syrup as night fell. As they worked to unfreeze the sea, Chopper and the rest of the team listened as Pedro revealed his past history in Totto Land and his plan to steal Big Mom's Road Poneglyph.

The next day, the team reached Whole Cake Island.[110]

After docking at the southwestern coast of Whole Cake Island, the team split into two groups, with Pedro and Brook departing to find Big Mom's Road Poneglyph. Right after Chopper's group disembarked on the island, Luffy saw what appeared to be Sanji in the nearby forest. Luffy, Chopper, and Carrot ran after him with Nami following them, but Sanji mysteriously disappeared. Chopper, Luffy, and Carrot headed into the woods to look for Sanji, but kept getting distracted by their sweet environment. They were nearly eaten by a talking crocodile, and things only grew more shocking as Luffy encountered his living reflection. Chopper, Carrot, and Nami saw Sanji on a tree branch, which disappeared, and they pursued a fleeing figure. They encountered a large man buried up to his neck, whose lack of sense deeply infuriated Chopper. They were then suddenly attacked by a rabbit named Randolph riding a crane, and were thrown into chaos as everything in the Seducing Woods came alive to trap and kill them.[111]

Chopper, Nami, and Carrot continued running from Randolph, although Carrot managed to stop the rabbit's steed using Electro. Randolph hurled its spear at the Sanji Retrieval Team, but they dodged it as they returned to the fighting Luffys. Chopper, Nami, and Carrot unwittingly took the reflection Luffy back to the shore, but to their surprise they ended up in the exact same location after crossing the river, as though the forest had been mirrored. The reflection Luffy then revealed herself to be Charlotte Brûlée and prepared to attack Nami and Carrot.[112]

Chopper Subdued by Homies
Chopper is overwhelmed by several tree homies.

After Brûlée trapped Carrot in the Mirro-World, she explained to Chopper and Nami that Big Mom was well aware of their movements and had given orders to prevent them from meeting up with Sanji. When Brûlée ordered the living trees in the Seducing Woods to subdue the two Straw Hats, Chopper ate a Rumble Ball and transformed into Monster Point. Chopper fought off the trees to help Nami escape so she could go search for Luffy.[113] Chopper was later captured by Brûlée and trapped in the Mirro-World alongside Carrot. After Brûlée arrived at the scene where Charlotte Cracker was confronting Nami and Luffy, Brûlée smashed her mirror into pieces. However, Chopper and Carrot remained unharmed.[114]

Inside the Mirro-World, a shackled Chopper told Carrot, also shackled, that he had a plan, and so she should call him "Brother Chopper". Carrot referred to him as "Choniki" and asked what the plan was. Chopper explained his realization that the Mirro-World is connected to every mirror on Whole Cake Island. Thus, instead of trying to escape, they should use Brûlée's power against her.[115]

Eleven hours later, Carrot and Chopper were running from Brûlée inside the Mirro-World, but began to grow tired.[116] As they ran, Chopper and Carrot contacted Nami through a mirror shard and told her not to worry. However, their conversation abruptly ended.[117]

Chopper Defeats Noble Croc
Chopper defeats the Noble Croc.

Chopper and Carrot were caught by Brûlée and taken to her house.[118] However, they managed to trick Brûlée into capturing a frog that she had made into a body double of Carrot instead of Carrot herself, and Chopper was chained in Heavy Point, so he planned to have the real Carrot come in and attack while he escaped by returning to his normal form. From there, he could activate Monster Point and help take down all the enemies. When Carrot ambushed Brûlée's group and defeated Brûlée, Chopper freed himself and activated Monster Point, allowing him to flip the Noble Croc on top of several of Brûlée's subordinates, defeating them. After he and Carrot defeated everyone in the house, they celebrated and prepared to visit their allies through the mirrors.[119]

Chopper and Carrot Traverse the Mirro-World
Chopper and Carrot look for their teammates in Mirro-World.

With Brûlée as their prisoner, Chopper and Carrot raced through the Mirro-World using Diesel to find Luffy and the others.[120] After Carrot woke Brûlée up, Brûlée revealed that they could ask the mirrors to show the way to the castle. Chopper then asked the mirrors to show the location of their friends.[121] Chopper and Carrot located Pedro and made a plan for him to end his battle with Tamago. As Pedro blew up a large amount of explosives inside his jacket, Chopper and Carrot pulled him into the Mirro-World. As they continued traveling in the Mirro-World, Chopper and Carrot were informed of Luffy and Nami's capture but were later told by the mirrors that Nami was with Jinbe.[122] Once they located Jinbe and Nami, Chopper attempted to retrieve them but was accidentally shocked by Nami's thundercloud. After taking Nami and Jinbe into the Mirro-World, the group went on searching for Luffy, Brook, and Sanji.[123]

Chopper's group located Brook inside Big Mom's bedroom, being held in her hands as she slept. Brûlée tried to alert her mother, causing the team to bind and gag her and Diesel. Upon witnessing Big Mom and her three homies attacking a fly, the team became terrified, wondering how they were supposed to save Brook. The team then made a skeletal lookalike for Brook, which they planned to use to make a stand-in for the real Brook. Chopper snuck into the room, but accidentally sneezed, causing Big Mom to semi-consciously slam her hand down on where he was standing. After Jinbe and Nami rescued Brook from Big Mom's clutches, Chopper was surprised to see that Brook successfully copied the poneglyphs and hid the copies inside his skull. The team celebrated Brook's accomplishment, and Chopper declared that they have only one objective remaining: to retrieve Sanji.[124]

Chopper was worried when none of the mirrors were able to locate Sanji and Luffy. He started crying and seemed devastated to learn from Nami that the two of them had a fight.[125] They managed to contact Luffy and Sanji through a mirror shard and they were surprised when Luffy decided to ruin the wedding ceremony. Chopper then listened as Jinbe explained more about Bege, such as his backstory and him plotting against Big Mom. He was shocked when Jinbe proposed to form an alliance with Bege. Luffy agreed to meet with Bege even though Chopper voted against this.[126]

The Wedding
Straw Hat Pirates Meet Fire Tank Pirates
The Sanji Retrieval Team meets with the Fire Tank Pirates.

Chopper and his group arrived at Bege's hideout before Luffy and Sanji. After taking a bath, Chopper greeted Luffy and Sanji once they arrived. After the rest of the team finished with their baths, Chopper accompanied them inside the meeting room.[127] During the meeting between the two groups, Chopper heard about how Bege planned to exploit a certain weakness of Big Mom. The meeting adjourned once Bege finished going over his assassination plan.[128]

Nami, Chopper, and Carrot Hide in Wedding Cake
Chopper, Nami, and Carrot wait inside the wedding cake for their cue.

Bege took the alliance members to the wedding in his castle, and Chopper slept for the first time in three days.[129] After the wedding ceremony began, the team initially encountered a small problem when Jinbe had difficulty waking Luffy up. After they woke Luffy with food, the team went into the Mirro-World and prepared to charge into the venue.[130] Once they heard the signal, the team unleashed duplicates of Luffy into the venue, causing chaos at the ceremony. After releasing all the duplicates, the team charged in. Chopper, Nami, and Carrot then hid inside the ruined wedding cake, waiting for the photo of Mother Carmel to be destroyed. They then watched in amazement as Jinbe officially declared to Big Mom his intention to leave the Big Mom Pirates in order to join Luffy's crew.[131]

Sanji Saves his Family
Chopper gives the Vinsmoke Family earplugs as Sanji frees them.

Three seconds after Brook destroyed Carmel's portrait, Chopper, Carrot, and Nami were confused as to why Big Mom did not already start screaming. However, they were later told by Bege to put on their earplugs as he initiated his assassination operation.[132] When Luffy caused Big Mom to start her strange scream, Chopper's group came out of hiding. Chopper then gave earplugs to the Vinsmokes right after Sanji freed them from their restraints.[133]

Chopper then watched as Bege, Vito, and Gotti fired their KX Launchers at Big Mom. However, Big Mom's scream detonated the rockets before they could reach her. With the assassination attempt a failure, Caesar flew into the venue with the escape mirror and Bege signaled the alliance members to retreat. Before they could escape into the mirror, Big Mom's scream shattered it, leaving them trapped in the venue. After Bege transformed into Big Father, he instructed the alliance to retreat inside.[134] Before he could do so, Chopper was restrained by Oven, but was released after Niji attacked Oven. Chopper then retreated successfully into Bege's fortress, along with the rest of the alliance. Inside, Chopper and Nami shivered in terror as Bege explained about the dire situation they were in.[135]

Escape from Totto Land
As Bege's fortress suffered damage from Big Mom's attacks, Luffy prepared to fight her, but Nami had Chopper restrain him. Chopper then listened as Bege came up with a plan to escape with Caesar's help. After the Vinsmoke Family exited Bege's body to distract the Big Mom Pirates, Chopper cried in shock when Luffy and Sanji engaged Big Mom in combat to save Reiju.[136] While Caesar was evading the Big Mom Pirates with Bege in tow, Chopper cheered for him.[137]

Just when the Big Mom Pirates routed Luffy's group, Bege's crew, and the Vinsmokes, the Tamatebako dropped to the base of the Whole Cake Chateau and exploded, causing the castle to topple over. As the castle collapsed, Luffy's group, Bege's crew, and the Vinsmoke Family got away. The Sanji Retrieval Team and the Fire Tank Pirates rendezvous at the northwest part of Whole Cake Island, where Luffy and Bege agreed to go their separate ways. After Bege left, Chopper and Brook volunteered to retrieve the Shark Submerge and take it back to the Thousand Sunny.[138]

Brook and Chopper Defend the Sunny
Chopper and Brook fight to take back the Sunny.

After retrieving the Shark Submerge, Chopper and Brook navigated through the juice river back to the coast where the Sunny was located. While eating some of the cream from the transformed Whole Cake Chateau, Chopper spotted a merman fishing underwater. Once they returned to their ship, they found Charlotte Perospero, Charlotte Katakuri, and an army of chess soldiers on board. The two Straw Hats then prepared to fight to take back their ship.[139] On the Sunny's deck, Chopper and Brook fought and defeated numerous Chess Soldiers. Knowing that the soldiers were coming from the mirror in Nami's room, Brook told Chopper to smash it.[140]

Perospero then took direct action against Chopper and Brook, covering them with candy and intending to kill them by turning them into candy. However, the Sanji Retrieval Team managed to return to the ship, but they were still chased by Big Mom. After Perospero trapped the ship in candy, Chopper and Brook watched in shock as Pedro attempted to take out Perospero with a suicidal explosion.[141]

Thanks to Pedro's sacrifice, the candy encasing Chopper and Brook dissolved, freeing them. They then helped Nami and Jinbe prepare the ship. After Luffy grabbed and dragged Katakuri into the Mirro-World, Chopper and his group on the Thousand Sunny escaped Whole Cake Island with a Coup de Burst.[142]

As the team mourned Pedro's self sacrifice and lamented on their inability to save him, Jinbe encouraged them to press on and keep their guard up. With the team spurred into action, Chopper gained some confidence and Nami had him take the helm as they sailed to Cacao Island.[143]

The Sanji Retrieval Team Plan to Meet at Cacao Island
The Sanji Retrieval Team plan their next move.

While under siege by the Big Mom Pirates, the team encountered another dire predicament when Big Mom created a massive wave homie to engulf the Thousand Sunny.[144] However, thanks to Jinbe's skills as a helmsman, the team managed to come out of that situation unharmed. They then contacted Luffy through a mirror shard and told him to find a mirror connecting to Cacao Island so they could meet him there.[145]

On the way to Cacao Island, the group on the Sunny was puzzled when they saw no pursuers. Chopper and Carrot kept a vigilant lookout.[146] As they were getting closer to Cacao Island, Jinbe told the group to prepare for a battle. Carrot informed Chopper that a full moon was coming.[147] The group on the Sunny was later surprised to find themselves once again pursued by Big Mom and a fleet of Tarteships.[148] They were initially able to hold their own, but they later discovered another fleet of Tarteships led by Daifuku in front of them. As they were about to be surrounded by the Big Mom Pirates, they thought about a counterattack. Carrot told the rest of the team to leave this to her, and they watched with amazement as Carrot transformed into her Sulong form and launched an attack on Daifuku's crew.[149]

Chopper Protects Nami From Big Mom
Chopper uses Guard Point to protect Nami from Big Mom.

Chopper continued to watch in awe of Carrot's strength, but Jinbe revealed that Carrot faced the risk of severe exhaustion if she used the Sulong form for too long. After Brook carried Carrot back to the Thousand Sunny, Chopper and his group later faced despair after Big Mom summoned Zeus and Prometheus back to her and went to attack the Sunny.[150] Chopper watched as Big Mom tore the Sunny apart looking for the wedding cake and sent Jinbe flying into the ocean. When she tried attacking Nami, Chopper blocked her attack using Guard Point. After Jinbe returned and knocked Big Mom off the ship using Fish-Man Karate, Chopper was amazed. Big Mom then prepared to slice the entire Sunny in half, but Nami and Brook managed to manipulate Zeus into discharging all its power, engulfing Big Mom in a massive blast of lightning, which gave the Straw Hats the chance to flee.[151] As Big Mom continued to chase after the Thousand Sunny with Prometheus in gigantic size, Chopper (in his Monster Point) struggled to defend the Sunny from Big Mom's onslaughts.[152] As the Nostra Castello approached the Thousand Sunny, Chopper was overjoyed to see Sanji again. After Pudding brought Sanji to the Straw Hats' ship, the group happily welcomed him back. With the Fire Tank Pirates luring Big Mom away with the cake, the Straw Hats continued on to Cacao Island to retrieve Luffy. On the way, the group on the Sunny learned from Sanji that the Big Mom Pirates were aware of their rendezvous point.[153]

After Sanji and Pudding went ahead to Cacao Island to help Luffy, the group on the Sunny evade Smoothie's attacks. Chopper asked Carrot if Inuarahsi and Nekomamushi could transform like she did.[154] As the promised rendezvous time drew near, Nami pointed out that Luffy needed Brûlée in order to leave the Mirro-World, causing the group to become concerned, given Luffy's absent-mindedness. With a few minutes remaining, Cacao Island was in sight.[155] As they approached the island, they saw the massive fleet that the Big Mom Pirates assembled there. They were overjoyed to hear from Sanji that Luffy made it out of the Mirro-World. The group was then bewildered when they saw the Big Mom Pirates' fleet suddenly engulfed in flames.[156]

As they witnessed Germa 66 attacking the Big Mom Pirates, Sanji told them to sail past the port at full speed. The Sunny group did so and they were overjoyed to see Sanji and Luffy coming towards them.[157] Luffy and Sanji returned to the Sunny and Chopper quickly tended to Luffy's injuries. The group was then besieged by Smoothie's fleet, but Judge came to their rescue. After the Sunny passed by Judge's castle, the group later saw enemy ships approaching them from the front and when the situation grew more dire, they were surprised when Wadatsumi appeared and attacked the enemy.[158]

The Sun Pirates cleared a path for the Sunny. However, despite their efforts, the Sunny was intercepted and attacked by the Queen Mama Chanter.[159] Wadatsumi saved the Sunny by switching it with the Sun Pirates' ship and hid the Sunny in his mouth. Wadatsumi tried swimming away, but Oven attacked him with heat waves, forcing him to spit out the Sunny. As the Sun Pirates held back the Big Mom Pirates, Jinbe decided to stay behind to help them and Luffy consented to his decision. After Jinbe joined his former crew in battle, the Sunny group sailed far away from Cacao Island.[160]

With the Big Mom Pirates unable to pursue, the Sunny group successfully escaped Totto Land. After some rest, Sanji cooked a meal for them.[161]

Levely Arc
Journey to Wano
After Sanji realized that he received a raid suit from Niji during the escape from Cacao Island, Chopper and Luffy begged him not to throw it away. Carrot received a newspaper and showed it to the group. They then saw that Sanji and Luffy received new bounties. Initially, the group misread Luffy's new bounty as Beli150,000,000. Brook later took a closer look at the poster and the group was then shocked to hear that Luffy's bounty actually increased to Beli1,500,000,000.[162]

Wano Country Saga
Wano Country Arc
Infiltration in Wano Country
As the Thousand Sunny continued towards Wano Country, the group was informed of the Levely through a newspaper and Chopper was overjoyed to see Kureha on the newspaper. He even cut out parts of the newspaper to keep for himself. The group then encountered an unusual weather disturbance in their direction, followed by an octopus on their ship as well as a school of huge carp on their side. After a bumpy ride across a river, the ship climbed up a waterfall. Once they reached the top, they came across a whirlpool.[163] Sanji carried Nami, Chopper, Carrot, and Brook away from the ship, but Luffy got dragged into the whirlpool along with the Sunny.[164]

After Luffy got separated, the group searched for him, but they only found his Vivre Card. They later got in touch with Kin'emon and they reunited with Luffy at the ruins of Oden Castle. With Law, Momonosuke, and Kiku also present, Kin'emon explained how he and his group traveled through time to escape Orochi's attack twenty years ago.[165] Chopper then listened as Kin'emon explained more about the past such as the story of Oden, the time of his execution, the rumor about Toki, and what Kin'emon's group did right after arriving at present time. Kin'emon then went over a plan to attack Onigashima, the island where Kaidou resided, in two weeks.[166]

Kin'emon explained more about the Fire Festival and how the decisive battle would play out. He then gave the group specific tasks to do. He asked Chopper and Carrot to go with Kiku to Inuarashi's current location. After giving the group new clothes, he introduced them to Shinobu. When Kaidou arrived at Kuri, Law alerted the group.[167] The group was surprised to see Kaidou and they learned that Luffy, Zoro, and Law were already exposed. Luffy rushed off to protect Okobore Town and Law chased after him and told the rest to remain unseen. After Kin'emon and Kiku left to rescue Tsuru, the rest at Oden Castle noticed Kaidou coming to their direction and tried to flee as Kaidou destroyed the castle with a fire breath.[168] Shinobu saved the males of the group by using her Devil Fruit power to sink them into the ground while Sanji carried Carrot and Nami away. Kiku then returned and told them what happened to Luffy.[169]

Chopper was next seen in Tama's house at Amigasa Village tending to Tama. Chopper assured her that Luffy has incredible recovery speed and his will would not be broken and that Raizo was planning on rescuing him.[170]

An Unexpected Visitor and Raid at Udon
Chopper, Tama, Kiku, and Momonosuke went to Kuri Beach, where they found Big Mom lying unconscious. Chopper panicked upon seeing her, and when she woke up, Chopper was surprised that she lost her memories.[171] On the following morning, Chopper's group took Big Mom to Okobore Town. Though Chopper was worried about Big Mom regaining her memories, Tama insisted on taking her to Udon. Chopper then told Big Mom that she could find more food in that region, making her eager to go there.[172]

The group then traveled to Udon, with Big Mom having tamed a Wanizame to carry them there. On the way there, Big Mom soon started to get hungry, asking how far Udon was while hungrily eyeing Chopper, much to his discomfort.[173] As Tama and Big Mom were talking about oshiruko, Chopper worried what would happen if Big Mom did not find any at Udon.[174] After night fell, the group eventually arrived at Udon.[175]

On the next day, Chopper's group entered the Prisoner Mines after Big Mom broke through the front gate. Kiku informed Chopper that Queen was in charge of the prison and told him to proceed with caution. As Chopper and Kiku were sneaking in, they witnessed Big Mom attacking Queen.[176] Chopper and Kiku were amazed to see Big Mom overpowering Queen. They then became worried for Luffy when he invoked Big Mom's wrath by admitting he ate the oshiruko that Big Mom was looking for.[177] Chopper and Kiku were shocked when Big Mom sent Luffy and Hyougoro flying into a wall.[178]

Luffy's Group Fights in Udon
Chopper and his allies prepare to take over Udon.

After Queen left with a captured Big Mom, Kiku asked Chopper about rescuing her, but he had no intention of going after her and said that getting Luffy was more important. Chopper and Kiku then heard Kawamatsu's voice coming from a nearby cell. After Raizo freed Kawamatsu, Chopper joined up with Luffy and their allies. Chopper was surprised to learn that Kiku is actually a man.[179] As Chopper and his allies fought against the Beasts Pirates, Chopper was angry that they used viruses as weapons. The group was then cornered by prisoners who were infected with the Mummy virus. Chopper was worried when Luffy made contact with the infected prisoners.[180]

After the prison takeover, Chopper worked on treating Luffy's condition and reprimanded Luffy for his recklessness. He also threw Momonosuke out of the room.[181] Chopper successfully developed a cure for the Mummy virus and treated Luffy and all those infected.[182]

Raid On Onigashima
Two days before the raid on Onigashima, Chopper returned to Amigasa Village with Luffy and Tama.[183] Chopper was also given a new armor by Tenguyama Hitetsu.[184]

On the day of the Fire Festival, the Straw Hats sailed to Tokage Port on the Thousand Sunny to join the Scabbards and enter the battle with the Beasts Pirates.[185]

While Kanjuro fled to Onigashima with Momonosuke in tow, the Straw Hats learned that Kanjuro was a spy working for Orochi. As the alliance was attacked by a Beasts Pirates ship with long ranged cannons, the Straw Hats were overjoyed to see Jinbe arriving and joining the battle.[186] With Jinbe officially part of the crew, the Straw Hats proceeded to take over the torii in front of Onigashima; however, Chopper, Nami and Usopp hid on the ship while the others fought.[187] The crew then arrived at Onigashima with the rebels. After disembarking, Chopper received a Beasts Pirates disguise from Kin'emon.[188]

Big Mom Chasing Tank
Chopper fleeing from Big Mom.

As the Straw Hats made their way into Kaidou's stronghold, Chopper traveled in the Brachio Tank V.[189] The group in the tank and Kin'emon's forces reached the Pleasure Hall owned by Black Maria. After Nami, Carrot, and Shinobu volunteered to go look for Momonosuke, Chopper was later spotted by Big Mom when she was looking out of a window from one of the nearby buildings.[190] Chopper and Usopp fired a shot at Big Mom with the tank's cannon before fleeing from her.[191] The two managed to get away from Big Mom with minor injuries and the Brachio Tank V intact.[192]

Straw Hats Stand United Against Beasts Pirates

Later upon hearing of Momonosuke's upcoming execution, the two decided to go and rescue him but accidentally enter the room with the Numbers.[193] While still inside the tank, Chopper and Usopp were caught by Jaki, one of the Numbers, but they were later freed by Franky at the Live Stage, where upon exiting the tank, they rejoined the rest of the Straw Hats onstage.[194]

After Queen entered the fray, Chopper and Robin were alarmed when Queen used Excite Bullets on the rebels.[195] Chopper, Robin, and Brook soon found themselves besieged by those infected by the Ice Oni virus. When Queen tossed the antidote to Apoo, Chopper told Zoro to take the antidote from him.[196] When Chopper began working on analyzing the virus' distribution factors, he was horrified to learn from Robin that he too had been infected when his right arm began to freeze.[197] Just as Zoro defeated Apoo and gave Chopper the antidote, Chopper finished his analysis and told everyone that exposing the victims to heat could prevent the spread of the virus. He also promised to produce enough antibodies for everyone.[198]

After Marco arrived, he used his flames to revert the effects of the Ice Oni, which also restored Chopper's arm back to normal. Once Tristan and Miyagi arrived, they began to work on mass-producing the antidote, while X Drake and the yakuza bosses volunteered to protect them as Queen ordered his men to steal back the antidote.[199]

Chopper Hits Queen
Chopper attacks Queen.

Later, Chopper managed to finish mass-producing the antidote, Chopperphage. In the nick of time, he saved the infected Hyougoro when Yatappe was about to kill him. Chopper put the antidote in Hyougoro's mouth and cured him. Miyagi and Tristan came in and distributed the antidote with a cannon, curing all the infected. Chopper then explained to Queen how he was able to mass-produce the cure. When Queen angrily asked why he bothered to cure his subordinates, Chopper said that viruses were not meant to be weaponized, as even the user would lose control. Queen refused to be lectured by Chopper and tried to kill him, but the Pleasures used themselves as shields for him. Marco took this opportunity to grab Queen by the neck, giving Chopper an opening to strike. Chopper thanked Marco and took a Rumble Ball, changing into his Monster Point form. He then struck Queen while also yelling to everyone present that he is not a "Tanuki", which they had been calling him constantly.[200]

However, as the battle continued, even though he had extended the duration of the effect of Rumble Balls to 30 minutes, and despite landing several strong blows on Queen, it is clear that the Plague was just playing with the reindeer. Furthermore, Charlotte Perospero joined the battlefield in support of Queen, raining a shower of Candy arrows all over the battlefield, which worsened the situation for the Alliance.[201] Chopper's motivation took a dip when the news about Luffy's defeat and apparent death was broadcasted via the Marys. At this point Queen came in for a fatal strike on the depressed reindeer, while Perospero unleashed another arrow rain. Suddenly Sanji appeared and kicked the Brachiosaurus zoan, sending Queen spinning which simultaneously knocked away the arrows as well as Peresporo with its gigantic body. Sanji praised Chopper for holding out against the All-Star before telling him to stop crying for Luffy, reminding the reindeers of all their captain's miracles. He then casually chucking the heavily wounded Zoro to Chopper for the doctor to attend to. When Momonosuke used the Marys to announce Luffy's message, Chopper was immensely relieved, now crying tears of joy.[202] Chopper transformed into a new Babyjiji form due to the side effects of the improved Rumble Ball, which turned his body into an infant hybrid form, while he starts talking like an old man. Having learnt that Miyagi possessed a super recovery medicine that would instantly heal a person, he is quite surprised, though the goat Mink cautioned that there would be powerful side effects.[203]

Chopper then observed as the Mink injected the shot into Zoro, [204] a fact Chopper would later share with Sanji when Sanji advised Chopper to flee if the medicine should not work to which Chopper replied it was just taking longer due to Zoro's condition.[205] Together with the two Minks, Chopper witnessed Zoro and Sanji engaging in fierce combat with King and Queen[206] and after the duo split to fight their separate battles, was very nervous when he saw Queen being able to crush Sanji's bones with his Brachiojaurus technique, but was even more stunned when Sanji was able to walk away with a body full of broken bones, before mending said broken bones in a matter of moments. Chopper was again shocked when Sanji's face broke Queen's sword leaving Chopper surprised that Sanji survived this attack.[207][208] Eventually, the side effects of the Rumble Ball would fade, turning Chopper back into his normal form. Chopper had, however, concerns about Zoro's well being, as he was worried that, if Zoro won his fight, the medicine he was given earlier would double the damage he would receive from his fight with King, worrying that Zoro might die from the fight and the medicine.[209]

Unknown to him, Luffy lost his fight against Kaidou and when Kaidou descended to the castle declaring he killed Luffy, Chopper started to cry hearing these words.[210] He was later in tears and in shock when he witnessed Luffy's gigantic arm descending from the ceiling and pulling Kaidou back to the rooftop.[211] As the island was burning, Chopper reunited with Nami and told her that he can't find the rest of the crew with Nami replying that with the giant fire, they can't go anywhere. Chopper asked Zeus if he could use his rain to put out the fire, but Zeus responds that he would only get himself burned. Later, as Onigashima grew unstable, Chopper, alongside everyone else, tumbled throughout the Live Floor of the Skull Dome.[212]

After the Raid on Onigashima ended, Usopp brought the unconscious Kin'emon and Kikunojo, alongside Franky who brought Zoro to Chopper for treatment. Miyagi and Tristan reported to Chopper that several others needed his attention, which prompted Chopper to ask for help with.[213] Chopper then treated Luffy's and Zoro's injuries.[214]

A New Dawn in Wano Country
A week later, Chopper and with most of the crew gathered in the shogun's castle. After Luffy and Zoro woke up, Chopper jumped onto Zoro's head. Later, Chopper joined the men's bath.[215] He later joined Yamato and Luffy at the second festival, having fun and eating, and cheered when the alliance celebrated their victory.[216] A few days later, Chopper was with the rest of crew when Robin explained her discovery of the Poneglyph and of Pluton being in Wano.[217]

A couple of days later, the crew left the castle in the middle of the night and by morning were prepared to leave from Tokage Port, only to be met by Yamato and an angry Momonosuke and Kin'emon, who were upset that nobody had given them a proper goodbye. As the two tearfully thanked the crew for everything and finally said there goodbyes, Nami planned for the crew to go to Mogura Port so they could leave safely, which pleased Chopper. However, after being taunted by Kid for playing it safe, Luffy forced the ship to go over the waterfall again, much to everyone's frustration.[218] After a rough landing, the crew began to sail away from Wano.

Final Saga
Egghead Arc
Days after leaving Wano, an angry Nami locked Luffy in a cage as punishment for endangering the crew again. When Jinbe tried to get her to go easier on him, she scolded Jinbe, and Chopper warned Jinbe not to mess with Nami when she is angry. As Robin read out their new bounties and status in the world, Chopper was upset about his bounty, but Robin made him feel better by giving him some cotton candy.[219] Chopper became upset again when he heard the news about the Levely, including Vivi's disappearance and Sabo's assassination of Cobra. Chopper immediately wanted to go rescue Vivi along with everyone else, and was very upset when Zoro tried to talk all of them out of it due to the danger of doing so, with all of them childishly stating that they were still allowed to be worried about her. Despite hearing the news, Luffy was convinced of his brother's innocence, and told everyone about the promise he, Sabo, and Ace had made as children, even stating the ultimate goal of their dream, which shocked everyone. After hearing that, Chopper smiled in amazement at what Luffy had said, while Sanji laughed and asked Chopper to check Luffy's head.

A few days later, the group experienced harsh weather, at which point they discovered a massive column of water in the air, which Nami claimed was a warm eddy that was being pushed upward. As the others began to notice someone was trapped in the eddy, Chopper came out of the cabin and was immediately blown away by the strong winds. As Luffy tried to grab Chopper and pull him back, he was blown away with him into the ocean, alongside the girl who was freed from the eddy by Zoro.[220] As this happened, Jinbe went after them, and ship was attacked while he rescued them, leading to Jinbe taking them all ahead to the island. As the group reached a cave and dried themselves off, the girl began to grow into a young woman and then introduced herself as Jewelry Bonney. After telling all three of them that the island they were on was called Egghead, she explained that she had come alone without her crew to find Dr. Vegapunk and get him to undo what he had done to her father, which surprised them.[221]

After reaching the island's surface, they stopped and were amazed by the island's futuristic look, with Bonney and Chopper trying to eat a dessert that they had found. When they all failed to touch the objects, Jinbe realized that they were holograms, to the annoyance of the others. As Jinbe began questioning why the island's weather was so different from the outside, Atlas arrived and began explaining why. When Luffy touched her to see whether she was another hologram, she angrily punched him away, right into a machine that produces food. As Luffy, Bonney and Chopper began stuffing their faces, Jinbe asked her who she is, and she introduced herself as Dr. Vegapunk, specially Vegapunk #5, Atlas, which shocked and confused the others.[222]

Luffy and Chopper find the ancient Iron Giant on Egghead.

As the three finish stuffing themselves, Atlas leaves to finish her work, and then more people begin to suddenly appear, with a confused Chopper wondering were they all came from. When Luffy finds a machine that gives him new clothes, Chopper and the others try it for themselves. As Bonney prepares to leave the three of them, Luffy tells them that Bartholomew Kuma is coming. As Luffy prepares to fight the Pacifista, he is stopped by Bonney, tearfully tells them that Kuma is her father and begs them not to hurt him. As Luffy tries to tell her that it's not the real Kuma, the Pacifista fires a laser at them, causing an explosion.[223] They avoid the blast and then manage to allude the Pacifista, due to Bonney's abilities, and eventually end up at a junkyard. There, Jinbe and Luffy explain the situation to Bonney, and Chopper, feeling bad for her, explains that they have their own bad history with Pacifistas. Jinbe then goes on to tell Bonney and the others everything he knows about Kuma, wondering what the tyrant did to end up as a cyborg. An angry Bonney defends her father, telling them that everything about him being a tyrant is false, and that he was forced into his current situation because he's a part of special race and the government just wanted to use him. She then picks up a beam saber and turns everyone back to their normal ages.[224] The group goes deeper into the junkyard and finds a giant, ancient rusted robot. As Chopper and Luffy try to get it to work, they hear someone in the junk ask for help, and Luffy pulls an elderly man out, who turns out to be Dr. Vegapunk.[225]

Vegapunk thanks them and begins telling them all about himself, and his Nomi Nomi no Mi power, and how his head and brain are constantly growing to the point that he had to cut parts of it off, which shocked Chopper. Chopper then listened to Vegapunk explaining that he took the removed part of his brain and turned it into a knowledge repository known as Punk Records. As Chopper listened in amazement at Vegapunk's dreams and achievements, he was interrupted by an angry Bonney, who held the beam saber to his head and demanded that he turn Kuma back to normal or else she’ll kill him. However, the weapon Bonney tries to use on Vegapunk ends up being defective, attracting a large number of insects, which shocks Bonney into unconsciousness. As Chopper checks on her, Vegapunk talks to Luffy about one of his old inventions, and then asks him if he'd help him escape from Egghead. As Vegapunk tries to explain why he needs to leave and he and Jinbe discuss the matter further, the group becomes aware of CP0's arrival to the island.[226] Running out of time, he asks Luffy again for help, to which he agrees.

A thankful Vegapunk tells the Straw hats where to go, and asks them to bring Bonney along, before teleporting away, which surprises Chopper and Luffy. As they head to the lab with Bonney, the group runs into CP0, with Luffy and Rob Lucci staring each other down.[227] Despite Chopper's protest, Luffy sees an injured Atlas and decides to help her, leading to another fight with Lucci, causing Chopper to run off with Bonney and Jinbe to carry Atlas to safety.[228] As the fighting continues, Sentomaru and the Seraphim arrives to the scene, with Chopper and Jinbe realizing that they are clones of the ex-Warlords, however, instead of helping Lucci, Sentomaru orders the Seraphim to help the Straw Hats into the lab and to hold off the government agents, leading to Lucci striking down Sentomaru to take control of the seraphim.[229] Despite this, Luffy still overwhelms Lucci, and Sentomaru regains consciousness long enough for the Seraphim to finish helping Luffy's group to the Labophase.

After entering the lab, and leaving Atlas for repairs, Bonney, now awake, goes off after Vegapunk again. As Chopper and Luffy try to find her and stop her they met up with the others, who tell them that not only is she not there but nether is Vegapunk; and then they all watch as CP0 and the Seraphim reach the labophase and try to attack it. However, they are stopped by Zoro and Brook, who end up receiving help from one of the agents, Stussy, who turns out to be Vegapunk's spy.[230] As CP0 is taken out, and the Seraphim are neutralized, the groups reunite as Shaka informs everyone that the main Vegapunk is still missing, and that the building is on lockdown. As everyone splits up to find Vegapunk (except for Luffy and Zoro who stay behind to watch Lucci and Kaku), Robin and Chopper are paired up with Atlas, who takes them looking on a floor filled with machines producing artificial organs for medical purposes.[231] When the other groups are attacked by the Seraphim, Robin noticed the seraphim might be on the loose again and might be trying to stop the search for Vegapunk by killing everyone. After hearing this, Atlas then suggested that she might know where Vegapunk could be, with Robin and Chopper following her to the location.[232] Afterwards Chopper regrouped with Vegapunk and the rest of the crew and went to eat Sanji's food.[233] Chopper tended to Robin's injuries, getting flustered as usual from her compliments.[234]

Saturn Attacks Robin
Chopper jumps to Robin's defense.

Later, Chopper, Nami, and Usopp attempted to leave the Labophase while carriying Robin in a pod with them.[235] When Sanji informed them of the incoming Buster Call, Chopper panicked, but continuing to treat Robin.[236] Shortly after Chopper spotted the Giant Warrior Pirates, namely Oimo and Kashii and was happy to see the two again.[237] Afterward, Chopper and the others caught wind of Vegapunk's pre recorded message being signaled across the island, questioning where came from and why it started now.[238] The group discussed how they could cover the distance needed to avoid crashing sunny to land on sea, shortly after, Jaygarcia Saturn climbed to the crews location to Chopper's shock.[239]

Upon arriving in the Labophase, Saturn instantly recognized Robin, and moved to kill her. On Nami's order, the Straw Hats jumped to her defense as Saturn attempted to attack.[240] Chopper and The Straw Hats were brushed aside by Saturn, but the others were caught in Robins Spider Net while Chopper remained in Guard Point. After Saturn left, Nami pointed out to the group that the clouds they were on begun to extend with Brook and Usopp realizing that it was done by Edison so their ship could reach the sea.[241] Chopper noticed that the cloud's ceased extending, leaving enough room for the ship to land but was quickly horrified when the Elder Nusjuro caught up to their location.[242] While Atlas sacrificed herself to hold off Nusjuro, Chopper clung to Jinbe as they blasted off.[243]
